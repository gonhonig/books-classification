      "CHAPTER I.",
      "Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice without pictures or conversations?",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear!",
      "Oh dear!",
      "I shall be late!",
      "(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.",
      "First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.",
      "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE , but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",
      "Well!",
      "thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!",
      "How brave they ll all think me at home!",
      "Why, I wouldn t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!",
      "(Which was very likely true.)",
      "Down, down, down.",
      "Would the fall _never_ come to an end?",
      "I wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time?",
      "she said aloud.",
      "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.",
      "Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) yes, that s about the right distance but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to?",
      "(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)",
      "Presently she began again.",
      "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth!",
      "How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!",
      "The Antipathies, I think (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all the right word) but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.",
      "Please, Ma am, is this New Zealand or Australia?",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy _curtseying_ as you re falling through the air!",
      "Do you think you could manage it?)",
      "And what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking!",
      "No, it ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.",
      "There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.",
      "Dinah ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!",
      "(Dinah was the cat.)",
      "I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.",
      "Dinah my dear!",
      "I wish you were down here with me!",
      "There are no mice in the air, I m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s very like a mouse, you know.",
      "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?",
      "And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats?",
      "Do cats eat bats?",
      "and sometimes, Do bats eat cats?",
      "for, you see, as she couldn t answer either question, it didn t much matter which way she put it.",
      "She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?",
      "when suddenly, thump!",
      "thump!",
      "down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.",
      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it s getting!",
      "She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!",
      "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.",
      "However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; and even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders.",
      "Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!",
      "I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ( which certainly was not here before, said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large letters.",
      "It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry.",
      "No, I ll look first, she said, and see whether it s marked _poison_ or not ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",
      "However, this bottle was _not_ marked poison, so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",
      "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * What a curious feeling!",
      "said Alice; I must be shutting up like a telescope.",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; for it might end, you know, said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle.",
      "I wonder what I should be like then?",
      "And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!",
      "when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.",
      "Come, there s no use in crying like that!",
      "said Alice to herself, rather sharply; I advise you to leave off this minute!",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.",
      "But it s no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two people!",
      "Why, there s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants.",
      "Well, I ll eat it, said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I ll get into the garden, and I don t care which happens!",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way?",
      "Which way?",
      ", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.",
      "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
      "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II.",
      "The Pool of Tears Curiouser and curiouser!",
      "cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); now I m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!",
      "Good-bye, feet!",
      "(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).",
      "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
      "I m sure _I_ shan t be able!",
      "I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; but I must be kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they won t walk the way I want to go!",
      "Let me see: I ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.",
      "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.",
      "They must go by the carrier, she thought; and how funny it ll seem, sending presents to one s own feet!",
      "And how odd the directions will look!",
      "_Alice s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with Alice s love_).",
      "Oh dear, what nonsense I m talking!",
      "Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",
      "Poor Alice!",
      "It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this), to go on crying in this way!",
      "Stop this moment, I tell you!",
      "But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
      "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",
      "It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh!",
      "the Duchess, the Duchess!",
      "Oh!",
      "won t she be savage if I ve kept her waiting!",
      "Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please, sir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
      "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear!",
      "How queer everything is to-day!",
      "And yesterday things went on just as usual.",
      "I wonder if I ve been changed in the night?",
      "Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?",
      "I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.",
      "But if I m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?",
      "Ah, _that s_ the great puzzle!",
      "And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
      "I m sure I m not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all; and I m sure I can t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!",
      "she knows such a very little!",
      "Besides, _she s_ she, and _I m_ I, and oh dear, how puzzling it all is!",
      "I ll try if I know all the things I used to know.",
      "Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is oh dear!",
      "I shall never get to twenty at that rate!",
      "However, the Multiplication Table doesn t signify: let s try Geography.",
      "London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome no, _that s_ all wrong, I m certain!",
      "I must have been changed for Mabel!",
      "I ll try and say _How doth the little_ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do: How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale!",
      "How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!",
      "I m sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!",
      "ever so many lessons to learn!",
      "No, I ve made up my mind about it; if I m Mabel, I ll stay down here!",
      "It ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear!",
      "I shall only look up and say Who am I then?",
      "Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I ll come up: if not, I ll stay down here till I m somebody else but, oh dear!",
      "cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!",
      "I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking.",
      "How _can_ I have done that?",
      "she thought.",
      "I must be growing small again.",
      "She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
      "That _was_ a narrow escape!",
      "said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; and now for the garden!",
      "and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!",
      "the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this before, never!",
      "And I declare it s too bad, that it is!",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water.",
      "Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by railway, she said to herself.",
      "(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)",
      "However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",
      "I wish I hadn t cried so much!",
      "said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.",
      "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!",
      "That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure!",
      "However, everything is queer to-day.",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.",
      "Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse?",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there s no harm in trying.",
      "So she began: O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?",
      "I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother s Latin Grammar, A mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse O mouse! )",
      "The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",
      "Perhaps it doesn t understand English, thought Alice; I daresay it s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.",
      "(For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)",
      "So she began again: O est ma chatte?",
      "which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.",
      "The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.",
      "Oh, I beg your pardon!",
      "cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings.",
      "I quite forgot you didn t like cats.",
      "Not like cats!",
      "cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.",
      "Would _you_ like cats if you were me?",
      "Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone: don t be angry about it.",
      "And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.",
      "She is such a dear quiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh, I beg your pardon!",
      "cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.",
      "We won t talk about her any more if you d rather not.",
      "We indeed!",
      "cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.",
      "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!",
      "Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!",
      "Don t let me hear the name again!",
      "I won t indeed!",
      "said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.",
      "Are you are you fond of of dogs?",
      "The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!",
      "And it ll fetch things when you throw them, and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things I can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it s so useful, it s worth a hundred pounds!",
      "He says it kills all the rats and oh dear!",
      "cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, I m afraid I ve offended it again!",
      "For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
      "So she called softly after it, Mouse dear!",
      "Do come back again, and we won t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don t like them!",
      "When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then I ll tell you my history, and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
      "Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
      "CHAPTER III.",
      "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.",
      "Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am older than you, and must know better; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!",
      "_I ll_ soon make you dry enough!",
      "They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.",
      "Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",
      "Ahem!",
      "said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready?",
      "This is the driest thing I know.",
      "Silence all round, if you please!",
      "William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.",
      "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria Ugh!",
      "said the Lory, with a shiver.",
      "I beg your pardon!",
      "said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: Did you speak?",
      "Not I!",
      "said the Lory hastily.",
      "I thought you did, said the Mouse.",
      "I proceed.",
      "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable Found _what_?",
      "said the Duck.",
      "Found _it_, the Mouse replied rather crossly: of course you know what it means.",
      "I know what it means well enough, when _I_ find a thing, said the Duck: it s generally a frog or a worm.",
      "The question is, what did the archbishop find?",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.",
      "William s conduct at first was moderate.",
      "But the insolence of his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear?",
      "it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.",
      "As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone: it doesn t seem to dry me at all.",
      "In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies Speak English!",
      "said the Eaglet.",
      "I don t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what s more, I don t believe you do either!",
      "And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.",
      "What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.",
      "What _is_ a Caucus-race?",
      "said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
      "Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it.",
      "(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ( the exact shape doesn t matter, it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.",
      "There was no One, two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.",
      "However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over!",
      "and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won?",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",
      "At last the Dodo said, _Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.",
      "But who is to give the prizes?",
      "quite a chorus of voices asked.",
      "Why, _she_, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, Prizes!",
      "Prizes!",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.",
      "There was exactly one a-piece, all round.",
      "But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.",
      "Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely.",
      "What else have you got in your pocket?",
      "he went on, turning to Alice.",
      "Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.",
      "Hand it over here, said the Dodo.",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
      "You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice, and why it is you hate C and D, she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.",
      "Mine is a long and a sad tale!",
      "said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.",
      "It _is_ a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse s tail; but why do you call it sad?",
      "And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this: Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.",
      "Come, I ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I ve nothing to do.",
      "Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.",
      "I ll be judge, I ll be jury, Said cunning old Fury: I ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.",
      "You are not attending!",
      "said the Mouse to Alice severely.",
      "What are you thinking of?",
      "I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly: you had got to the fifth bend, I think?",
      "I had _not!_ cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
      "A knot!",
      "said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.",
      "Oh, do let me help to undo it!",
      "I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.",
      "You insult me by talking such nonsense!",
      "I didn t mean it!",
      "pleaded poor Alice.",
      "But you re so easily offended, you know!",
      "The Mouse only growled in reply.",
      "Please come back and finish your story!",
      "Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do!",
      "but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
      "What a pity it wouldn t stay!",
      "sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter Ah, my dear!",
      "Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _your_ temper!",
      "Hold your tongue, Ma!",
      "said the young Crab, a little snappishly.",
      "You re enough to try the patience of an oyster!",
      "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!",
      "said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular.",
      "She d soon fetch it back!",
      "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?",
      "said the Lory.",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: Dinah s our cat.",
      "And she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think!",
      "And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!",
      "Why, she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.",
      "Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn t suit my throat!",
      "and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, Come away, my dears!",
      "It s high time you were all in bed!",
      "On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.",
      "I wish I hadn t mentioned Dinah!",
      "she said to herself in a melancholy tone.",
      "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I m sure she s the best cat in the world!",
      "Oh, my dear Dinah!",
      "I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!",
      "And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.",
      "In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.",
      "CHAPTER IV.",
      "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess!",
      "The Duchess!",
      "Oh my dear paws!",
      "Oh my fur and whiskers!",
      "She ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!",
      "Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?",
      "Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here?",
      "Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!",
      "Quick, now!",
      "And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.",
      "He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran.",
      "How surprised he ll be when he finds out who I am!",
      "But I d better take him his fan and gloves that is, if I can find them.",
      "As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it.",
      "She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.",
      "How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for a rabbit!",
      "I suppose Dinah ll be sending me on messages next!",
      "And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: Miss Alice!",
      "Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!",
      "Coming in a minute, nurse!",
      "But I ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out.",
      "Only I don t think, Alice went on, that they d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.",
      "There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.",
      "I know _something_ interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything; so I ll just see what this bottle does.",
      "I do hope it ll make me grow large again, for really I m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",
      "She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself That s quite enough I hope I shan t grow any more As it is, I can t get out at the door I do wish I hadn t drunk quite so much!",
      "Alas!",
      "it was too late to wish that!",
      "She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I can do no more, whatever happens.",
      "What _will_ become of me?",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
      "It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.",
      "I almost wish I hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole and yet and yet it s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!",
      "I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me!",
      "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!",
      "And when I grow up, I ll write one but I m grown up now, she added in a sorrowful tone; at least there s no room to grow up any more _here_.",
      "But then, thought Alice, shall I _never_ get any older than I am now?",
      "That ll be a comfort, one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn!",
      "Oh, I shouldn t like _that!_ Oh, you foolish Alice!",
      "she answered herself.",
      "How can you learn lessons in here?",
      "Why, there s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all for any lesson-books!",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
      "Mary Ann!",
      "said the voice.",
      "Fetch me my gloves this moment!",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.",
      "Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.",
      "Alice heard it say to itself Then I ll go round and get in at the window.",
      "_That_ you won t!",
      "thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.",
      "She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
      "Next came an angry voice the Rabbit s Pat!",
      "Pat!",
      "Where are you?",
      "And then a voice she had never heard before, Sure then I m here!",
      "Digging for apples, yer honour!",
      "Digging for apples, indeed!",
      "said the Rabbit angrily.",
      "Here!",
      "Come and help me out of _this!_ (Sounds of more broken glass.)",
      "Now tell me, Pat, what s that in the window?",
      "Sure, it s an arm, yer honour!",
      "(He pronounced it arrum. )",
      "An arm, you goose!",
      "Who ever saw one that size?",
      "Why, it fills the whole window!",
      "Sure, it does, yer honour: but it s an arm for all that.",
      "Well, it s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, Sure, I don t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!",
      "Do as I tell you, you coward!",
      "and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.",
      "This time there were _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.",
      "What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "I wonder what they ll do next!",
      "As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could!_ I m sure _I_ don t want to stay in here any longer!",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: Where s the other ladder?",
      "Why, I hadn t to bring but one; Bill s got the other Bill!",
      "fetch it here, lad!",
      "Here, put em up at this corner No, tie em together first they don t reach half high enough yet Oh!",
      "they ll do well enough; don t be particular Here, Bill!",
      "catch hold of this rope Will the roof bear?",
      "Mind that loose slate Oh, it s coming down!",
      "Heads below!",
      "(a loud crash) Now, who did that?",
      "It was Bill, I fancy Who s to go down the chimney?",
      "Nay, _I_ shan t!",
      "_You_ do it!",
      "_That_ I won t, then!",
      "Bill s to go down Here, Bill!",
      "the master says you re to go down the chimney!",
      "So Bill s got to come down the chimney, has he?",
      "said Alice to herself.",
      "Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!",
      "I wouldn t be in Bill s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I _think_ I can kick a little!",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill!",
      "then the Rabbit s voice along Catch him, you by the hedge!",
      "then silence, and then another confusion of voices Hold up his head Brandy now Don t choke him How was it, old fellow?",
      "What happened to you?",
      "Tell us all about it!",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ( That s Bill, thought Alice,) Well, I hardly know No more, thank ye; I m better now but I m a deal too flustered to tell you all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!",
      "So you did, old fellow!",
      "said the others.",
      "We must burn the house down!",
      "said the Rabbit s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, If you do, I ll set Dinah at you!",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I wonder what they _will_ do next!",
      "If they had any sense, they d take the roof off.",
      "After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with.",
      "A barrowful of _what?_ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.",
      "I ll put a stop to this, she said to herself, and shouted out, You d better not do that again!",
      "which produced another dead silence.",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.",
      "If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, it s sure to make _some_ change in my size; and as it can t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.",
      "As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.",
      "The first thing I ve got to do, said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.",
      "I think that will be the best plan.",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.",
      "Poor little thing!",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
      "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!",
      "said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if if I d only been the right size to do it!",
      "I d nearly forgotten that I ve got to grow up again!",
      "Let me see how _is_ it to be managed?",
      "I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?",
      "The great question certainly was, what?",
      "Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",
      "CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
      "Who are _you?_ said the Caterpillar.",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.",
      "Alice replied, rather shyly, I I hardly know, sir, just at present at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.",
      "What do you mean by that?",
      "said the Caterpillar sternly.",
      "Explain yourself!",
      "I can t explain _myself_, I m afraid, sir, said Alice, because I m not myself, you see.",
      "I don t see, said the Caterpillar.",
      "I m afraid I can t put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely, for I can t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.",
      "It isn t, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, perhaps you haven t found it so yet, said Alice; but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day, you know and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you ll feel it a little queer, won t you?",
      "Not a bit, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice; all I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.",
      "You!",
      "said the Caterpillar contemptuously.",
      "Who are _you?_ Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.",
      "Why?",
      "said the Caterpillar.",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.",
      "Come back!",
      "the Caterpillar called after her.",
      "I ve something important to say!",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.",
      "Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Is that all?",
      "said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.",
      "No, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",
      "For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you think you re changed, do you?",
      "I m afraid I am, sir, said Alice; I can t remember things as I used and I don t keep the same size for ten minutes together!",
      "Can t remember _what_ things?",
      "Well, I ve tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all came different!",
      "Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
      "Repeat, _You are old, Father William_, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began: You are old, Father William, the young man said, And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head Do you think, at your age, it is right?",
      "In my youth, Father William replied to his son, I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I m perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.",
      "You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door Pray, what is the reason of that?",
      "In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box Allow me to sell you a couple?",
      "You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak Pray, how did you manage to do it?",
      "In my youth, said his father, I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.",
      "You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose What made you so awfully clever?",
      "I have answered three questions, and that is enough, Said his father; don t give yourself airs!",
      "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
      "Be off, or I ll kick you down stairs!",
      "That is not said right, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Not _quite_ right, I m afraid, said Alice, timidly; some of the words have got altered.",
      "It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.",
      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
      "What size do you want to be?",
      "it asked.",
      "Oh, I m not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied; only one doesn t like changing so often, you know.",
      "I _don t_ know, said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
      "Are you content now?",
      "Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn t mind, said Alice: three inches is such a wretched height to be.",
      "It is a very good height indeed!",
      "said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
      "But I m not used to it!",
      "pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",
      "And she thought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended!",
      "You ll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.",
      "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.",
      "Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.",
      "One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_ thought Alice to herself.",
      "Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.",
      "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",
      "And now which is which?",
      "she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.",
      "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.",
      "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Come, my head s free at last!",
      "said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
      "What _can_ all that green stuff be?",
      "said Alice.",
      "And where _have_ my shoulders got to?",
      "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can t see you?",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.",
      "She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
      "Serpent!",
      "screamed the Pigeon.",
      "I m _not_ a serpent!",
      "said Alice indignantly.",
      "Let me alone!",
      "Serpent, I say again!",
      "repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, I ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!",
      "I haven t the least idea what you re talking about, said Alice.",
      "I ve tried the roots of trees, and I ve tried banks, and I ve tried hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; but those serpents!",
      "There s no pleasing them!",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
      "As if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon; but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",
      "Why, I haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!",
      "I m very sorry you ve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.",
      "And just as I d taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!",
      "Ugh, Serpent!",
      "But I m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!",
      "I m a I m a Well!",
      "_What_ are you?",
      "said the Pigeon.",
      "I can see you re trying to invent something!",
      "I I m a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",
      "A likely story indeed!",
      "said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.",
      "I ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that!",
      "No, no!",
      "You re a serpent; and there s no use denying it.",
      "I suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!",
      "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful child; but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.",
      "I don t believe it, said the Pigeon; but if they do, why then they re a kind of serpent, that s all I can say.",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, You re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent?",
      "It matters a good deal to _me_, said Alice hastily; but I m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn t want _yours_: I don t like them raw.",
      "Well, be off, then!",
      "said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",
      "Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.",
      "After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.",
      "Come, there s half my plan done now!",
      "How puzzling all these changes are!",
      "I m never sure what I m going to be, from one minute to another!",
      "However, I ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?",
      "As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.",
      "Whoever lives there, thought Alice, it ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!",
      "So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
      "CHAPTER VI.",
      "Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish) and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.",
      "It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.",
      "She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess.",
      "An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.",
      "The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen.",
      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
      "There s no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for two reasons.",
      "First, because I m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.",
      "And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.",
      "Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in?",
      "There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on without attending to her, if we had the door between us.",
      "For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.",
      "But perhaps he can t help it, she said to herself; his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head.",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.",
      "How am I to get in?",
      "she repeated, aloud.",
      "I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
      "or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.",
      "asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
      "_Are_ you to get in at all?",
      "said the Footman.",
      "That s the first question, you know.",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.",
      "It s really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue.",
      "It s enough to drive one crazy!",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.",
      "I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for days and days.",
      "But what am _I_ to do?",
      "Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.",
      "Oh, there s no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately: he s perfectly idiotic!",
      "And she opened the door and went in.",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
      "There s certainly too much pepper in that soup!",
      "Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air.",
      "Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause.",
      "The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
      "Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why your cat grins like that?",
      "It s a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and that s why.",
      "Pig!",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again: I didn t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn t know that cats _could_ grin.",
      "They all can, said the Duchess; and most of em do.",
      "I don t know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.",
      "You don t know much, said the Duchess; and that s a fact.",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.",
      "While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.",
      "The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
      "Oh, _please_ mind what you re doing!",
      "cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.",
      "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!",
      "as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.",
      "If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.",
      "Which would _not_ be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.",
      "Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!",
      "You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head!",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve?",
      "I Oh, don t bother _me_, said the Duchess; I never could abide figures!",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.",
      "CHORUS.",
      "(In which the cook and the baby joined): Wow!",
      "wow!",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words: I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!",
      "you may nurse it a bit, if you like!",
      "the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.",
      "I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room.",
      "The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, just like a star-fish, thought Alice.",
      "The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.",
      "If I don t take this child away with me, thought Alice, they re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind?",
      "She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).",
      "Don t grunt, said Alice; that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.",
      "There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.",
      "But perhaps it was only sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.",
      "No, there were no tears.",
      "If you re going to turn into a pig, my dear, said Alice, seriously, I ll have nothing more to do with you.",
      "Mind now!",
      "The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?",
      "when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",
      "This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.",
      "If it had grown up, she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.",
      "And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.",
      "It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
      "Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.",
      "Come, it s pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on.",
      "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
      "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat.",
      "I don t much care where said Alice.",
      "Then it doesn t matter which way you go, said the Cat.",
      "so long as I get _somewhere_, Alice added as an explanation.",
      "Oh, you re sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long enough.",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.",
      "What sort of people live about here?",
      "In _that_ direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives a Hatter: and in _that_ direction, waving the other paw, lives a March Hare.",
      "Visit either you like: they re both mad.",
      "But I don t want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.",
      "Oh, you can t help that, said the Cat: we re all mad here.",
      "I m mad.",
      "You re mad.",
      "How do you know I m mad?",
      "You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldn t have come here.",
      "Alice didn t think that proved it at all; however, she went on And how do you know that you re mad?",
      "To begin with, said the Cat, a dog s not mad.",
      "You grant that?",
      "I suppose so, said Alice.",
      "Well, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when it s angry, and wags its tail when it s pleased.",
      "Now _I_ growl when I m pleased, and wag my tail when I m angry.",
      "Therefore I m mad.",
      "_I_ call it purring, not growling, said Alice.",
      "Call it what you like, said the Cat.",
      "Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?",
      "I should like it very much, said Alice, but I haven t been invited yet.",
      "You ll see me there, said the Cat, and vanished.",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.",
      "While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.",
      "By-the-bye, what became of the baby?",
      "said the Cat.",
      "I d nearly forgotten to ask.",
      "It turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.",
      "I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again.",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.",
      "I ve seen hatters before, she said to herself; the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in March.",
      "As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
      "Did you say pig, or fig?",
      "I said pig, replied Alice; and I wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.",
      "All right, said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
      "I ve often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice; but a grin without a cat!",
      "It s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.",
      "It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all!",
      "I almost wish I d gone to see the Hatter instead!",
      "CHAPTER VII.",
      "A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",
      "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as it s asleep, I suppose it doesn t mind.",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: No room!",
      "No room!",
      "they cried out when they saw Alice coming.",
      "There s _plenty_ of room!",
      "said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
      "Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.",
      "I don t see any wine, she remarked.",
      "There isn t any, said the March Hare.",
      "Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.",
      "It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.",
      "I didn t know it was _your_ table, said Alice; it s laid for a great many more than three.",
      "Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter.",
      "He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.",
      "You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity; it s very rude.",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_ was, Why is a raven like a writing-desk?",
      "Come, we shall have some fun now!",
      "I m glad they ve begun asking riddles.",
      "I believe I can guess that, she added aloud.",
      "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
      "said the March Hare.",
      "Exactly so, said Alice.",
      "Then you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.",
      "I do, Alice hastily replied; at least at least I mean what I say that s the same thing, you know.",
      "Not the same thing a bit!",
      "said the Hatter.",
      "You might just as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see !",
      "You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like !",
      "You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing as I sleep when I breathe !",
      "It _is_ the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn t much.",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence.",
      "What day of the month is it?",
      "he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said The fourth.",
      "Two days wrong!",
      "sighed the Hatter.",
      "I told you butter wouldn t suit the works!",
      "he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",
      "It was the _best_ butter, the March Hare meekly replied.",
      "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled: you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife.",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, It was the _best_ butter, you know.",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.",
      "What a funny watch!",
      "she remarked.",
      "It tells the day of the month, and doesn t tell what o clock it is!",
      "Why should it?",
      "muttered the Hatter.",
      "Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is?",
      "Of course not, Alice replied very readily: but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.",
      "Which is just the case with _mine_, said the Hatter.",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.",
      "The Hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.",
      "I don t quite understand you, she said, as politely as she could.",
      "The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.",
      "Have you guessed the riddle yet?",
      "the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.",
      "No, I give it up, Alice replied: what s the answer?",
      "I haven t the slightest idea, said the Hatter.",
      "Nor I, said the March Hare.",
      "Alice sighed wearily.",
      "I think you might do something better with the time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.",
      "If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldn t talk about wasting _it_.",
      "It s _him_.",
      "I don t know what you mean, said Alice.",
      "Of course you don t!",
      "the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.",
      "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!",
      "Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied: but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.",
      "Ah!",
      "that accounts for it, said the Hatter.",
      "He won t stand beating.",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he d do almost anything you liked with the clock.",
      "For instance, suppose it were nine o clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!",
      "Half-past one, time for dinner!",
      "( I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)",
      "That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully: but then I shouldn t be hungry for it, you know.",
      "Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter: but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.",
      "Is that the way _you_ manage?",
      "Alice asked.",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully.",
      "he replied.",
      "We quarrelled last March just before _he_ went mad, you know (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!",
      "How I wonder what you re at!",
      "You know the song, perhaps?",
      "I ve heard something like it, said Alice.",
      "It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way: Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.",
      "Twinkle, twinkle Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep _Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_ and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.",
      "Well, I d hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, He s murdering the time!",
      "Off with his head!",
      "How dreadfully savage!",
      "exclaimed Alice.",
      "And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he won t do a thing I ask!",
      "It s always six o clock now.",
      "A bright idea came into Alice s head.",
      "Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?",
      "she asked.",
      "Yes, that s it, said the Hatter with a sigh: it s always tea-time, and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles.",
      "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?",
      "Exactly so, said the Hatter: as the things get used up.",
      "But what happens when you come to the beginning again?",
      "Alice ventured to ask.",
      "Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning.",
      "I m getting tired of this.",
      "I vote the young lady tells us a story.",
      "I m afraid I don t know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.",
      "Then the Dormouse shall!",
      "they both cried.",
      "Wake up, Dormouse!",
      "And they pinched it on both sides at once.",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.",
      "I wasn t asleep, he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: I heard every word you fellows were saying.",
      "Tell us a story!",
      "Yes, please do!",
      "pleaded Alice.",
      "And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or you ll be asleep again before it s done.",
      "Once upon a time there were three little sisters, the Dormouse began in a great hurry; and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well What did they live on?",
      "said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.",
      "They lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.",
      "They couldn t have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked; they d have been ill.",
      "So they were, said the Dormouse; _very_ ill. Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: But why did they live at the bottom of a well?",
      "Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",
      "I ve had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I can t take more.",
      "You mean you can t take _less_, said the Hatter: it s very easy to take _more_ than nothing.",
      "Nobody asked _your_ opinion, said Alice.",
      "Who s making personal remarks now?",
      "the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.",
      "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, It was a treacle-well.",
      "There s no such thing!",
      "Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh!",
      "sh!",
      "and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, If you can t be civil, you d better finish the story for yourself.",
      "No, please go on!",
      "Alice said very humbly; I won t interrupt again.",
      "I dare say there may be _one_.",
      "One, indeed!",
      "said the Dormouse indignantly.",
      "However, he consented to go on.",
      "And so these three little sisters they were learning to draw, you know What did they draw?",
      "said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",
      "Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.",
      "I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter: let s all move one place on.",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.",
      "The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: But I don t understand.",
      "Where did they draw the treacle from?",
      "You can draw water out of a water-well, said the Hatter; so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well eh, stupid?",
      "But they were _in_ the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.",
      "Of course they were, said the Dormouse; well in.",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.",
      "They were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an M Why with an M?",
      "Why not?",
      "Alice was silent.",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?",
      "Really, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I don t think Then you shouldn t talk, said the Hatter.",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.",
      "At any rate I ll never go _there_ again!",
      "said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.",
      "It s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.",
      "That s very curious!",
      "But everything s curious today.",
      "I think I may as well go in at once.",
      "And in she went.",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.",
      "Now, I ll manage better this time, she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.",
      "Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_ she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.",
      "CHAPTER VIII.",
      "The Queen s Croquet-Ground A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.",
      "Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, Look out now, Five!",
      "Don t go splashing paint over me like that!",
      "I couldn t help it, said Five, in a sulky tone; Seven jogged my elbow.",
      "On which Seven looked up and said, That s right, Five!",
      "Always lay the blame on others!",
      "_You d_ better not talk!",
      "said Five.",
      "I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!",
      "What for?",
      "said the one who had spoken first.",
      "That s none of _your_ business, Two!",
      "said Seven.",
      "Yes, it _is_ his business!",
      "said Five, and I ll tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.",
      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.",
      "Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are painting those roses?",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.",
      "Two began in a low voice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.",
      "So you see, Miss, we re doing our best, afore she comes, to At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out The Queen!",
      "The Queen!",
      "and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.",
      "There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.",
      "After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.",
      "Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.",
      "Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; and besides, what would be the use of a procession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn t see it?",
      "So she stood still where she was, and waited.",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely Who is this?",
      "She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
      "Idiot!",
      "said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, What s your name, child?",
      "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, Why, they re only a pack of cards, after all.",
      "I needn t be afraid of them!",
      "And who are _these?_ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",
      "How should _I_ know?",
      "said Alice, surprised at her own courage.",
      "It s no business of _mine_.",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head!",
      "Off Nonsense!",
      "said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Consider, my dear: she is only a child!",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Turn them over!",
      "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
      "Get up!",
      "said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.",
      "Leave off that!",
      "screamed the Queen.",
      "You make me giddy.",
      "And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, What _have_ you been doing here?",
      "May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying _I_ see!",
      "said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.",
      "Off with their heads!",
      "and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.",
      "You shan t be beheaded!",
      "said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.",
      "The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.",
      "Are their heads off?",
      "shouted the Queen.",
      "Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!",
      "the soldiers shouted in reply.",
      "That s right!",
      "Can you play croquet?",
      "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.",
      "Yes!",
      "shouted Alice.",
      "Come on, then!",
      "roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.",
      "It s it s a very fine day!",
      "said a timid voice at her side.",
      "She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
      "Very, said Alice: where s the Duchess?",
      "Hush!",
      "said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.",
      "He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered She s under sentence of execution.",
      "Did you say What a pity!",
      "?",
      "the Rabbit asked.",
      "No, I didn t, said Alice: I don t think it s at all a pity.",
      "I said What for?",
      "She boxed the Queen s ears the Rabbit began.",
      "Alice gave a little scream of laughter.",
      "Oh, hush!",
      "the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.",
      "The Queen will hear you!",
      "You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said Get to your places!",
      "shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.",
      "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting Off with his head!",
      "or Off with her head!",
      "about once in a minute.",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of me?",
      "They re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there s any one left alive!",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself It s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.",
      "How are you getting on?",
      "said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.",
      "It s no use speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one of them.",
      "In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.",
      "The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
      "I don t think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there s the arch I ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and I should have croqueted the Queen s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!",
      "How do you like the Queen?",
      "said the Cat in a low voice.",
      "Not at all, said Alice: she s so extremely Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, likely to win, that it s hardly worth while finishing the game.",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.",
      "Who _are_ you talking to?",
      "said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat s head with great curiosity.",
      "It s a friend of mine a Cheshire Cat, said Alice: allow me to introduce it.",
      "I don t like the look of it at all, said the King: however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.",
      "I d rather not, the Cat remarked.",
      "Don t be impertinent, said the King, and don t look at me like that!",
      "He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
      "A cat may look at a king, said Alice.",
      "I ve read that in some book, but I don t remember where.",
      "Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear!",
      "I wish you would have this cat removed!",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.",
      "she said, without even looking round.",
      "I ll fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.",
      "She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.",
      "So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: but it doesn t matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.",
      "So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.",
      "The executioner s argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn t going to begin at _his_ time of life.",
      "The King s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense.",
      "The Queen s argument was, that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed, all round.",
      "(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)",
      "Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess: you d better ask _her_ about it.",
      "She s in prison, the Queen said to the executioner: fetch her here.",
      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
      "The Cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",
      "CHAPTER IX.",
      "The Mock Turtle s Story You can t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!",
      "said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice s, and they walked off together.",
      "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.",
      "When _I m_ a Duchess, she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), I won t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.",
      "Soup does very well without Maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.",
      "I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn t be so stingy about it, you know She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.",
      "You re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.",
      "I can t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.",
      "Perhaps it hasn t one, Alice ventured to remark.",
      "Tut, tut, child!",
      "said the Duchess.",
      "Everything s got a moral, if only you can find it.",
      "And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice s side as she spoke.",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.",
      "However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.",
      "The game s going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.",
      "Tis so, said the Duchess: and the moral of that is Oh, tis love, tis love, that makes the world go round!",
      "Somebody said, Alice whispered, that it s done by everybody minding their own business!",
      "Ah, well!",
      "It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice s shoulder as she added, and the moral of _that_ is Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.",
      "How fond she is of finding morals in things!",
      "Alice thought to herself.",
      "I dare say you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist, the Duchess said after a pause: the reason is, that I m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.",
      "Shall I try the experiment?",
      "He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.",
      "Very true, said the Duchess: flamingoes and mustard both bite.",
      "And the moral of that is Birds of a feather flock together.",
      "Only mustard isn t a bird, Alice remarked.",
      "Right, as usual, said the Duchess: what a clear way you have of putting things!",
      "It s a mineral, I _think_, said Alice.",
      "Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; there s a large mustard-mine near here.",
      "And the moral of that is The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.",
      "Oh, I know!",
      "exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, it s a vegetable.",
      "It doesn t look like one, but it is.",
      "I quite agree with you, said the Duchess; and the moral of that is Be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simply Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.",
      "I think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely, if I had it written down: but I can t quite follow it as you say it.",
      "That s nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.",
      "Pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said Alice.",
      "Oh, don t talk about trouble!",
      "I make you a present of everything I ve said as yet.",
      "A cheap sort of present!",
      "I m glad they don t give birthday presents like that!",
      "But she did not venture to say it out loud.",
      "Thinking again?",
      "the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.",
      "I ve a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.",
      "Just about as much right, said the Duchess, as pigs have to fly; and the m But here, to Alice s great surprise, the Duchess s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.",
      "Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.",
      "A fine day, your Majesty!",
      "the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
      "Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!",
      "Take your choice!",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
      "Let s go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives.",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting Off with his head!",
      "Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?",
      "No, said Alice.",
      "I don t even know what a Mock Turtle is.",
      "It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.",
      "I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.",
      "Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history, As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, You are all pardoned.",
      "Come, _that s_ a good thing!",
      "she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.",
      "(If you don t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)",
      "Up, lazy thing!",
      "said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.",
      "I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.",
      "Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.",
      "What fun!",
      "said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.",
      "What _is_ the fun?",
      "Why, _she_, said the Gryphon.",
      "It s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.",
      "Come on!",
      "Everybody says come on!",
      "here, thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",
      "She pitied him deeply.",
      "What is his sorrow?",
      "she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, It s all his fancy, that: he hasn t got no sorrow, you know.",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.",
      "This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your history, she do.",
      "I ll tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: sit down, both of you, and don t speak a word till I ve finished.",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.",
      "Alice thought to herself, I don t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn t begin.",
      "But she waited patiently.",
      "Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real Turtle.",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh!",
      "from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.",
      "Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.",
      "When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea.",
      "The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn t one?",
      "We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle angrily: really you are very dull!",
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.",
      "At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow!",
      "Don t be all day about it!",
      "and he went on in these words: Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn t believe it I never said I didn t!",
      "interrupted Alice.",
      "You did, said the Mock Turtle.",
      "Hold your tongue!",
      "added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.",
      "We had the best of educations in fact, we went to school every day _I ve_ been to a day-school, too, said Alice; you needn t be so proud as all that.",
      "With extras?",
      "asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.",
      "Yes, said Alice, we learned French and music.",
      "And washing?",
      "said the Mock Turtle.",
      "Certainly not!",
      "then yours wasn t a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.",
      "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, French, music, _and washing_ extra.",
      "You couldn t have wanted it much, said Alice; living at the bottom of the sea.",
      "I couldn t afford to learn it.",
      "said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.",
      "I only took the regular course.",
      "What was that?",
      "inquired Alice.",
      "Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, the Mock Turtle replied; and then the different branches of Arithmetic Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.",
      "I never heard of Uglification, Alice ventured to say.",
      "What is it?",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.",
      "What!",
      "Never heard of uglifying!",
      "it exclaimed.",
      "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
      "Yes, said Alice doubtfully: it means to make anything prettier.",
      "Well, then, the Gryphon went on, if you don t know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton.",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn?",
      "Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.",
      "What was _that_ like?",
      "Well, I can t show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said: I m too stiff.",
      "And the Gryphon never learnt it.",
      "Hadn t time, said the Gryphon: I went to the Classics master, though.",
      "He was an old crab, _he_ was.",
      "I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.",
      "So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.",
      "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
      "said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.",
      "Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle: nine the next, and so on.",
      "What a curious plan!",
      "That s the reason they re called lessons, the Gryphon remarked: because they lessen from day to day.",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.",
      "Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?",
      "Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle.",
      "And how did you manage on the twelfth?",
      "Alice went on eagerly.",
      "That s enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: tell her something about the games now.",
      "CHAPTER X.",
      "The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.",
      "He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.",
      "Same as if he had a bone in his throat, said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.",
      "At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again: You may not have lived much under the sea ( I haven t, said Alice) and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster (Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily, and said No, never ) so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!",
      "No, indeed, said Alice.",
      "What sort of a dance is it?",
      "Why, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along the sea-shore Two lines!",
      "cried the Mock Turtle.",
      "Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way _That_ generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon.",
      "you advance twice Each with a lobster as a partner!",
      "cried the Gryphon.",
      "Of course, the Mock Turtle said: advance twice, set to partners change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the Gryphon.",
      "Then, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw the The lobsters!",
      "shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.",
      "as far out to sea as you can Swim after them!",
      "screamed the Gryphon.",
      "Turn a somersault in the sea!",
      "cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.",
      "Change lobsters again!",
      "yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.",
      "Back to land again, and that s all the first figure, said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.",
      "It must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly.",
      "Would you like to see a little of it?",
      "Very much indeed, said Alice.",
      "Come, let s try the first figure!",
      "said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.",
      "We can do without lobsters, you know.",
      "Which shall sing?",
      "Oh, _you_ sing, said the Gryphon.",
      "I ve forgotten the words.",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly: Will you walk a little faster?",
      "said a whiting to a snail.",
      "There s a porpoise close behind us, and he s treading on my tail.",
      "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!",
      "They are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance?",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?",
      "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!",
      "But the snail replied Too far, too far!",
      "and gave a look askance Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",
      "What matters it how far we go?",
      "his scaly friend replied.",
      "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.",
      "The further off from England the nearer is to France Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.",
      "Thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!",
      "Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, they you ve seen them, of course?",
      "Yes, said Alice, I ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily.",
      "I don t know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if you ve seen them so often, of course you know what they re like.",
      "I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully.",
      "They have their tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs.",
      "You re wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle: crumbs would all wash off in the sea.",
      "But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.",
      "Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.",
      "The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance.",
      "So they got thrown out to sea.",
      "So they had to fall a long way.",
      "So they got their tails fast in their mouths.",
      "So they couldn t get them out again.",
      "That s all.",
      "Thank you, said Alice, it s very interesting.",
      "I never knew so much about a whiting before.",
      "I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon.",
      "Do you know why it s called a whiting?",
      "I never thought about it, said Alice.",
      "_It does the boots and shoes_, the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled.",
      "Does the boots and shoes!",
      "she repeated in a wondering tone.",
      "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?",
      "said the Gryphon.",
      "I mean, what makes them so shiny?",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.",
      "They re done with blacking, I believe.",
      "Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, are done with a whiting.",
      "Now you know.",
      "And what are they made of?",
      "Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
      "Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: any shrimp could have told you that.",
      "If I d been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, I d have said to the porpoise, Keep back, please: we don t want _you_ with us!",
      "They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said: no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.",
      "Wouldn t it really?",
      "said Alice in a tone of great surprise.",
      "Of course not, said the Mock Turtle: why, if a fish came to _me_, and told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise?",
      "Don t you mean purpose ?",
      "I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.",
      "And the Gryphon added Come, let s hear some of _your_ adventures.",
      "I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning, said Alice a little timidly: but it s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.",
      "Explain all that, said the Mock Turtle.",
      "The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: explanations take such a dreadful time.",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit.",
      "She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went on.",
      "Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating _You are old, Father William_, to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said That s very curious.",
      "It s all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.",
      "It all came different!",
      "the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.",
      "I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.",
      "Tell her to begin.",
      "He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.",
      "Stand up and repeat _Tis the voice of the sluggard_, said the Gryphon.",
      "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!",
      "thought Alice; I might as well be at school at once.",
      "However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed: Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.",
      "As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.",
      "[later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]",
      "That s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child, said the Gryphon.",
      "Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle; but it sounds uncommon nonsense.",
      "Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.",
      "I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.",
      "She can t explain it, said the Gryphon hastily.",
      "Go on with the next verse.",
      "But about his toes?",
      "the Mock Turtle persisted.",
      "How _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?",
      "It s the first position in dancing.",
      "Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",
      "Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently: it begins _I passed by his garden_.",
      "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice: I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.",
      "When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet ] What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle interrupted, if you don t explain it as you go on?",
      "It s by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!",
      "Yes, I think you d better leave off, said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.",
      "Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?",
      "the Gryphon went on.",
      "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?",
      "Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, Hm!",
      "No accounting for tastes!",
      "Sing her _Turtle Soup_, will you, old fellow?",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this: Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen!",
      "Who for such dainties would not stoop?",
      "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!",
      "Beau ootiful Soo oop!",
      "Soo oop of the e e evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",
      "Beautiful Soup!",
      "Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish?",
      "Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
      "Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
      "Soo oop of the e e evening, Beautiful, beauti FUL SOUP!",
      "Chorus again!",
      "cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of The trial s beginning!",
      "was heard in the distance.",
      "cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.",
      "What trial is it?",
      "Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered Come on!",
      "and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: Soo oop of the e e evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",
      "CHAPTER XI.",
      "Who Stole the Tarts?",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",
      "In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them I wish they d get the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!",
      "But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.",
      "That s the judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig.",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
      "And that s the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures, (she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) I suppose they are the jurors.",
      "She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.",
      "However, jury-men would have done just as well.",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.",
      "What are they doing?",
      "Alice whispered to the Gryphon.",
      "They can t have anything to put down yet, before the trial s begun.",
      "They re putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.",
      "Stupid things!",
      "Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the court!",
      "and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down stupid things!",
      "on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.",
      "A nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over!",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.",
      "This of course, Alice could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.",
      "She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
      "Herald, read the accusation!",
      "said the King.",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!",
      "Consider your verdict, the King said to the jury.",
      "Not yet, not yet!",
      "the Rabbit hastily interrupted.",
      "There s a great deal to come before that!",
      "Call the first witness, said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness!",
      "The first witness was the Hatter.",
      "He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",
      "I beg pardon, your Majesty, he began, for bringing these in: but I hadn t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.",
      "You ought to have finished, said the King.",
      "When did you begin?",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.",
      "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was, he said.",
      "Fifteenth, said the March Hare.",
      "Sixteenth, added the Dormouse.",
      "Write that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
      "Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter.",
      "It isn t mine, said the Hatter.",
      "_Stolen!_ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.",
      "I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation; I ve none of my own.",
      "I m a hatter.",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.",
      "Give your evidence, said the King; and don t be nervous, or I ll have you executed on the spot.",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.",
      "I wish you wouldn t squeeze so.",
      "said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.",
      "I can hardly breathe.",
      "I can t help it, said Alice very meekly: I m growing.",
      "You ve no right to grow _here_, said the Dormouse.",
      "Don t talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly: you know you re growing too.",
      "Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse: not in that ridiculous fashion.",
      "And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!",
      "on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.",
      "Give your evidence, the King repeated angrily, or I ll have you executed, whether you re nervous or not.",
      "I m a poor man, your Majesty, the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, and I hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea The twinkling of the _what?_ said the King.",
      "It _began_ with the tea, the Hatter replied.",
      "Of course twinkling begins with a T!",
      "said the King sharply.",
      "Do you take me for a dunce?",
      "Go on!",
      "I m a poor man, the Hatter went on, and most things twinkled after that only the March Hare said I didn t!",
      "the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
      "You did!",
      "I deny it!",
      "He denies it, said the King: leave out that part.",
      "Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.",
      "After that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more bread-and-butter But what did the Dormouse say?",
      "one of the jury asked.",
      "That I can t remember, said the Hatter.",
      "You _must_ remember, remarked the King, or I ll have you executed.",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.",
      "I m a poor man, your Majesty, he began.",
      "You re a _very_ poor _speaker_, said the King.",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.",
      "(As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.",
      "They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)",
      "I m glad I ve seen that done, thought Alice.",
      "I ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court, and I never understood what it meant till now.",
      "If that s all you know about it, you may stand down, continued the King.",
      "I can t go no lower, said the Hatter: I m on the floor, as it is.",
      "Then you may _sit_ down, the King replied.",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.",
      "Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!",
      "Now we shall get on better.",
      "I d rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
      "You may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.",
      "and just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.",
      "Call the next witness!",
      "The next witness was the Duchess s cook.",
      "She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",
      "Give your evidence, said the King.",
      "Shan t, said the cook.",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.",
      "Well, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What are tarts made of?",
      "Pepper, mostly, said the cook.",
      "Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.",
      "Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out.",
      "Behead that Dormouse!",
      "Turn that Dormouse out of court!",
      "Suppress him!",
      "Pinch him!",
      "Off with his whiskers!",
      "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.",
      "Never mind!",
      "said the King, with an air of great relief.",
      "Call the next witness.",
      "And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, my dear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness.",
      "It quite makes my forehead ache!",
      "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, for they haven t got much evidence _yet_, she said to herself.",
      "Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name Alice!",
      "CHAPTER XII.",
      "Alice s Evidence Here!",
      "cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
      "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!",
      "she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.",
      "The trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places _all_, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
      "She soon got it out again, and put it right; not that it signifies much, she said to herself; I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other.",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.",
      "What do you know about this business?",
      "the King said to Alice.",
      "Nothing, said Alice.",
      "Nothing _whatever?_ persisted the King.",
      "Nothing whatever, said Alice.",
      "That s very important, the King said, turning to the jury.",
      "They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: _Un_important, your Majesty means, of course, he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.",
      "_Un_important, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best.",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant.",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; but it doesn t matter a bit, she thought to herself.",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out Silence!",
      "and read out from his book, Rule Forty-two.",
      "_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.",
      "Everybody looked at Alice.",
      "_I m_ not a mile high, said Alice.",
      "You are, said the King.",
      "Nearly two miles high, added the Queen.",
      "Well, I shan t go, at any rate, said Alice: besides, that s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.",
      "It s the oldest rule in the book, said the King.",
      "Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice.",
      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.",
      "Consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",
      "There s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; this paper has just been picked up.",
      "What s in it?",
      "said the Queen.",
      "I haven t opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to to somebody.",
      "It must have been that, said the King, unless it was written to nobody, which isn t usual, you know.",
      "Who is it directed to?",
      "said one of the jurymen.",
      "It isn t directed at all, said the White Rabbit; in fact, there s nothing written on the _outside_.",
      "He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added It isn t a letter, after all: it s a set of verses.",
      "Are they in the prisoner s handwriting?",
      "asked another of the jurymen.",
      "No, they re not, said the White Rabbit, and that s the queerest thing about it.",
      "(The jury all looked puzzled.)",
      "He must have imitated somebody else s hand, said the King.",
      "(The jury all brightened up again.)",
      "Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didn t write it, and they can t prove I did: there s no name signed at the end.",
      "If you didn t sign it, said the King, that only makes the matter worse.",
      "You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you d have signed your name like an honest man.",
      "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.",
      "That _proves_ his guilt, said the Queen.",
      "It proves nothing of the sort!",
      "Why, you don t even know what they re about!",
      "Read them, said the King.",
      "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.",
      "Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?",
      "he asked.",
      "Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.",
      "These were the verses the White Rabbit read: They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.",
      "He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you?",
      "I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.",
      "If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.",
      "My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.",
      "Don t let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.",
      "That s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet, said the King, rubbing his hands; so now let the jury If any one of them can explain it, said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) I ll give him sixpence.",
      "_I_ don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it.",
      "The jury all wrote down on their slates, _She_ doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the paper.",
      "If there s no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn t try to find any.",
      "And yet I don t know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.",
      "_said I could not swim_ you can t swim, can you?",
      "he added, turning to the Knave.",
      "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
      "Do I look like it?",
      "he said.",
      "(Which he certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)",
      "All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: _We know it to be true_ that s the jury, of course _I gave her one, they gave him two_ why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know But, it goes on _they all returned from him to you_, said Alice.",
      "Why, there they are!",
      "said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.",
      "Nothing can be clearer than _that_.",
      "Then again _before she had this fit_ you never had fits, my dear, I think?",
      "he said to the Queen.",
      "Never!",
      "said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.",
      "(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)",
      "Then the words don t _fit_ you, said the King, looking round the court with a smile.",
      "There was a dead silence.",
      "It s a pun!",
      "the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.",
      "Sentence first verdict afterwards.",
      "Stuff and nonsense!",
      "said Alice loudly.",
      "The idea of having the sentence first!",
      "said the Queen, turning purple.",
      "I won t!",
      "Off with her head!",
      "the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.",
      "Nobody moved.",
      "Who cares for you?",
      "said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.)",
      "You re nothing but a pack of cards!",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
      "Wake up, Alice dear!",
      "said her sister; Why, what a long sleep you ve had!",
      "Oh, I ve had such a curious dream!",
      "said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It _was_ a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it s getting late.",
      "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into her eyes and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream.",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle s heavy sobs.",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.",

      "PART ONE Chapter 1 Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.",
      "Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys house.",
      "The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him.",
      "This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.",
      "Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys.",
      "The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days.",
      "The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.",
      "Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o clock in the morning, not in his wife s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study.",
      "He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.",
      "Yes, yes, how was it now?",
      "he thought, going over his dream.",
      "Now, how was it?",
      "To be sure!",
      "Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something American.",
      "Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America.",
      "Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang, _Il mio tesoro_ not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they were women, too, he remembered.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.",
      "Yes, it was nice, very nice.",
      "There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there s no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one s thoughts awake.",
      "And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco.",
      "And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.",
      "And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his brows.",
      "Ah, ah, ah!",
      "Oo!...",
      "he muttered, recalling everything that had happened.",
      "And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his own fault.",
      "Yes, she won t forgive me, and she can t forgive me.",
      "And the most awful thing about it is that it s all my fault all my fault, though I m not to blame.",
      "That s the point of the whole situation, he reflected.",
      "Oh, oh, oh!",
      "he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.",
      "Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.",
      "She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.",
      "What s this?",
      "this?",
      "she asked, pointing to the letter.",
      "And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his wife s words.",
      "There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.",
      "He did not succeed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by the discovery of his fault.",
      "Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even anything would have been better than what he did do his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology) utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.",
      "This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself.",
      "Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room.",
      "Since then she had refused to see her husband.",
      "It s that idiotic smile that s to blame for it all, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But what s to be done?",
      "What s to be done?",
      "he said to himself in despair, and found no answer.",
      "Chapter 2 Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.",
      "He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his conduct.",
      "He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself.",
      "All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.",
      "But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and himself.",
      "Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her.",
      "He had never clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact.",
      "He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view.",
      "It had turned out quite the other way.",
      "Oh, it s awful!",
      "oh dear, oh dear!",
      "awful!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done.",
      "And how well things were going up till now!",
      "how well we got on!",
      "She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked.",
      "It s true it s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.",
      "That s bad!",
      "There s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one s governess.",
      "But what a governess!",
      "(He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle.",
      "Roland and her smile.)",
      "But after all, while she was in the house, I kept myself in hand.",
      "And the worst of it all is that she s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so!",
      "Oh, oh!",
      "But what, what is to be done?",
      "There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all questions, even the most complex and insoluble.",
      "That answer is: one must live in the needs of the day that is, forget oneself.",
      "To forget himself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life.",
      "Then we shall see, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily.",
      "He pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly.",
      "It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a telegram.",
      "Matvey was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.",
      "Are there any papers from the office?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.",
      "On the table, replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, They ve sent from the carriage-jobbers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the looking-glass.",
      "In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes asked: Why do you tell me that?",
      "don t you know?",
      "Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.",
      "I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing, he said.",
      "He had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself.",
      "Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened.",
      "Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow, he said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers.",
      "Thank God!",
      "said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his master, realized the significance of this arrival that is, that Anna Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife.",
      "Alone, or with her husband?",
      "inquired Matvey.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his upper lip, and he raised one finger.",
      "Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.",
      "Alone.",
      "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
      "Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna?",
      "Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.",
      "Yes, inform her.",
      "Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do what she tells you.",
      "You want to try it on, Matvey understood, but he only said, Yes, sir.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with the telegram in his hand.",
      "The barber had gone.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away.",
      "Let him do that is you as he likes, he said, laughing only with his eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his head on one side.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute.",
      "Then a good-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face.",
      "Eh, Matvey?",
      "he said, shaking his head.",
      "It s all right, sir; she will come round, said Matvey.",
      "Come round?",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "Do you think so?",
      "Who s there?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the rustle of a woman s dress at the door.",
      "It s I, said a firm, pleasant, woman s voice, and the stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the doorway.",
      "Well, what is it, Matrona?",
      "queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to her at the door.",
      "Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house (even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna s chief ally) was on his side.",
      "Well, what now?",
      "he asked disconsolately.",
      "Go to her, sir; own your fault again.",
      "Maybe God will aid you.",
      "She is suffering so, it s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house is topsy-turvy.",
      "You must have pity, sir, on the children.",
      "Beg her forgiveness, sir.",
      "There s no help for it!",
      "One must take the consequences....",
      "But she won t see me.",
      "You do your part.",
      "God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.",
      "Come, that ll do, you can go, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing suddenly.",
      "Well now, do dress me.",
      "He turned to Matvey and threw off his dressing-gown decisively.",
      "Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse s collar, and, blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the well-groomed body of his master.",
      "Chapter 3 When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his cigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and papers from the office.",
      "He read the letters.",
      "One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a forest on his wife s property.",
      "To sell this forest was absolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject could not be discussed.",
      "The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife.",
      "And the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him.",
      "When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his coffee.",
      "As he sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but one advocating the views held by the majority.",
      "And in spite of the fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for him, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the majority changed them or, more strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being worn.",
      "And for him, living in a certain society owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat.",
      "If there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life.",
      "The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money.",
      "The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature.",
      "The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world.",
      "And with all this, Stepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown the first founder of his family the monkey.",
      "And so Liberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch s, and he liked his newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his brain.",
      "He read the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, in our opinion the danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress, etc., etc.",
      "He read another article, too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry.",
      "With his characteristic quickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain satisfaction.",
      "But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona Philimonovna s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household.",
      "He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification.",
      "Having finished the paper, a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.",
      "But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew thoughtful.",
      "Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside the door.",
      "They were carrying something, and dropped it.",
      "I told you not to sit passengers on the roof, said the little girl in English; there, pick them up!",
      "Everything s in confusion, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch; there are the children running about by themselves.",
      "And going to the door, he called them.",
      "They threw down the box, that represented a train, and came in to their father.",
      "The little girl, her father s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him, and hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers.",
      "At last the little girl kissed his face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.",
      "How is mamma?",
      "he asked, passing his hand over his daughter s smooth, soft little neck.",
      "Good morning, he said, smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him.",
      "He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father s chilly smile.",
      "Mamma?",
      "She is up, answered the girl.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed.",
      "That means that she s not slept again all night, he thought.",
      "Well, is she cheerful?",
      "The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father must be aware of this, and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly.",
      "And she blushed for her father.",
      "He at once perceived it, and blushed too.",
      "I don t know, she said.",
      "She did not say we must do our lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma s. Well, go, Tanya, my darling.",
      "Oh, wait a minute, though, he said, still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.",
      "He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little box of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.",
      "For Grisha?",
      "said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.",
      "Yes, yes.",
      "And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her on the roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.",
      "The carriage is ready, said Matvey; but there s someone to see you with a petition.",
      "Been here long?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Half an hour.",
      "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
      "One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least, said Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry.",
      "Well, show the person up at once, said Oblonsky, frowning with vexation.",
      "The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a request impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he generally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her, in his large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who might be of use to her.",
      "Having got rid of the staff captain s widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything.",
      "It appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife.",
      "Ah, yes!",
      "He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a harassed expression.",
      "To go, or not to go!",
      "he said to himself; and an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible, because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love, or to make him an old man, not susceptible to love.",
      "Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature.",
      "It must be some time, though: it can t go on like this, he said, trying to give himself courage.",
      "He squared his chest, took out a cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl ashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and opened the other door into his wife s bedroom.",
      "Chapter 4 Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from the thinness of her face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which she was taking something.",
      "Hearing her husband s steps, she stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression.",
      "She felt she was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview.",
      "She was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the children s things and her own, so as to take them to her mother s and again she could not bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying to herself, that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some step to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her.",
      "She still continued to tell herself that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and loving him.",
      "Besides this, she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly, they would be still worse off where she was going with them all.",
      "As it was, even in the course of these three days, the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before.",
      "She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going.",
      "Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her.",
      "But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.",
      "Dolly!",
      "he said in a subdued and timid voice.",
      "He bent his head towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health.",
      "In a rapid glance she scanned his figure that beamed with health and freshness.",
      "Yes, he is happy and content!",
      "she thought; while I.... And that disgusting good nature, which everyone likes him for and praises I hate that good nature of his, she thought.",
      "Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek contracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.",
      "What do you want?",
      "she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.",
      "he repeated, with a quiver in his voice.",
      "Anna is coming today.",
      "Well, what is that to me?",
      "I can t see her!",
      "she cried.",
      "But you must, really, Dolly.... Go away, go away, go away!",
      "she shrieked, not looking at him, as though this shriek were called up by physical pain.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could hope that she would _come round_, as Matvey expressed it, and could quietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat, and his eyes began to shine with tears.",
      "My God!",
      "what have I done?",
      "For God s sake!...",
      "You know....",
      "He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.",
      "She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.",
      "Dolly, what can I say?...",
      "One thing: forgive....",
      "Remember, cannot nine years of my life atone for an instant.... She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it were beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently.",
      "instant of passion?",
      "he said, and would have gone on, but at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and again the muscles of her right cheek worked.",
      "Go away, go out of the room!",
      "she shrieked still more shrilly, and don t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.",
      "She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to support herself.",
      "His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were swimming with tears.",
      "he said, sobbing now; for mercy s sake, think of the children; they are not to blame!",
      "I am to blame, and punish me, make me expiate my fault.",
      "Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything!",
      "I am to blame, no words can express how much I am to blame!",
      "But, Dolly, forgive me!",
      "She sat down.",
      "He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was unutterably sorry for her.",
      "She tried several times to begin to speak, but could not.",
      "He waited.",
      "You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember them, and know that this means their ruin, she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last few days.",
      "She had called him Stiva, and he glanced at her with gratitude, and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.",
      "I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in the world to save them, but I don t myself know how to save them.",
      "By taking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious father yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened, can we live together?",
      "Is that possible?",
      "Tell me, eh, is it possible?",
      "she repeated, raising her voice, after my husband, the father of my children, enters into a love affair with his own children s governess?",
      "But what could I do?",
      "what could I do?",
      "he kept saying in a pitiful voice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower and lower.",
      "You are loathsome to me, repulsive!",
      "she shrieked, getting more and more heated.",
      "Your tears mean nothing!",
      "You have never loved me; you have neither heart nor honorable feeling!",
      "You are hateful to me, disgusting, a stranger yes, a complete stranger!",
      "With pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself _stranger_.",
      "He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him.",
      "He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her.",
      "She saw in him sympathy for her, but not love.",
      "No, she hates me.",
      "She will not forgive me, he thought.",
      "It is awful!",
      "he said.",
      "At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had fallen down.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly softened.",
      "She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though she did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up rapidly, she moved towards the door.",
      "Well, she loves my child, he thought, noticing the change of her face at the child s cry, my child: how can she hate me?",
      "Dolly, one word more, he said, following her.",
      "If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children!",
      "They may all know you are a scoundrel!",
      "I am going away at once, and you may live here with your mistress!",
      "And she went out, slamming the door.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread walked out of the room.",
      "Matvey says she will come round; but how?",
      "I don t see the least chance of it.",
      "Ah, oh, how horrible it is!",
      "And how vulgarly she shouted, he said to himself, remembering her shriek and the words scoundrel and mistress.",
      "And very likely the maids were listening!",
      "Horribly vulgar!",
      "horrible!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few seconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the room.",
      "It was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding up the clock.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this punctual, bald watchmaker, that the German was wound up for a whole lifetime himself, to wind up watches, and he smiled.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was fond of a joke: And maybe she will come round!",
      "That s a good expression, _come round,_ he thought.",
      "I must repeat that.",
      "Matvey!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting room for Anna Arkadyevna, he said to Matvey when he came in.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.",
      "You won t dine at home?",
      "said Matvey, seeing him off.",
      "That s as it happens.",
      "But here s for the housekeeping, he said, taking ten roubles from his pocketbook.",
      "That ll be enough.",
      "Enough or not enough, we must make it do, said Matvey, slamming the carriage door and stepping back onto the steps.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to her bedroom.",
      "It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it.",
      "Even now, in the short time she had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona Philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her, which did not admit of delay, and which only she could answer: What were the children to put on for their walk?",
      "Should they have any milk?",
      "Should not a new cook be sent for?",
      "Ah, let me alone, let me alone!",
      "she said, and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to her husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that slipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her memory all the conversation.",
      "He has gone!",
      "But has he broken it off with her?",
      "she thought.",
      "Can it be he sees her?",
      "Why didn t I ask him!",
      "No, no, reconciliation is impossible.",
      "Even if we remain in the same house, we are strangers strangers forever!",
      "She repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her.",
      "And how I loved him!",
      "my God, how I loved him!...",
      "How I loved him!",
      "And now don t I love him?",
      "Don t I love him more than before?",
      "The most horrible thing is, she began, but did not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her head in at the door.",
      "Let us send for my brother, she said; he can get a dinner anyway, or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like yesterday.",
      "Very well, I will come directly and see about it.",
      "But did you send for some new milk?",
      "And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned her grief in them for a time.",
      "Chapter 5 Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his excellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and therefore was one of the lowest in his class.",
      "But in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the service, and his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at Moscow.",
      "This post he had received through his sister Anna s husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged.",
      "But if Karenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth, then through a hundred other personages brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and aunts Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other similar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife s considerable property, were in an embarrassed condition.",
      "Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He was born in the midst of those who had been and are the powerful ones of this world.",
      "One-third of the men in the government, the older men, had been friends of his father s, and had known him in petticoats; another third were his intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.",
      "Consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were all his friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and Oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post.",
      "He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be quarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did.",
      "It would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required, especially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable honesty.",
      "In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him.",
      "Aha!",
      "Stiva!",
      "Oblonsky!",
      "Here he is!",
      "was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him.",
      "Even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the next, everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again.",
      "After filling for three years the post of president of one of the government boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect, as well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and superiors, and all who had had business with him.",
      "The principal qualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme indulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly the most important point his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged, in consequence of which he was never carried away, and never made mistakes.",
      "On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private room, put on his uniform, and went into the boardroom.",
      "The clerks and copyists all rose, greeting him with good-humored deference.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch moved quickly, as ever, to his place, shook hands with his colleagues, and sat down.",
      "He made a joke or two, and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum, and began work.",
      "No one knew better than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between freedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable conduct of business.",
      "A secretary, with the good-humored deference common to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch s office, came up with papers, and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "We have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of Penza.",
      "Here, would you care?...",
      "You ve got them at last?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying his finger on the paper.",
      "Now, gentlemen.... And the sitting of the board began.",
      "If they knew, he thought, bending his head with a significant air as he listened to the report, what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago.",
      "And his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report.",
      "Till two o clock the sitting would go on without a break, and at two o clock there would be an interval and luncheon.",
      "It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom suddenly opened and someone came in.",
      "All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the Tsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the door; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the intruder, and closed the glass door after him.",
      "When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and stretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room.",
      "Two of the members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and the _Kammerjunker_ Grinevitch, went in with him.",
      "We shall have time to finish after lunch, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "To be sure we shall!",
      "said Nikitin.",
      "A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be, said Grinevitch of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch s words, giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and made him no reply.",
      "Who was that came in?",
      "he asked the doorkeeper.",
      "Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back was turned.",
      "He was asking for you.",
      "I told him: when the members come out, then.... Where is he?",
      "Maybe he s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway.",
      "That is he, said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built, broad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his sheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase.",
      "One of the members going down a lean official with a portfolio stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of the stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs.",
      "His good-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.",
      "Why, it s actually you, Levin, at last!",
      "he said with a friendly mocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached.",
      "How is it you have deigned to look me up in this den?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and not content with shaking hands, he kissed his friend.",
      "Have you been here long?",
      "I have just come, and very much wanted to see you, said Levin, looking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.",
      "Well, let s go into my room, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his friend s sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his arm, he drew him along, as though guiding him through dangers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names: old men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and adjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky, something in common.",
      "He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with everyone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums, as he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his subordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to diminish the disagreeable impression made on them.",
      "Levin was not a disreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.",
      "Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne.",
      "Levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth.",
      "They were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth.",
      "But in spite of this, each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the other s career, in his heart despised it.",
      "It seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life, and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm.",
      "Oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of Levin.",
      "How often he had seen him come up to Moscow from the country where he was doing something, but what precisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he took no interest in the matter.",
      "Levin arrived in Moscow always excited and in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of things.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it.",
      "In the same way Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend, and his official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling.",
      "But the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as everyone did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin laughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.",
      "We have long been expecting you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into his room and letting Levin s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over.",
      "I am very, very glad to see you, he went on.",
      "Well, how are you?",
      "Eh?",
      "When did you come?",
      "Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky s two companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought.",
      "Oblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.",
      "Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you, he said.",
      "My colleagues: Philip Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch and turning to Levin a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast who lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman, and my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev.",
      "Delighted, said the veteran.",
      "I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, said Grinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.",
      "Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.",
      "Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well known to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not as Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.",
      "No, I am no longer a district councilor.",
      "I have quarreled with them all, and don t go to the meetings any more, he said, turning to Oblonsky.",
      "You ve been quick about it!",
      "said Oblonsky with a smile.",
      "But how?",
      "why?",
      "It s a long story.",
      "I will tell you some time, said Levin, but he began telling him at once.",
      "Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced that nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could be, he began, as though someone had just insulted him.",
      "On one side it s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the other side (he stammered) it s a means for the coterie of the district to make money.",
      "Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice, now they have the district council not in the form of bribes, but in the form of unearned salary, he said, as hotly as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion.",
      "You re in a new phase again, I see a conservative, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "However, we can go into that later.",
      "Yes, later.",
      "But I wanted to see you, said Levin, looking with hatred at Grinevitch s hand.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.",
      "How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?",
      "he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor.",
      "Ah!",
      "I see: a new phase.",
      "Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being themselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more, almost to the point of tears.",
      "And it was so strange to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight, that Oblonsky left off looking at him.",
      "Oh, where shall we meet?",
      "You know I want very much to talk to you, said Levin.",
      "Oblonsky seemed to ponder.",
      "I ll tell you what: let s go to Gurin s to lunch, and there we can talk.",
      "I am free till three.",
      "No, answered Levin, after an instant s thought, I have got to go on somewhere else.",
      "All right, then, let s dine together.",
      "Dine together?",
      "But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk afterwards.",
      "Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we ll gossip after dinner.",
      "Well, it s this, said Levin; but it s of no importance, though.",
      "His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness.",
      "What are the Shtcherbatskys doing?",
      "Everything as it used to be?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his sister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes sparkled merrily.",
      "You said a few words, but I can t answer in a few words, because....",
      "Excuse me a minute.... A secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with some papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain some objection.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him out, laid his hand genially on the secretary s sleeve.",
      "No, you do as I told you, he said, softening his words with a smile, and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers, and said: So do it that way, if you please, Zahar Nikititch.",
      "The secretary retired in confusion.",
      "During the consultation with the secretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment.",
      "He was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a look of ironical attention.",
      "I don t understand it, I don t understand it, he said.",
      "What don t you understand?",
      "said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as ever, and picking up a cigarette.",
      "He expected some queer outburst from Levin.",
      "I don t understand what you are doing, said Levin, shrugging his shoulders.",
      "How can you do it seriously?",
      "Why not?",
      "Why, because there s nothing in it.",
      "You think so, but we re overwhelmed with work.",
      "On paper.",
      "But, there, you ve a gift for it, added Levin.",
      "That s to say, you think there s a lack of something in me?",
      "Perhaps so, said Levin.",
      "But all the same I admire your grandeur, and am proud that I ve a friend in such a great person.",
      "You ve not answered my question, though, he went on, with a desperate effort looking Oblonsky straight in the face.",
      "Oh, that s all very well.",
      "You wait a bit, and you ll come to this yourself.",
      "It s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of twelve; still you ll be one of us one day.",
      "Yes, as to your question, there is no change, but it s a pity you ve been away so long.",
      "Oh, why so?",
      "Levin queried, panic-stricken.",
      "Oh, nothing, responded Oblonsky.",
      "We ll talk it over.",
      "But what s brought you up to town?",
      "Oh, we ll talk about that, too, later on, said Levin, reddening again up to his ears.",
      "All right.",
      "I see, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I should ask you to come to us, you know, but my wife s not quite the thing.",
      "But I tell you what; if you want to see them, they re sure now to be at the Zoological Gardens from four to five.",
      "Kitty skates.",
      "You drive along there, and I ll come and fetch you, and we ll go and dine somewhere together.",
      "Capital.",
      "So good-bye till then.",
      "Now mind, you ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.",
      "No, truly!",
      "And Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky s colleagues.",
      "That gentleman must be a man of great energy, said Grinevitch, when Levin had gone away.",
      "Yes, my dear boy, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his head, he s a lucky fellow!",
      "Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district; everything before him; and what youth and vigor!",
      "Not like some of us.",
      "You have a great deal to complain of, haven t you, Stepan Arkadyevitch?",
      "Ah, yes, I m in a poor way, a bad way, said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh.",
      "Chapter 6 When Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed, and was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer, I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer, though that was precisely what he had come for.",
      "The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.",
      "This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin s student days.",
      "He had both prepared for the university with the young Prince Shtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the same time with him.",
      "In those days Levin used often to be in the Shtcherbatskys house, and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky household.",
      "Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the family, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine half of the household.",
      "Levin did not remember his own mother, and his only sister was older than he was, so that it was in the Shtcherbatskys house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother.",
      "All the members of that family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection.",
      "Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother s room above, where the students used to work; why they were visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.",
      "In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky.",
      "Then he began being in love with the second.",
      "He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of the sisters, only he could not quite make out which.",
      "But Natalia, too, had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat Lvov.",
      "Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.",
      "Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and Levin s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky, became less intimate.",
      "But when early in the winter of this year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw the Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love.",
      "One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match.",
      "But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her.",
      "After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing Kitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet her, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the country.",
      "Levin s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him.",
      "In her family s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in society, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two, were already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director of a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky.",
      "But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.",
      "The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way striking person.",
      "Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the past the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his friendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.",
      "An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man.",
      "He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.",
      "But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant s rest; that he could not live without deciding the question, would she or would she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected.",
      "And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to make an offer, and get married if he were accepted.",
      "Or ... he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected.",
      "Chapter 7 On arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house of his elder half-brother, Koznishev.",
      "After changing his clothes he went down to his brother s study, intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother was not alone.",
      "With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy, who had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question.",
      "The professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists.",
      "Sergey Koznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after reading the professor s last article, he had written him a letter stating his objections.",
      "He accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists.",
      "And the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out.",
      "The point in discussion was the question then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between psychological and physiological phenomena in man?",
      "and if so, where?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went on with the conversation.",
      "A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him.",
      "Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go, but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion.",
      "Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of the first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural science student at the university.",
      "But he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action, biology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his mind.",
      "As he listened to his brother s argument with the professor, he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about.",
      "I cannot admit it, said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.",
      "I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions.",
      "The most fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea.",
      "Yes, but they Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations.",
      "Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.",
      "I maintain the contrary, began Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor.",
      "According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?",
      "he queried.",
      "The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the interruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a bargeman than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey Ivanovitch, as though to ask: What s one to say to him?",
      "But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said: That question we have no right to answer as yet.",
      "We have not the requisite data, chimed in the professor, and he went back to his argument.",
      "No, he said; I would point out the fact that if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation, then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions.",
      "Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.",
      "Chapter 8 When the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.",
      "Delighted that you ve come.",
      "For some time, is it?",
      "How s your farming getting on?",
      "Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and only put the question in deference to him, and so he only told him about the sale of his wheat and money matters.",
      "Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so.",
      "But after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the professor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their mother s property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both their shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to talk to him of his intention of marrying.",
      "He felt that his brother would not look at it as he would have wished him to.",
      "Well, how is your district council doing?",
      "asked Sergey Ivanovitch, who was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great importance to them.",
      "I really don t know.",
      "What!",
      "Why, surely you re a member of the board?",
      "No, I m not a member now; I ve resigned, answered Levin, and I no longer attend the meetings.",
      "What a pity!",
      "commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.",
      "Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings in his district.",
      "That s how it always is!",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.",
      "We Russians are always like that.",
      "Perhaps it s our strong point, really, the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues.",
      "All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to any other European people why, the Germans or the English would have worked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into ridicule.",
      "But how can it be helped?",
      "said Levin penitently.",
      "It was my last effort.",
      "And I did try with all my soul.",
      "I can t. I m no good at it.",
      "It s not that you re no good at it, said Sergey Ivanovitch; it is that you don t look at it as you should.",
      "Perhaps not, Levin answered dejectedly.",
      "Oh!",
      "do you know brother Nikolay s turned up again?",
      "This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and half-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest and lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers.",
      "What did you say?",
      "Levin cried with horror.",
      "How do you know?",
      "Prokofy saw him in the street.",
      "Here in Moscow?",
      "Where is he?",
      "Do you know?",
      "Levin got up from his chair, as though on the point of starting off at once.",
      "I am sorry I told you, said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head at his younger brother s excitement.",
      "I sent to find out where he is living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid.",
      "This is the answer he sent me.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed it to his brother.",
      "Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting: I humbly beg you to leave me in peace.",
      "That s the only favor I ask of my gracious brothers.",
      "Nikolay Levin.",
      "Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be base to do so.",
      "He obviously wants to offend me, pursued Sergey Ivanovitch; but he cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist him, but I know it s impossible to do that.",
      "Yes, yes, repeated Levin.",
      "I understand and appreciate your attitude to him; but I shall go and see him.",
      "If you want to, do; but I shouldn t advise it, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say you would do better not to go.",
      "You can t do him any good; still, do as you please.",
      "Very likely I can t do any good, but I feel especially at such a moment but that s another thing I feel I could not be at peace.",
      "Well, that I don t understand, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "One thing I do understand, he added; it s a lesson in humility.",
      "I have come to look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he did.... Oh, it s awful, awful!",
      "repeated Levin.",
      "After obtaining his brother s address from Sergey Ivanovitch s footman, Levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening.",
      "The first thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to Moscow for.",
      "From his brother s Levin went to Oblonsky s office, and on getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place where he had been told he might find Kitty.",
      "Chapter 9 At four o clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of a hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would certainly find her there, as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys carriage at the entrance.",
      "It was a bright, frosty day.",
      "Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and policemen were standing in the approach.",
      "Crowds of well-dressed people, with hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the well-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the Russian style.",
      "The old curly birches of the gardens, all their twigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments.",
      "He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to himself You mustn t be excited, you must be calm.",
      "What s the matter with you?",
      "Be quiet, stupid, he conjured his heart.",
      "And the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found himself.",
      "An acquaintance met him and called him by his name, but Levin did not even recognize him.",
      "He went towards the mounds, whence came the clank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up, the rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices.",
      "He walked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes, and at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.",
      "He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his heart.",
      "She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground.",
      "There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude.",
      "But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles.",
      "Everything was made bright by her.",
      "She was the smile that shed light on all round her.",
      "Is it possible I can go over there on the ice, go up to her?",
      "he thought.",
      "The place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment when he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror.",
      "He had to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come there to skate.",
      "He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without looking.",
      "On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all acquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice.",
      "There were crack skaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs with timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with hygienic motives.",
      "They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here, near her.",
      "All the skaters, it seemed, with perfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke to her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather.",
      "Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty s cousin, in a short jacket and tight trousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on.",
      "Seeing Levin, he shouted to him: Ah, the first skater in Russia!",
      "First-rate ice do put your skates on.",
      "I haven t got my skates, Levin answered, marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her, though he did not look at her.",
      "He felt as though the sun were coming near him.",
      "She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in their high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him.",
      "A boy in Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the ground, overtook her.",
      "She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for emergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him, and at her own fears.",
      "When she had got round the turn, she gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to Shtcherbatsky.",
      "Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin.",
      "She was more splendid than he had imagined her.",
      "When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness and good humor.",
      "The childishness of her expression, together with the delicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he fully realized.",
      "But what always struck him in her as something unlooked for, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and above all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted world, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered himself in some days of his early childhood.",
      "she said, giving him her hand.",
      "Thank you, she added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff.",
      "I?",
      "I ve not long ... yesterday ...",
      "I mean today ...",
      "I arrived, answered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question.",
      "I was meaning to come and see you, he said; and then, recollecting with what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed.",
      "I didn t know you could skate, and skate so well.",
      "She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion.",
      "Your praise is worth having.",
      "The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters, she said, with her little black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.",
      "Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.",
      "You do everything with passion, I think, she said smiling.",
      "I should so like to see how you skate.",
      "Put on skates, and let us skate together.",
      "Skate together!",
      "Can that be possible?",
      "thought Levin, gazing at her.",
      "I ll put them on directly, he said.",
      "And he went off to get skates.",
      "It s a long while since we ve seen you here, sir, said the attendant, supporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate.",
      "Except you, there s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters.",
      "Will that be all right?",
      "said he, tightening the strap.",
      "Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please, answered Levin, with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.",
      "Yes, he thought, this now is life, this is happiness!",
      "_Together,_ she said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now?",
      "But that s just why I m afraid to speak because I m happy now, happy in hope, anyway.... And then?...",
      "But I must!",
      "I must!",
      "Away with weakness!",
      "Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the rough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning his course.",
      "He approached with timidity, but again her smile reassured him.",
      "She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and faster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand.",
      "With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you, she said to him.",
      "And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me, he said, but was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed.",
      "And indeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like the sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and Levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the working of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.",
      "Is there anything troubling you?",
      "though I ve no right to ask such a question, he added hurriedly.",
      "Oh, why so?...",
      "No, I have nothing to trouble me, she responded coldly; and she added immediately: You haven t seen Mlle.",
      "Linon, have you?",
      "Not yet.",
      "Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.",
      "What s wrong?",
      "I have offended her.",
      "Lord help me!",
      "thought Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting on a bench.",
      "Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted him as an old friend.",
      "Yes, you see we re growing up, she said to him, glancing towards Kitty, and growing old.",
      "_Tiny bear_ has grown big now!",
      "pursued the Frenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English nursery tale.",
      "Do you remember that s what you used to call them?",
      "He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now, and was fond of it.",
      "Now, go and skate, go and skate.",
      "Our Kitty has learned to skate nicely, hasn t she?",
      "When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin fancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate composure.",
      "And he felt depressed.",
      "After talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.",
      "Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren t you?",
      "she said.",
      "No, I m not dull, I am very busy, he said, feeling that she was holding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the force to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the winter.",
      "Are you going to stay in town long?",
      "Kitty questioned him.",
      "I don t know, he answered, not thinking of what he was saying.",
      "The thought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything came into his mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.",
      "How is it you don t know?",
      "I don t know.",
      "It depends upon you, he said, and was immediately horror-stricken at his own words.",
      "Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want to hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and hurriedly skated away from him.",
      "She skated up to Mlle.",
      "Linon, said something to her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates.",
      "what have I done!",
      "Merciful God!",
      "help me, guide me, said Levin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of violent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.",
      "At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the day, came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in his mouth.",
      "Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates, crashing and bounding up and down.",
      "He flew down, and without even changing the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.",
      "Ah, that s a new trick!",
      "said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top to do this new trick.",
      "Don t break your neck!",
      "it needs practice!",
      "Nikolay Shtcherbatsky shouted after him.",
      "Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and dashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands.",
      "On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with his hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.",
      "How splendid, how nice he is!",
      "Kitty was thinking at that time, as she came out of the pavilion with Mlle.",
      "Linon, and looked towards him with a smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother.",
      "And can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
      "They talk of flirtation.",
      "I know it s not he that I love; but still I am happy with him, and he s so jolly.",
      "Only, why did he say that?...",
      "she mused.",
      "Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the steps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered a minute.",
      "He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens.",
      "Delighted to see you, said Princess Shtcherbatskaya.",
      "On Thursdays we are home, as always.",
      "Today, then?",
      "We shall be pleased to see you, the princess said stiffly.",
      "This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her mother s coldness.",
      "She turned her head, and with a smile said: Good-bye till this evening.",
      "At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with beaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.",
      "But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and crestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly s health.",
      "After a little subdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out his chest again, and put his arm in Levin s. Well, shall we set off?",
      "he asked.",
      "I ve been thinking about you all this time, and I m very, very glad you ve come, he said, looking him in the face with a significant air.",
      "Yes, come along, answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying, Good-bye till this evening, and seeing the smile with which it was said.",
      "To the England or the Hermitage?",
      "I don t mind which.",
      "All right, then, the England, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and consequently considered it mean to avoid it.",
      "Have you got a sledge?",
      "That s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.",
      "The friends hardly spoke all the way.",
      "Levin was wondering what that change in Kitty s expression had meant, and alternately assuring himself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly that his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words, Good-bye till this evening.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner.",
      "You like turbot, don t you?",
      "he said to Levin as they were arriving.",
      "responded Levin.",
      "Turbot?",
      "Yes, I m _awfully_ fond of turbot.",
      "Chapter 10 When Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained radiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining-room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were clustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins.",
      "Bowing to right and left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting acquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer of fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in ribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing that even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter.",
      "Levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a loathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair, _poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_.",
      "He made haste to move away from her, as from a dirty place.",
      "His whole soul was filled with memories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes.",
      "This way, your excellency, please.",
      "Your excellency won t be disturbed here, said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind.",
      "Walk in, your excellency, he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan Arkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.",
      "Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze chandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up velvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.",
      "If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free directly; Prince Golistin with a lady.",
      "Fresh oysters have come in.",
      "oysters.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.",
      "How if we were to change our program, Levin?",
      "he said, keeping his finger on the bill of fare.",
      "And his face expressed serious hesitation.",
      "Are the oysters good?",
      "Mind now.",
      "They re Flensburg, your excellency.",
      "We ve no Ostend.",
      "Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?",
      "Only arrived yesterday.",
      "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the whole program?",
      "It s all the same to me.",
      "I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything; but of course there s nothing like that here.",
      "_Porridge la Russe,_ your honor would like?",
      "said the Tatar, bending down to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.",
      "No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good.",
      "I ve been skating, and I m hungry.",
      "And don t imagine, he added, detecting a look of dissatisfaction on Oblonsky s face, that I shan t appreciate your choice.",
      "I am fond of good things.",
      "I should hope so!",
      "After all, it s one of the pleasures of life, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, then, my friend, you give us two or better say three dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables.... _Printani re,_ prompted the Tatar.",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names of the dishes.",
      "With vegetables in it, you know.",
      "Then turbot with thick sauce, then ... roast beef; and mind it s good.",
      "Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then sweets.",
      "The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch s way not to call the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat them after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill: _Soupe printani re, turbot, sauce Beaumarchais, poulard l estragon, mac doine de fruits_ ...",
      "etc., and then instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill of fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "What shall we drink?",
      "What you like, only not too much.",
      "Champagne, said Levin.",
      "to start with?",
      "You re right though, I dare say.",
      "Do you like the white seal?",
      "_Cachet blanc,_ prompted the Tatar.",
      "Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we ll see.",
      "And what table wine?",
      "You can give us Nuits.",
      "Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.",
      "And _your_ cheese, your excellency?",
      "Oh, yes, Parmesan.",
      "Or would you like another?",
      "No, it s all the same to me, said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.",
      "And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and a bottle between his fingers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his waistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.",
      "Not bad, he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a silver fork, and swallowing them one after another.",
      "Not bad, he repeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.",
      "Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better.",
      "But he was admiring Oblonsky.",
      "Even the Tatar, uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction.",
      "You don t care much for oysters, do you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, emptying his wine-glass, or you re worried about something.",
      "He wanted Levin to be in good spirits.",
      "But it was not that Levin was not in good spirits; he was ill at ease.",
      "With what he had in his soul, he felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and bustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and waiters all of it was offensive to him.",
      "He was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of.",
      "Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me, he said.",
      "You can t conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer as that gentleman s nails I saw at your place....",
      "Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch s nails, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.",
      "It s too much for me, responded Levin.",
      "Do try, now, and put yourself in my place, take the point of view of a country person.",
      "We in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with.",
      "So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up our sleeves.",
      "And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as they will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can do nothing with their hands.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.",
      "Oh, yes, that s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work.",
      "His work is with the mind.... Maybe.",
      "But still it s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating oysters.... Why, of course, objected Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But that s just the aim of civilization to make everything a source of enjoyment.",
      "Well, if that s its aim, I d rather be a savage.",
      "And so you are a savage.",
      "All you Levins are savages.",
      "Levin sighed.",
      "He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and sore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention.",
      "Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys , I mean?",
      "he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.",
      "Yes, I shall certainly go, replied Levin; though I fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation.",
      "What nonsense!",
      "That s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!...",
      "That s her manner _grande dame,_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I m coming, too, but I have to go to the Countess Bonina s rehearsal.",
      "Come, isn t it true that you re a savage?",
      "How do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from Moscow?",
      "The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me about you, as though I ought to know.",
      "The only thing I know is that you always do what no one else does.",
      "Yes, said Levin, slowly and with emotion, you re right.",
      "I am a savage.",
      "Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming now.",
      "Now I have come.... Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!",
      "broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch, looking into Levin s eyes.",
      "I know a gallant steed by tokens sure, And by his eyes I know a youth in love, declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Everything is before you.",
      "Why, is it over for you already?",
      "No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is mine, and the present well, it s not all that it might be.",
      "How so?",
      "Oh, things go wrong.",
      "But I don t want to talk of myself, and besides I can t explain it all, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, why have you come to Moscow, then?...",
      "Hi!",
      "take away!",
      "he called to the Tatar.",
      "You guess?",
      "responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light fixed on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I guess, but I can t be the first to talk about it.",
      "You can see by that whether I guess right or wrong, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing at Levin with a subtle smile.",
      "Well, and what have you to say to me?",
      "said Levin in a quivering voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too.",
      "How do you look at the question?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking his eyes off Levin.",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, there s nothing I desire so much as that nothing!",
      "It would be the best thing that could be.",
      "But you re not making a mistake?",
      "You know what we re speaking of?",
      "said Levin, piercing him with his eyes.",
      "You think it s possible?",
      "I think it s possible.",
      "Why not possible?",
      "No!",
      "do you really think it s possible?",
      "No, tell me all you think!",
      "Oh, but if ... if refusal s in store for me!...",
      "Indeed I feel sure.... Why should you think that?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at his excitement.",
      "It seems so to me sometimes.",
      "That will be awful for me, and for her too.",
      "Oh, well, anyway there s nothing awful in it for a girl.",
      "Every girl s proud of an offer.",
      "Yes, every girl, but not she.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",
      "He so well knew that feeling of Levin s, that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes: one class all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with all sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other class she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all humanity.",
      "Stay, take some sauce, he said, holding back Levin s hand as it pushed away the sauce.",
      "Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan Arkadyevitch go on with his dinner.",
      "No, stop a minute, stop a minute, he said.",
      "You must understand that it s a question of life and death for me.",
      "I have never spoken to anyone of this.",
      "And there s no one I could speak of it to, except you.",
      "You know we re utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and everything; but I know you re fond of me and understand me, and that s why I like you awfully.",
      "But for God s sake, be quite straightforward with me.",
      "I tell you what I think, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "But I ll say more: my wife is a wonderful woman.... Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, remembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment s silence, resumed She has a gift of foreseeing things.",
      "She sees right through people; but that s not all; she knows what will come to pass, especially in the way of marriages.",
      "She foretold, for instance, that Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln.",
      "No one would believe it, but it came to pass.",
      "And she s on your side.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "It s not only that she likes you she says that Kitty is certain to be your wife.",
      "At these words Levin s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile not far from tears of emotion.",
      "She says that!",
      "cried Levin.",
      "I always said she was exquisite, your wife.",
      "There, that s enough, enough said about it, he said, getting up from his seat.",
      "All right, but do sit down.",
      "But Levin could not sit down.",
      "He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table.",
      "You must understand, said he, it s not love.",
      "I ve been in love, but it s not that.",
      "It s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me.",
      "I went away, you see, because I made up my mind that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not come on earth; but I ve struggled with myself, I see there s no living without it.",
      "And it must be settled.",
      "What did you go away for?",
      "Ah, stop a minute!",
      "Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one!",
      "The questions one must ask oneself!",
      "Listen.",
      "You can t imagine what you ve done for me by what you said.",
      "I m so happy that I ve become positively hateful; I ve forgotten everything.",
      "I heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know, he s here ...",
      "I had even forgotten him.",
      "It seems to me that he s happy too.",
      "It s a sort of madness.",
      "But one thing s awful....",
      "Here, you ve been married, you know the feeling ... it s awful that we old with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it s loathsome, and that s why one can t help feeling oneself unworthy.",
      "Oh, well, you ve not many sins on your conscience.",
      "Alas!",
      "all the same, said Levin, when with loathing I go over my life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it....",
      "Yes.",
      "What would you have?",
      "The world s made so, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy loving-kindness.",
      "That s the only way she can forgive me.",
      "Chapter 11 Levin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.",
      "There s one other thing I ought to tell you.",
      "Do you know Vronsky?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.",
      "No, I don t. Why do you ask?",
      "Give us another bottle, Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted.",
      "Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he s one of your rivals.",
      "Who s Vronsky?",
      "said Levin, and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.",
      "Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg.",
      "I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there for the levy of recruits.",
      "Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice, good-natured fellow.",
      "But he s more than simply a good-natured fellow, as I ve found out here he s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he s a man who ll make his mark.",
      "Levin scowled and was dumb.",
      "Well, he turned up here soon after you d gone, and as I can see, he s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her mother....",
      "Excuse me, but I know nothing, said Levin, frowning gloomily.",
      "And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him.",
      "You wait a bit, wait a bit, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and touching his hand.",
      "I ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I believe the chances are in your favor.",
      "Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.",
      "But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be, pursued Oblonsky, filling up his glass.",
      "No, thanks, I can t drink any more, said Levin, pushing away his glass.",
      "I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?",
      "he went on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.",
      "One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.",
      "Tonight I don t advise you to speak, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless you.... Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting?",
      "Come next spring, do, said Levin.",
      "Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He knew what was passing in Levin s soul.",
      "I ll come some day, he said.",
      "But women, my boy, they re the pivot everything turns upon.",
      "Things are in a bad way with me, very bad.",
      "And it s all through women.",
      "Tell me frankly now, he pursued, picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass; give me your advice.",
      "Why, what is it?",
      "I ll tell you.",
      "Suppose you re married, you love your wife, but you re fascinated by another woman....",
      "Excuse me, but I m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I can t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a baker s shop and steal a roll.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled more than usual.",
      "A roll will sometimes smell so good one can t resist it.",
      "Himmlisch ist s, wenn ich bezwungen Meine irdische Begier; Aber doch wenn s nich gelungen Hatt ich auch recht h bsch Plaisir!",
      "As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly.",
      "Levin, too, could not help smiling.",
      "Yes, but joking apart, resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, you must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and lonely, and has sacrificed everything.",
      "Now, when the thing s done, don t you see, can one possibly cast her off?",
      "Even supposing one parts from her, so as not to break up one s family life, still, can one help feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?",
      "Well, you must excuse me there.",
      "You know to me all women are divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and there are ...",
      "I ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never shall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women are the same.",
      "But the Magdalen?",
      "Ah, drop that!",
      "Christ would never have said those words if He had known how they would be abused.",
      "Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones remembered.",
      "However, I m not saying so much what I think, as what I feel.",
      "I have a loathing for fallen women.",
      "You re afraid of spiders, and I of these vermin.",
      "Most likely you ve not made a study of spiders and don t know their character; and so it is with me.",
      "It s very well for you to talk like that; it s very much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder.",
      "But to deny the facts is no answer.",
      "What s to be done you tell me that, what s to be done?",
      "Your wife gets older, while you re full of life.",
      "Before you ve time to look round, you feel that you can t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.",
      "And then all at once love turns up, and you re done for, done for, Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.",
      "Levin half smiled.",
      "Yes, you re done for, resumed Oblonsky.",
      "Don t steal rolls.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.",
      "Oh, moralist!",
      "But you must understand, there are two women; one insists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you can t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing.",
      "What are you to do?",
      "How are you to act?",
      "There s a fearful tragedy in it.",
      "If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I ll tell you that I don t believe there was any tragedy about it.",
      "And this is why.",
      "To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet, served as the test of men.",
      "Some men only understand one sort, and some only the other.",
      "And those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy.",
      "In such love there can be no sort of tragedy.",
      "I m much obliged for the gratification, my humble respects that s all the tragedy.",
      "And in platonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure, because.... At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through.",
      "And he added unexpectedly: But perhaps you are right.",
      "Very likely ...",
      "I don t know, I don t know.",
      "It s this, don t you see, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, you re very much all of a piece.",
      "That s your strong point and your failing.",
      "You have a character that s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but that s not how it is.",
      "You despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim and that s not how it is.",
      "You want a man s work, too, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to be undivided and that s not how it is.",
      "All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.",
      "Levin sighed and made no reply.",
      "He was thinking of his own affairs, and did not hear Oblonsky.",
      "And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though they had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they had nothing to do with one another.",
      "Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.",
      "Bill!",
      "he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector.",
      "And at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.",
      "When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys there to decide his fate.",
      "Chapter 12 The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen.",
      "It was the first winter that she had been out in the world.",
      "Her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even than her mother had anticipated.",
      "To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance: Levin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.",
      "Levin s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations between Kitty s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.",
      "The prince was on Levin s side; he said he wished for nothing better for Kitty.",
      "The princess for her part, going round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she did not state the principal point, which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter, and that Levin was not to her liking, and she did not understand him.",
      "When Levin had abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: You see I was right.",
      "When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.",
      "In the mother s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and Levin.",
      "She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and his queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and peasants.",
      "She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with her daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear.",
      "And suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared.",
      "It s as well he s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him, thought the mother.",
      "Vronsky satisfied all the mother s desires.",
      "Very wealthy, clever, of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court, and a fascinating man.",
      "Nothing better could be wished for.",
      "Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions.",
      "But, in spite of that, the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation.",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her aunt arranging the match.",
      "Her husband, about whom everything was well known beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at.",
      "The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression.",
      "That impression had been favorable.",
      "Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted.",
      "All had passed very simply and easily.",
      "So it seemed, at least, to the princess.",
      "But over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of marrying off one s daughters.",
      "The panics that had been lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been wasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls, Darya and Natalia!",
      "Now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls.",
      "The old prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters.",
      "He was irrationally jealous over his daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his favorite.",
      "At every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter.",
      "The princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince s touchiness.",
      "She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a mother s duties had become still more difficult.",
      "She saw that girls of Kitty s age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men s society; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not their parents .",
      "Marriages aren t made nowadays as they used to be, was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their elders.",
      "But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn from anyone.",
      "The French fashion of the parents arranging their children s future was not accepted; it was condemned.",
      "The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted, and not possible in Russian society.",
      "The Russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.",
      "But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one knew.",
      "Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing: Mercy on us, it s high time in our day to cast off all that old-fashioned business.",
      "It s the young people have to marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose.",
      "It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband.",
      "And, however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have been unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols.",
      "And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her elder sisters.",
      "Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter.",
      "She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man, and would not do this.",
      "But at the same time she knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl s head, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime.",
      "The week before, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a mazurka.",
      "This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at ease she could not be.",
      "Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.",
      "And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate, he told her.",
      "Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.",
      "But her mother saw them in a different light.",
      "She knew that the old lady was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother.",
      "However, she was so anxious for the marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she believed it was so.",
      "Bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter s fate engrossed all her feelings.",
      "Today, with Levin s reappearance, a fresh source of anxiety arose.",
      "She was afraid that her daughter, who had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.",
      "Why, has he been here long?",
      "the princess asked about Levin, as they returned home.",
      "He came today, mamma.",
      "There s one thing I want to say.... began the princess, and from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.",
      "Mamma, she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, please, please don t say anything about that.",
      "I know, I know all about it.",
      "She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her mother s wishes wounded her.",
      "I only want to say that to raise hopes.... Mamma, darling, for goodness sake, don t talk about it.",
      "It s so horrible to talk about it.",
      "I won t, said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter s eyes; but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from me.",
      "You won t?",
      "Never, mamma, none, answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking her mother straight in the face, but there s no use in my telling you anything, and I ...",
      "I ... if I wanted to, I don t know what to say or how....",
      "I don t know.... No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes, thought the mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness.",
      "The princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important.",
      "Chapter 13 After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle.",
      "Her heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.",
      "She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first time, would be a turning point in her life.",
      "And she was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together.",
      "When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin.",
      "The memories of childhood and of Levin s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him.",
      "His love for her, of which she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it was pleasant for her to think of Levin.",
      "In her memories of Vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in the highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some false note not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself, while with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear.",
      "But, on the other hand, directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future seemed misty.",
      "When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in complete possession of all her forces, she needed this so for what lay before her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements.",
      "At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room, when the footman announced, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.",
      "The princess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in.",
      "So it is to be, thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart.",
      "She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the looking-glass.",
      "At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer.",
      "And only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, different aspect; only then she realized that the question did not affect her only with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked.",
      "And to wound him cruelly.",
      "What for?",
      "Because he, dear fellow, loved her, was in love with her.",
      "But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would have to be.",
      "shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
      "Can I tell him I don t love him?",
      "That will be a lie.",
      "What am I to say to him?",
      "That I love someone else?",
      "No, that s impossible.",
      "I m going away, I m going away.",
      "She had reached the door, when she heard his step.",
      "it s not honest.",
      "What have I to be afraid of?",
      "I have done nothing wrong.",
      "What is to be, will be!",
      "I ll tell the truth.",
      "And with him one can t be ill at ease.",
      "Here he is, she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy figure, with his shining eyes fixed on her.",
      "She looked straight into his face, as though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.",
      "It s not time yet; I think I m too early, he said glancing round the empty drawing-room.",
      "When he saw that his expectations were realized, that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became gloomy.",
      "Oh, no, said Kitty, and sat down at the table.",
      "But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone, he began, not sitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.",
      "Mamma will be down directly.",
      "She was very much tired....",
      "Yesterday.... She talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him.",
      "He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.",
      "I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it depended on you.... She dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming.",
      "That it depended on you, he repeated.",
      "I meant to say ...",
      "I came for this ... to be my wife!",
      "he brought out, not knowing what he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said, he stopped short and looked at her.... She was breathing heavily, not looking at him.",
      "She was feeling ecstasy.",
      "Her soul was flooded with happiness.",
      "She had never anticipated that the utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her.",
      "But it lasted only an instant.",
      "She remembered Vronsky.",
      "She lifted her clear, truthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily: That cannot be ... forgive me.",
      "A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in his life!",
      "And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!",
      "It was bound to be so, he said, not looking at her.",
      "He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.",
      "Chapter 14 But at that very moment the princess came in.",
      "There was a look of horror on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces.",
      "Levin bowed to her, and said nothing.",
      "Kitty did not speak nor lift her eyes.",
      "Thank God, she has refused him, thought the mother, and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on Thursdays.",
      "She sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country.",
      "He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to arrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.",
      "Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty s, married the preceding winter, Countess Nordston.",
      "She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black eyes.",
      "She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself, as the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire to make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she wanted her to marry Vronsky.",
      "Levin she had often met at the Shtcherbatskys early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.",
      "Her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making fun of him.",
      "I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur, or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I m a fool, or is condescending to me.",
      "I like that so; to see him condescending!",
      "I am so glad he can t bear me, she used to say of him.",
      "She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness, her delicate contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly.",
      "The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another not seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on friendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each other.",
      "The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.",
      "Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "So you ve come back to our corrupt Babylon, she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a Babylon.",
      "Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?",
      "she added, glancing with a simper at Kitty.",
      "It s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so well, responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure, and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the Countess Nordston.",
      "They must certainly make a great impression on you.",
      "Oh, I should think so!",
      "I always note them all down.",
      "Well, Kitty, have you been skating again?...",
      "And she began talking to Kitty.",
      "Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw now, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes.",
      "He was on the point of getting up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed him.",
      "Shall you be long in Moscow?",
      "You re busy with the district council, though, aren t you, and can t be away for long?",
      "No, princess, I m no longer a member of the council, he said.",
      "I have come up for a few days.",
      "There s something the matter with him, thought Countess Nordston, glancing at his stern, serious face.",
      "He isn t in his old argumentative mood.",
      "But I ll draw him out.",
      "I do love making a fool of him before Kitty, and I ll do it.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch, she said to him, do explain to me, please, what s the meaning of it.",
      "You know all about such things.",
      "At home in our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed, and now they can t pay us any rent.",
      "What s the meaning of that?",
      "You always praise the peasants so.",
      "At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.",
      "Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can t tell you anything, he said, and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady.",
      "That must be Vronsky, thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced at Kitty.",
      "She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round at Levin.",
      "And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously brighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words.",
      "But what sort of a man was he?",
      "Now, whether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must find out what the man was like whom she loved.",
      "There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what, are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and to see only what is bad.",
      "There are people, on the other hand, who desire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he has outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good.",
      "Levin belonged to the second class.",
      "But he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky.",
      "It was apparent at the first glance.",
      "Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very tall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute face.",
      "Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant.",
      "Making way for the lady who had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then to Kitty.",
      "As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender light, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it seemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held out his small broad hand to her.",
      "Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once glancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.",
      "Let me introduce you, said the princess, indicating Levin.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.",
      "I believe I was to have dined with you this winter, he said, smiling his simple and open smile; but you had unexpectedly left for the country.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople, said Countess Nordston.",
      "My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them so well, said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the same thing before, he reddened.",
      "Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.",
      "Are you always in the country?",
      "he inquired.",
      "I should think it must be dull in the winter.",
      "It s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one s not dull by oneself, Levin replied abruptly.",
      "I am fond of the country, said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting not to notice, Levin s tone.",
      "But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country always, said Countess Nordston.",
      "I don t know; I have never tried for long.",
      "I experienced a queer feeling once, he went on.",
      "I never longed so for the country, Russian country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter with my mother in Nice.",
      "Nice itself is dull enough, you know.",
      "And indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time.",
      "And it s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and especially the country.",
      "It s as though....",
      "He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene, friendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what came into his head.",
      "Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped short without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to her.",
      "The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who always kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy guns the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and universal military service had not to move out either of them, while Countess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.",
      "Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation; saying to himself every instant, Now go, he still did not go, as though waiting for something.",
      "The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess Nordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels she had seen.",
      "Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity s sake do take me to see them!",
      "I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always on the lookout for it everywhere, said Vronsky, smiling.",
      "Very well, next Saturday, answered Countess Nordston.",
      "But you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?",
      "she asked Levin.",
      "Why do you ask me?",
      "You know what I shall say.",
      "But I want to hear your opinion.",
      "My opinion, answered Levin, is only that this table-turning simply proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants.",
      "They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while we.... Oh, then you don t believe in it?",
      "I can t believe in it, countess.",
      "But if I ve seen it myself?",
      "The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.",
      "Then you think I tell a lie?",
      "And she laughed a mirthless laugh.",
      "Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in it, said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still more exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was threatening to become disagreeable.",
      "You do not admit the conceivability at all?",
      "But why not?",
      "We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing.",
      "Why should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which....",
      "When electricity was discovered, Levin interrupted hurriedly, it was only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its applications were conceived.",
      "But the spiritualists have begun with tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force.",
      "Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen, obviously interested in his words.",
      "Yes, but the spiritualists say we don t know at present what this force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which it acts.",
      "Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.",
      "No, I don t see why there should not be a new force, if it.... Why, because with electricity, Levin interrupted again, every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon.",
      "Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to change the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.",
      "Do let us try at once, countess, he said; but Levin would finish saying what he thought.",
      "I think, he went on, that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.",
      "They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to material experiment.",
      "Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.",
      "And I think you would be a first-rate medium, said Countess Nordston; there s something enthusiastic in you.",
      "Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said nothing.",
      "Do let us try table-turning at once, please, said Vronsky.",
      "Princess, will you allow it?",
      "And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.",
      "Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin s. She felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying him for suffering of which she was herself the cause.",
      "If you can forgive me, forgive me, said her eyes, I am so happy.",
      "I hate them all, and you, and myself, his eyes responded, and he took up his hat.",
      "But he was not destined to escape.",
      "Just as they were arranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of retiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies, addressed Levin.",
      "he began joyously.",
      "Been here long, my boy?",
      "I didn t even know you were in town.",
      "Very glad to see you.",
      "The old prince embraced Levin, and talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was serenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.",
      "Kitty felt how distasteful her father s warmth was to Levin after what had happened.",
      "She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to Vronsky s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.",
      "Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said Countess Nordston; we want to try an experiment.",
      "What experiment?",
      "Table-turning?",
      "Well, you must excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game, said the old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his suggestion.",
      "There s some sense in that, anyway.",
      "Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and, with a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of the great ball that was to come off next week.",
      "I hope you will be there?",
      "he said to Kitty.",
      "As soon as the old prince turned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of Kitty answering Vronsky s inquiry about the ball.",
      "Chapter 15 At the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation with Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was glad at the thought that she had received an _offer_.",
      "She had no doubt that she had acted rightly.",
      "But after she had gone to bed, for a long while she could not sleep.",
      "One impression pursued her relentlessly.",
      "It was Levin s face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking out in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father, and glancing at her and at Vronsky.",
      "And she felt so sorry for him that tears came into her eyes.",
      "But immediately she thought of the man for whom she had given him up.",
      "She vividly recalled his manly, resolute face, his noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in everything towards everyone.",
      "She remembered the love for her of the man she loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on the pillow, smiling with happiness.",
      "I m sorry, I m sorry; but what could I do?",
      "It s not my fault, she said to herself; but an inner voice told her something else.",
      "Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin s love, or at having refused him, she did not know.",
      "But her happiness was poisoned by doubts.",
      "Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us!",
      "she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.",
      "Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince s little library, one of the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their favorite daughter.",
      "What?",
      "I ll tell you what!",
      "shouted the prince, waving his arms, and at once wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again.",
      "That you ve no pride, no dignity; that you re disgracing, ruining your daughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!",
      "But, really, for mercy s sake, prince, what have I done?",
      "said the princess, almost crying.",
      "She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had gone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no intention of telling him of Levin s offer and Kitty s refusal, still she hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically settled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his mother arrived.",
      "And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at once flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.",
      "What have you done?",
      "I ll tell you what.",
      "First of all, you re trying to catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and with good reason.",
      "If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don t pick out the possible suitors.",
      "Invite all the young bucks.",
      "Engage a piano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays, hunting up good matches.",
      "It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you ve gone on till you ve turned the poor wench s head.",
      "Levin s a thousand times the better man.",
      "As for this little Petersburg swell, they re turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.",
      "But if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after anyone.",
      "But what have I done?",
      "Why, you ve....",
      "The prince was crying wrathfully.",
      "I know if one were to listen to you, interrupted the princess, we should never marry our daughter.",
      "If it s to be so, we d better go into the country.",
      "Well, and we had better.",
      "But do wait a minute.",
      "Do I try and catch them?",
      "I don t try to catch them in the least.",
      "A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love with her, and she, I fancy.... Oh, yes, you fancy!",
      "And how if she really is in love, and he s no more thinking of marriage than I am!...",
      "Oh, that I should live to see it!",
      "spiritualism!",
      "Nice!",
      "the ball!",
      "And the prince, imagining that he was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word.",
      "And this is how we re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she s really got the notion into her head....",
      "But what makes you suppose so?",
      "I don t suppose; I know.",
      "We have eyes for such things, though women-folk haven t. I see a man who has serious intentions, that s Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who s only amusing himself.",
      "Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...",
      "Well, you ll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.",
      "Well, well, we won t talk of it, the princess stopped him, recollecting her unlucky Dolly.",
      "By all means, and good-night!",
      "And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with a kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.",
      "The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had settled Kitty s future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky s intentions, but her husband s words had disturbed her.",
      "And returning to her own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like Kitty, repeated several times in her heart, Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity; Lord, have pity.",
      "Chapter 16 Vronsky had never had a real home life.",
      "His mother had been in her youth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life, and still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole fashionable world.",
      "His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been educated in the Corps of Pages.",
      "Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once got into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men.",
      "Although he did go more or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always hitherto been outside it.",
      "In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and coarse life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and innocent girl of his own rank, who cared for him.",
      "It never even entered his head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty.",
      "At balls he danced principally with her.",
      "He was a constant visitor at their house.",
      "He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all sorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a special meaning in her case.",
      "Although he said nothing to her that he could not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming more and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better he liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her.",
      "He did not know that his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite character, that it is courting young girls with no intention of marriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common among brilliant young men such as he was.",
      "It seemed to him that he was the first who had discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his discovery.",
      "If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he could have put himself at the point of view of the family and have heard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would have been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it.",
      "He could not believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and above all to her, could be wrong.",
      "Still less could he have believed that he ought to marry.",
      "Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility.",
      "He not only disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was, in accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he lived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all, ridiculous.",
      "But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were saying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys that the secret spiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much stronger that evening that some step must be taken.",
      "But what step could and ought to be taken he could not imagine.",
      "What is so exquisite, he thought, as he returned from the Shtcherbatskys , carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious feeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he had not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of tenderness at her love for him what is so exquisite is that not a word has been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in this unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly than ever she told me she loves me.",
      "And how secretly, simply, and most of all, how trustfully!",
      "I feel myself better, purer.",
      "I feel that I have a heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me.",
      "Those sweet, loving eyes!",
      "When she said: Indeed I do.... Well, what then?",
      "Oh, nothing.",
      "It s good for me, and good for her.",
      "And he began wondering where to finish the evening.",
      "He passed in review of the places he might go to.",
      "Club?",
      "a game of bezique, champagne with Ignatov?",
      "No, I m not going.",
      "_Ch teau des Fleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan.",
      "No, I m sick of it.",
      "That s why I like the Shtcherbatskys , that I m growing better.",
      "I ll go home.",
      "He went straight to his room at Dussots Hotel, ordered supper, and then undressed, and as soon as his head touched the pillow, fell into a sound sleep.",
      "Chapter 17 Next day at eleven o clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station of the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first person he came across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was expecting his sister by the same train.",
      "your excellency!",
      "cried Oblonsky, whom are you meeting?",
      "My mother, Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met Oblonsky.",
      "He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the steps.",
      "She is to be here from Petersburg today.",
      "I was looking out for you till two o clock last night.",
      "Where did you go after the Shtcherbatskys ?",
      "Home, answered Vronsky.",
      "I must own I felt so well content yesterday after the Shtcherbatskys that I didn t care to go anywhere.",
      "I know a gallant steed by tokens sure, And by his eyes I know a youth in love, declaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.",
      "Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it, but he promptly changed the subject.",
      "And whom are you meeting?",
      "I ve come to meet a pretty woman, said Oblonsky.",
      "You don t say so!",
      "_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.",
      "that s Madame Karenina, said Vronsky.",
      "You know her, no doubt?",
      "I think I do.",
      "Or perhaps not ...",
      "I really am not sure, Vronsky answered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and tedious evoked by the name Karenina.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely must know.",
      "All the world knows him.",
      "I know him by reputation and by sight.",
      "I know that he s clever, learned, religious somewhat....",
      "But you know that s not ... _not in my line,_ said Vronsky in English.",
      "Yes, he s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid man, observed Stepan Arkadyevitch, a splendid man.",
      "Oh, well, so much the better for him, said Vronsky smiling.",
      "Oh, you ve come, he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother s, standing at the door; come here.",
      "Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had felt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination he was associated with Kitty.",
      "Well, what do you say?",
      "Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the _diva?_ he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.",
      "Of course.",
      "I m collecting subscriptions.",
      "Oh, did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin?",
      "Yes; but he left rather early.",
      "He s a capital fellow, pursued Oblonsky.",
      "Isn t he?",
      "I don t know why it is, responded Vronsky, in all Moscow people present company of course excepted, he put in jestingly, there s something uncompromising.",
      "They are all on the defensive, lose their tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something....",
      "Yes, that s true, it is so, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing good-humoredly.",
      "Will the train soon be in?",
      "Vronsky asked a railway official.",
      "The train s signaled, answered the man.",
      "The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory bustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen and attendants, and people meeting the train.",
      "Through the frosty vapor could be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing the rails of the curving line.",
      "The hiss of the boiler could be heard on the distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.",
      "No, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell Vronsky of Levin s intentions in regard to Kitty.",
      "No, you ve not got a true impression of Levin.",
      "He s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out of humor, it s true, but then he is often very nice.",
      "He s such a true, honest nature, and a heart of gold.",
      "But yesterday there were special reasons, pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally oblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his friend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky.",
      "Yes, there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly happy or particularly unhappy.",
      "Vronsky stood still and asked directly: How so?",
      "Do you mean he made your _belle-s ur_ an offer yesterday?",
      "Maybe, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I fancied something of the sort yesterday.",
      "Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it must mean it....",
      "He s been so long in love, and I m very sorry for him.",
      "So that s it!",
      "I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better match, said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again, though I don t know him, of course, he added.",
      "Yes, that is a hateful position!",
      "That s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras.",
      "If you don t succeed with them it only proves that you ve not enough cash, but in this case one s dignity s at stake.",
      "But here s the train.",
      "The engine had already whistled in the distance.",
      "A few instants later the platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the air from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle wheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the engine-driver covered with frost.",
      "Behind the tender, setting the platform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog whining in it.",
      "At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating before coming to a standstill.",
      "A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one the impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards, holding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little merchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his shoulder.",
      "Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the passengers, totally oblivious of his mother.",
      "What he had just heard about Kitty excited and delighted him.",
      "Unconsciously he arched his chest, and his eyes flashed.",
      "He felt himself a conqueror.",
      "Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment, said the smart guard, going up to Vronsky.",
      "The guard s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and his approaching meeting with her.",
      "He did not in his heart respect his mother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her, though in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and with his own education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to his mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the more externally obedient and respectful his behavior, the less in his heart he respected and loved her.",
      "Chapter 18 Vronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the compartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting out.",
      "With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady s appearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society.",
      "He begged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must glance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on account of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her whole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as she passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and soft.",
      "As he looked round, she too turned her head.",
      "Her shining gray eyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone.",
      "In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips.",
      "It was as though her nature were so brimming over with something that against her will it showed itself now in the flash of her eyes, and now in her smile.",
      "Deliberately she shrouded the light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in the faintly perceptible smile.",
      "Vronsky stepped into the carriage.",
      "His mother, a dried-up old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips.",
      "Getting up from the seat and handing her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to kiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.",
      "You got my telegram?",
      "Quite well?",
      "Thank God.",
      "You had a good journey?",
      "said her son, sitting down beside her, and involuntarily listening to a woman s voice outside the door.",
      "He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met at the door.",
      "All the same I don t agree with you, said the lady s voice.",
      "It s the Petersburg view, madame.",
      "Not Petersburg, but simply feminine, she responded.",
      "Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.",
      "Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch.",
      "And could you see if my brother is here, and send him to me?",
      "said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back again into the compartment.",
      "Well, have you found your brother?",
      "said Countess Vronskaya, addressing the lady.",
      "Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.",
      "Your brother is here, he said, standing up.",
      "Excuse me, I did not know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight, said Vronsky, bowing, that no doubt you do not remember me.",
      "Oh, no, said she, I should have known you because your mother and I have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.",
      "As she spoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself in her smile.",
      "And still no sign of my brother.",
      "Do call him, Alexey, said the old countess.",
      "Vronsky stepped out onto the platform and shouted: Oblonsky!",
      "Here!",
      "Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching sight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step.",
      "And as soon as her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by its decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck, drew him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly.",
      "Vronsky gazed, never taking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why.",
      "But recollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again into the carriage.",
      "She s very sweet, isn t she?",
      "said the countess of Madame Karenina.",
      "Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her.",
      "We ve been talking all the way.",
      "And so you, I hear ... _vous filez le parfait amour.",
      "Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux._ I don t know what you are referring to, maman, he answered coldly.",
      "Come, maman, let us go.",
      "Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the countess.",
      "Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother, she said.",
      "And all my gossip is exhausted.",
      "I should have nothing more to tell you.",
      "Oh, no, said the countess, taking her hand.",
      "I could go all around the world with you and never be dull.",
      "You are one of those delightful women in whose company it s sweet to be silent as well as to talk.",
      "Now please don t fret over your son; you can t expect never to be parted.",
      "Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her eyes were smiling.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, the countess said in explanation to her son, has a little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.",
      "Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son and she of hers, said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up her face, a caressing smile intended for him.",
      "I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored, he said, promptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him.",
      "But apparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain, and she turned to the old countess.",
      "Thank you so much.",
      "The time has passed so quickly.",
      "Good-bye, countess.",
      "Good-bye, my love, answered the countess.",
      "Let me have a kiss of your pretty face.",
      "I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that I ve lost my heart to you.",
      "Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it and was delighted by it.",
      "She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her cheek to the countess s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same smile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to Vronsky.",
      "He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as though at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she freely and vigorously shook his hand.",
      "She went out with the rapid step which bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange lightness.",
      "Very charming, said the countess.",
      "That was just what her son was thinking.",
      "His eyes followed her till her graceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his face.",
      "He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her arm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously something that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt annoyed.",
      "Well, maman, are you perfectly well?",
      "he repeated, turning to his mother.",
      "Everything has been delightful.",
      "Alexander has been very good, and Marie has grown very pretty.",
      "She s very interesting.",
      "And she began telling him again of what interested her most the christening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in Petersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.",
      "Here s Lavrenty, said Vronsky, looking out of the window; now we can go, if you like.",
      "The old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the carriage to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up to go.",
      "Come; there s not such a crowd now, said Vronsky.",
      "The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the other baggage.",
      "Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were getting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with panic-stricken faces.",
      "The station-master, too, ran by in his extraordinary colored cap.",
      "Obviously something unusual had happened.",
      "The crowd who had left the train were running back again.",
      "What?...",
      "Where?...",
      "Flung himself!...",
      "Crushed!...",
      "was heard among the crowd.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm, turned back.",
      "They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door to avoid the crowd.",
      "The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the crowd to find out details of the disaster.",
      "A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.",
      "Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from the butler.",
      "Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse.",
      "Oblonsky was evidently upset.",
      "He frowned and seemed ready to cry.",
      "Ah, how awful!",
      "Ah, Anna, if you had seen it!",
      "Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly composed.",
      "Oh, if you had seen it, countess, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And his wife was there....",
      "It was awful to see her!...",
      "She flung herself on the body.",
      "They say he was the only support of an immense family.",
      "How awful!",
      "Couldn t one do anything for her?",
      "said Madame Karenina in an agitated whisper.",
      "Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.",
      "I ll be back directly, maman, he remarked, turning round in the doorway.",
      "When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already in conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the countess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.",
      "Now let us be off, said Vronsky, coming in.",
      "They went out together.",
      "Vronsky was in front with his mother.",
      "Behind walked Madame Karenina with her brother.",
      "Just as they were going out of the station the station-master overtook Vronsky.",
      "You gave my assistant two hundred roubles.",
      "Would you kindly explain for whose benefit you intend them?",
      "For the widow, said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders.",
      "I should have thought there was no need to ask.",
      "You gave that?",
      "cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his sister s hand, he added: Very nice, very nice!",
      "Isn t he a splendid fellow?",
      "And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.",
      "When they went out the Vronsky s carriage had already driven away.",
      "People coming in were still talking of what happened.",
      "What a horrible death!",
      "said a gentleman, passing by.",
      "They say he was cut in two pieces.",
      "On the contrary, I think it s the easiest instantaneous, observed another.",
      "How is it they don t take proper precautions?",
      "said a third.",
      "Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with difficulty restraining her tears.",
      "What is it, Anna?",
      "he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.",
      "It s an omen of evil, she said.",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "You ve come, that s the chief thing.",
      "You can t conceive how I m resting my hopes on you.",
      "Have you known Vronsky long?",
      "she asked.",
      "You know we re hoping he will marry Kitty.",
      "Yes?",
      "said Anna softly.",
      "Come now, let us talk of you, she added, tossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something superfluous oppressing her.",
      "Let us talk of your affairs.",
      "I got your letter, and here I am.",
      "Yes, all my hopes are in you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, tell me all about it.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.",
      "On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her hand, and set off to his office.",
      "Chapter 19 When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his father, giving him a lesson in French reading.",
      "As the boy read, he kept twisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his jacket.",
      "His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the fat little hand went back to the button again.",
      "His mother pulled the button off and put it in her pocket.",
      "Keep your hands still, Grisha, she said, and she took up her work, a coverlet she had long been making.",
      "She always set to work on it at depressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her fingers and counting the stitches.",
      "Though she had sent word the day before to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister came or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was expecting her sister-in-law with emotion.",
      "Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it.",
      "Still she did not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the most important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg _grande dame_.",
      "And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her threat to her husband that is to say, she remembered that her sister-in-law was coming.",
      "And, after all, Anna is in no wise to blame, thought Dolly.",
      "I know nothing of her except the very best, and I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself.",
      "It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at Petersburg at the Karenins , she did not like their household itself; there was something artificial in the whole framework of their family life.",
      "But why should I not receive her?",
      "If only she doesn t take it into her head to console me!",
      "thought Dolly.",
      "All consolation and counsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a thousand times, and it s all no use.",
      "All these days Dolly had been alone with her children.",
      "She did not want to talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not talk of outside matters.",
      "She knew that in one way or another she would tell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of speaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her humiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases of good advice and comfort.",
      "She had been on the lookout for her, glancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip just that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the bell.",
      "Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked round, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but wonder.",
      "She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.",
      "What, here already!",
      "she said as she kissed her.",
      "Dolly, how glad I am to see you!",
      "I am glad, too, said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the expression of Anna s face to find out whether she knew.",
      "Most likely she knows, she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna s face.",
      "Well, come along, I ll take you to your room, she went on, trying to defer as long as possible the moment of confidences.",
      "Is this Grisha?",
      "Heavens, how he s grown!",
      "said Anna; and kissing him, never taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a little.",
      "No, please, let us stay here.",
      "She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her hair down.",
      "You are radiant with health and happiness!",
      "said Dolly, almost with envy.",
      "I?...",
      "Yes, said Anna.",
      "Merciful heavens, Tanya!",
      "You re the same age as my Seryozha, she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.",
      "She took her in her arms and kissed her.",
      "Delightful child, delightful!",
      "Show me them all.",
      "She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years, months, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not but appreciate that.",
      "Very well, we will go to them, she said.",
      "It s a pity Vassya s asleep.",
      "After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the drawing-room, to coffee.",
      "Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away from her.",
      "Dolly, she said, he has told me.",
      "Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of conventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.",
      "Dolly, dear, she said, I don t want to speak for him to you, nor to try to comfort you; that s impossible.",
      "But, darling, I m simply sorry, sorry from my heart for you!",
      "Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.",
      "She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous little hand.",
      "Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its frigid expression.",
      "She said: To comfort me s impossible.",
      "Everything s lost after what has happened, everything s over!",
      "And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened.",
      "Anna lifted the wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said: But, Dolly, what s to be done, what s to be done?",
      "How is it best to act in this awful position that s what you must think of.",
      "All s over, and there s nothing more, said Dolly.",
      "And the worst of all is, you see, that I can t cast him off: there are the children, I am tied.",
      "And I can t live with him!",
      "it s a torture to me to see him.",
      "Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you: tell me about it.",
      "Dolly looked at her inquiringly.",
      "Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna s face.",
      "Very well, she said all at once.",
      "But I will tell you it from the beginning.",
      "You know how I was married.",
      "With the education mamma gave us I was more than innocent, I was stupid.",
      "I knew nothing.",
      "I know they say men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva she corrected herself Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing.",
      "You ll hardly believe it, but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known.",
      "So I lived eight years.",
      "You must understand that I was so far from suspecting infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then try to imagine it with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all the loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me.",
      "To be fully convinced of one s happiness, and all at once.... continued Dolly, holding back her sobs, to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress, my governess.",
      "No, it s too awful!",
      "She hastily pulled out her handkerchief and hid her face in it.",
      "I can understand being carried away by feeling, she went on after a brief silence, but deliberately, slyly deceiving me ... and with whom?...",
      "To go on being my husband together with her ... it s awful!",
      "You can t understand.... Oh, yes, I understand!",
      "I understand!",
      "Dolly, dearest, I do understand, said Anna, pressing her hand.",
      "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
      "Dolly resumed.",
      "Not the slightest!",
      "He s happy and contented.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "Anna interposed quickly.",
      "He s to be pitied, he s weighed down by remorse.... Is he capable of remorse?",
      "Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her sister-in-law s face.",
      "I know him.",
      "I could not look at him without feeling sorry for him.",
      "We both know him.",
      "He s good-hearted, but he s proud, and now he s so humiliated.",
      "What touched me most.... (and here Anna guessed what would touch Dolly most) he s tortured by two things: that he s ashamed for the children s sake, and that, loving you yes, yes, loving you beyond everything on earth, she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would have answered he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart.",
      "No, no, she cannot forgive me, he keeps saying.",
      "Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to her words.",
      "Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it s worse for the guilty than the innocent, she said, if he feels that all the misery comes from his fault.",
      "But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife again after her?",
      "For me to live with him now would be torture, just because I love my past love for him.... And sobs cut short her words.",
      "But as though of set design, each time she was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.",
      "She s young, you see, she s pretty, she went on.",
      "Do you know, Anna, my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom?",
      "By him and his children.",
      "I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service, and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him.",
      "No doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent.",
      "Do you understand?",
      "Again her eyes glowed with hatred.",
      "And after that he will tell me.... What!",
      "can I believe him?",
      "Never!",
      "No, everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture.",
      "What have I to strive and toil for?",
      "Why are the children here?",
      "What s so awful is that all at once my heart s turned, and instead of love and tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred.",
      "I could kill him.",
      "Darling Dolly, I understand, but don t torture yourself.",
      "You are so distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.",
      "Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.",
      "Think for me, Anna, help me.",
      "I have thought over everything, and I see nothing.",
      "Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each word, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.",
      "One thing I would say, began Anna.",
      "I am his sister, I know his character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything (she waved her hand before her forehead), that faculty for being completely carried away, but for completely repenting too.",
      "He cannot believe it, he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.",
      "No; he understands, he understood!",
      "Dolly broke in.",
      "But I ... you are forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?",
      "Wait a minute.",
      "When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the awfulness of your position.",
      "I saw nothing but him, and that the family was broken up.",
      "I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see it, as a woman, quite differently.",
      "I see your agony, and I can t tell you how sorry I am for you!",
      "But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your sufferings, only there is one thing I don t know; I don t know ...",
      "I don t know how much love there is still in your heart for him.",
      "That you know whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him.",
      "If there is, forgive him!",
      "No, Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand once more.",
      "I know more of the world than you do, she said.",
      "I know how men like Stiva look at it.",
      "You speak of his talking of you with her.",
      "That never happened.",
      "Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to them.",
      "Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family.",
      "They draw a sort of line that can t be crossed between them and their families.",
      "I don t understand it, but it is so.",
      "Yes, but he has kissed her.... Dolly, hush, darling.",
      "I saw Stiva when he was in love with you.",
      "I remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes.",
      "You know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word: Dolly s a marvelous woman.",
      "You have always been a divinity for him, and you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the heart....",
      "But if it is repeated?",
      "It cannot be, as I understand it....",
      "Yes, but could you forgive it?",
      "I don t know, I can t judge....",
      "Yes, I can, said Anna, thinking a moment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her inner balance, she added: Yes, I can, I can, I can.",
      "Yes, I could forgive it.",
      "I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all.... Oh, of course, Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she had more than once thought, else it would not be forgiveness.",
      "If one forgives, it must be completely, completely.",
      "Come, let us go; I ll take you to your room, she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced Anna.",
      "My dear, how glad I am you came.",
      "It has made things better, ever so much better.",
      "Chapter 20 The whole of that day Anna spent at home, that s to say at the Oblonskys , and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day.",
      "Anna spent the whole morning with Dolly and the children.",
      "She merely sent a brief note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.",
      "Come, God is merciful, she wrote.",
      "Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife, speaking to him, addressed him as Stiva, as she had not done before.",
      "In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.",
      "Immediately after dinner Kitty came in.",
      "She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but only very slightly, and she came now to her sister s with some trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of.",
      "But she made a favorable impression on Anna Arkadyevna she saw that at once.",
      "Anna was unmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew where she was she found herself not merely under Anna s sway, but in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married women.",
      "Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of eight years old.",
      "In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and the unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her eyes, which struck and attracted Kitty.",
      "Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.",
      "After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.",
      "Stiva, she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing towards the door, go, and God help you.",
      "He threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the doorway.",
      "When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children.",
      "Either because the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they felt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the younger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about their new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side.",
      "And it had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to their aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her ring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.",
      "Come, come, as we were sitting before, said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting down in her place.",
      "And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with his head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.",
      "And when is your next ball?",
      "she asked Kitty.",
      "Next week, and a splendid ball.",
      "One of those balls where one always enjoys oneself.",
      "Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?",
      "Anna said, with tender irony.",
      "It s strange, but there are.",
      "At the Bobrishtchevs one always enjoys oneself, and at the Nikitins too, while at the Mezhkovs it s always dull.",
      "Haven t you noticed it?",
      "No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself, said Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which was not open to her.",
      "For me there are some less dull and tiresome.",
      "How can _you_ be dull at a ball?",
      "Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?",
      "inquired Anna.",
      "Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.",
      "Because you always look nicer than anyone.",
      "Anna had the faculty of blushing.",
      "She blushed a little, and said: In the first place it s never so; and secondly, if it were, what difference would it make to me?",
      "Are you coming to this ball?",
      "asked Kitty.",
      "I imagine it won t be possible to avoid going.",
      "Here, take it, she said to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her white, slender-tipped finger.",
      "I shall be so glad if you go.",
      "I should so like to see you at a ball.",
      "Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it s a pleasure to you ... Grisha, don t pull my hair.",
      "It s untidy enough without that, she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had been playing with.",
      "I imagine you at the ball in lilac.",
      "And why in lilac precisely?",
      "asked Anna, smiling.",
      "Now, children, run along, run along.",
      "Do you hear?",
      "Miss Hoole is calling you to tea, she said, tearing the children from her, and sending them off to the dining-room.",
      "I know why you press me to come to the ball.",
      "You expect a great deal of this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.",
      "what a happy time you are at, pursued Anna.",
      "I remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland.",
      "That mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not been through it?",
      "Kitty smiled without speaking.",
      "But how did she go through it?",
      "How I should like to know all her love story!",
      "thought Kitty, recalling the unromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.",
      "I know something.",
      "Stiva told me, and I congratulate you.",
      "I liked him so much, Anna continued.",
      "I met Vronsky at the railway station.",
      "Oh, was he there?",
      "asked Kitty, blushing.",
      "What was it Stiva told you?",
      "Stiva gossiped about it all.",
      "And I should be so glad ...",
      "I traveled yesterday with Vronsky s mother, she went on; and his mother talked without a pause of him, he s her favorite.",
      "I know mothers are partial, but.... What did his mother tell you?",
      "Oh, a great deal!",
      "And I know that he s her favorite; still one can see how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of the water.",
      "He s a hero, in fact, said Anna, smiling and recollecting the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.",
      "But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles.",
      "For some reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it.",
      "She felt that there was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought not to have been.",
      "She pressed me very much to go and see her, Anna went on; and I shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow.",
      "Stiva is staying a long while in Dolly s room, thank God, Anna added, changing the subject, and getting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.",
      "No, I m first!",
      "No, I!",
      "screamed the children, who had finished tea, running up to their Aunt Anna.",
      "All together, said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking with delight.",
      "Chapter 21 Dolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch did not come out.",
      "He must have left his wife s room by the other door.",
      "I am afraid you ll be cold upstairs, observed Dolly, addressing Anna; I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.",
      "Oh, please, don t trouble about me, answered Anna, looking intently into Dolly s face, trying to make out whether there had been a reconciliation or not.",
      "It will be lighter for you here, answered her sister-in-law.",
      "I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.",
      "What s the question?",
      "inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his room and addressing his wife.",
      "From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken place.",
      "I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds.",
      "No one knows how to do it; I must see to it myself, answered Dolly addressing him.",
      "God knows whether they are fully reconciled, thought Anna, hearing her tone, cold and composed.",
      "Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties, answered her husband.",
      "Come, I ll do it all, if you like....",
      "Yes, they must be reconciled, thought Anna.",
      "I know how you do everything, answered Dolly.",
      "You tell Matvey to do what can t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle of everything, and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of Dolly s lips as she spoke.",
      "Full, full reconciliation, full, thought Anna; thank God!",
      "and rejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly and kissed her.",
      "Not at all.",
      "Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.",
      "The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to her husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not so as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his offense.",
      "At half-past nine o clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family conversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys was broken up by an apparently simple incident.",
      "But this simple incident for some reason struck everyone as strange.",
      "Talking about common acquaintances in Petersburg, Anna got up quickly.",
      "She is in my album, she said; and, by the way, I ll show you my Seryozha, she added, with a mother s smile of pride.",
      "Towards ten o clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and often before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed at being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept coming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha.",
      "She longed to look at his photograph and talk of him.",
      "Seizing the first pretext, she got up, and with her light, resolute step went for her album.",
      "The stairs up to her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.",
      "Just as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.",
      "Who can that be?",
      "said Dolly.",
      "It s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it s late, observed Kitty.",
      "Sure to be someone with papers for me, put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running up to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing under a lamp.",
      "Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a strange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something stirred in her heart.",
      "He was standing still, not taking off his coat, pulling something out of his pocket.",
      "At the instant when she was just facing the stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and into the expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and dismay.",
      "With a slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing behind her Stepan Arkadyevitch s loud voice calling him to come up, and the quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.",
      "When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.",
      "And nothing would induce him to come up.",
      "What a queer fellow he is!",
      "added Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Kitty blushed.",
      "She thought that she was the only person who knew why he had come, and why he would not come up.",
      "He has been at home, she thought, and didn t find me, and thought I should be here, but he did not come up because he thought it late, and Anna s here.",
      "All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at Anna s album.",
      "There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man s calling at half-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner party and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them.",
      "Above all, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.",
      "Chapter 22 The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats.",
      "From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as from a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing between trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before the mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of the fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz.",
      "A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know.",
      "A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called young bucks, in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille.",
      "As the first quadrille had already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this youth the second.",
      "An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the doorway, and stroking his mustache, admired rosy Kitty.",
      "Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment s attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of it.",
      "When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother, tried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn back a little.",
      "She felt that everything must be right of itself, and graceful, and nothing could need setting straight.",
      "It was one of Kitty s best days.",
      "Her dress was not uncomfortable anywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not crushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels did not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair chignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair.",
      "All the three buttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her hand without concealing its lines.",
      "The black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck.",
      "That velvet was delicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had felt that that velvet was speaking.",
      "About all the rest there might be a doubt, but the velvet was delicious.",
      "Kitty smiled here too, at the ball, when she glanced at it in the glass.",
      "Her bare shoulders and arms gave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked.",
      "Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from the consciousness of her own attractiveness.",
      "She had scarcely entered the ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons, lace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance Kitty was never one of that throng when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best partner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned director of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka Korsunsky.",
      "He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had danced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom that is to say, a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of Kitty, entering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is confined to directors of balls.",
      "Without even asking her if she cared to dance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist.",
      "She looked round for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to her, took it.",
      "How nice you ve come in good time, he said to her, embracing her waist; such a bad habit to be late.",
      "Bending her left hand, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music.",
      "It s a rest to waltz with you, he said to her, as they fell into the first slow steps of the waltz.",
      "It s exquisite such lightness, precision.",
      "He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his partners whom he knew well.",
      "She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his shoulder.",
      "She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces in the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland.",
      "And she was not a girl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the ballroom was familiar and tiresome.",
      "But she was in the middle stage between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had sufficient self-possession to be able to observe.",
      "In the left corner of the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.",
      "There incredibly naked was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky s wife; there was the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to be found where the best people were.",
      "In that direction gazed the young men, not venturing to approach.",
      "There, too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown.",
      "And _he_ was there.",
      "Kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused Levin.",
      "With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and was even aware that he was looking at her.",
      "Another turn, eh?",
      "You re not tired?",
      "said Korsunsky, a little out of breath.",
      "No, thank you!",
      "Where shall I take you?",
      "Madame Karenina s here, I think ... take me to her.",
      "Wherever you command.",
      "And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the group in the left corner, continually saying, Pardon, mesdames, pardon, pardon, mesdames ; and steering his course through the sea of lace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his partner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent stockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape and covered Krivin s knees.",
      "Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open shirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin s knees, and, a little giddy, looked round, seeking Anna.",
      "Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had so urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her full throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory, and her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists.",
      "The whole gown was trimmed with Venetian guipure.",
      "On her head, among her black hair her own, with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace.",
      "Her coiffure was not striking.",
      "All that was noticeable was the little wilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about her neck and temples.",
      "Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of pearls.",
      "Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured her invariably in lilac.",
      "But now seeing her in black, she felt that she had not fully seen her charm.",
      "She saw her now as someone quite new and surprising to her.",
      "Now she understood that Anna could not have been in lilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against her attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her.",
      "And her black dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was only the frame, and all that was seen was she simple, natural, elegant, and at the same time gay and eager.",
      "She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty drew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her head slightly turned towards him.",
      "No, I don t throw stones, she was saying, in answer to something, though I can t understand it, she went on, shrugging her shoulders, and she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.",
      "With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a movement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty, signifying approval of her dress and her looks.",
      "You came into the room dancing, she added.",
      "This is one of my most faithful supporters, said Korsunsky, bowing to Anna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen.",
      "The princess helps to make balls happy and successful.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?",
      "he said, bending down to her.",
      "Why, have you met?",
      "inquired their host.",
      "Is there anyone we have not met?",
      "My wife and I are like white wolves everyone knows us, answered Korsunsky.",
      "A waltz, Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "I don t dance when it s possible not to dance, she said.",
      "But tonight it s impossible, answered Korsunsky.",
      "At that instant Vronsky came up.",
      "Well, since it s impossible tonight, let us start, she said, not noticing Vronsky s bow, and she hastily put her hand on Korsunsky s shoulder.",
      "What is she vexed with him about?",
      "thought Kitty, discerning that Anna had intentionally not responded to Vronsky s bow.",
      "Vronsky went up to Kitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time.",
      "Kitty gazed in admiration at Anna waltzing, and listened to him.",
      "She expected him to ask her for a waltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him.",
      "He flushed slightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped.",
      "Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her own, and long afterwards for several years after that look, full of love, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony of shame.",
      "_Pardon!",
      "pardon!_ Waltz!",
      "waltz!",
      "shouted Korsunsky from the other side of the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself.",
      "Chapter 23 Vronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room.",
      "After the first waltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few words to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first quadrille.",
      "During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said: there was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and wife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at forty, and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation touched her to the quick, when he asked her about Levin, whether he was here, and added that he liked him so much.",
      "But Kitty did not expect much from the quadrille.",
      "She looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka.",
      "She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided.",
      "The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her.",
      "She felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls, and refused five young men, saying she was engaged for the mazurka.",
      "The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors, sounds, and motions.",
      "She only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest.",
      "But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse, she chanced to be _vis- -vis_ with Vronsky and Anna.",
      "She had not been near Anna again since the beginning of the evening, and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising.",
      "She saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting.",
      "She knew that feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the quivering, flashing light in her eyes, and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips, and the deliberate grace, precision, and lightness of her movements.",
      "Who?",
      "she asked herself.",
      "All or one?",
      "And not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation, the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again, she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into the _grand rond_, and then into the _cha ne_, and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart.",
      "No, it s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one.",
      "And that one?",
      "can it be he?",
      "Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips.",
      "She seemed to make an effort to control herself, to try not to show these signs of delight, but they came out on her face of themselves.",
      "But what of him?",
      "Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror.",
      "What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna s face she saw in him.",
      "What had become of his always self-possessed resolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of his face?",
      "Now every time he turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would have fallen at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread.",
      "I would not offend you, his eyes seemed every time to be saying, but I want to save myself, and I don t know how.",
      "On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.",
      "They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers.",
      "And strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and how the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words had all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as Kitty did.",
      "The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty s soul.",
      "Nothing but the stern discipline of her bringing-up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.",
      "But before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty.",
      "She had refused five partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka.",
      "She had not even a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now.",
      "She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home, but she had not the strength to do this.",
      "She felt crushed.",
      "She went to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low chair.",
      "Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face.",
      "But while she looked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her heart ached with a horrible despair.",
      "But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?",
      "And again she recalled all she had seen.",
      "Kitty, what is it?",
      "said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her.",
      "I don t understand it.",
      "Kitty s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.",
      "Kitty, you re not dancing the mazurka?",
      "No, no, said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.",
      "He asked her for the mazurka before me, said Countess Nordston, knowing Kitty would understand who were he and her.",
      "She said: Why, aren t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?",
      "Oh, I don t care!",
      "answered Kitty.",
      "No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him because she had put her faith in another.",
      "Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the mazurka, and told him to ask Kitty.",
      "Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to talk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure.",
      "Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her.",
      "She saw them with her long-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the figures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete.",
      "She saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room.",
      "And on Vronsky s face, always so firm and independent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and humble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.",
      "Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him.",
      "She grew thoughtful, and he became serious.",
      "Some supernatural force drew Kitty s eyes to Anna s face.",
      "She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination.",
      "Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her suffering.",
      "Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it.",
      "When Vronsky saw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize her, she was so changed.",
      "Delightful ball!",
      "he said to her, for the sake of saying something.",
      "Yes, she answered.",
      "In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly invented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle, chose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty.",
      "Kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up.",
      "Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and smiled, pressing her hand.",
      "But, noticing that Kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her, and began gaily talking to the other lady.",
      "Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her, Kitty said to herself.",
      "Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began to press her to do so.",
      "Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna, said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat, I ve such an idea for a _cotillion!",
      "Un bijou!_ And he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him.",
      "Their host smiled approvingly.",
      "No, I am not going to stay, answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of her smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay.",
      "No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I have all the winter in Petersburg, said Anna, looking round at Vronsky, who stood near her.",
      "I must rest a little before my journey.",
      "Are you certainly going tomorrow then?",
      "asked Vronsky.",
      "Yes, I suppose so, answered Anna, as it were wondering at the boldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.",
      "Chapter 24 Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive, thought Levin, as he came away from the Shtcherbatskys , and walked in the direction of his brother s lodgings.",
      "And I don t get on with other people.",
      "Pride, they say.",
      "No, I have no pride.",
      "If I had any pride, I should not have put myself in such a position.",
      "And he pictured to himself Vronsky, happy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening.",
      "Yes, she was bound to choose him.",
      "So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone or anything.",
      "I am myself to blame.",
      "What right had I to imagine she would care to join her life to mine?",
      "Who am I and what am I?",
      "A nobody, not wanted by anyone, nor of use to anybody.",
      "And he recalled his brother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him.",
      "Isn t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?",
      "And are we fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay?",
      "Of course, from the point of view of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he s a despicable person.",
      "But I know him differently.",
      "I know his soul, and know that we are like him.",
      "And I, instead of going to seek him out, went out to dinner, and came here.",
      "Levin walked up to a lamppost, read his brother s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a sledge.",
      "All the long way to his brother s, Levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay s life.",
      "He remembered how his brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards, had, in spite of the jeers of his companions, lived like a monk, strictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and avoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women.",
      "And afterwards, how he had all at once broken out: he had associated with the most horrible people, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery.",
      "He remembered later the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from the country to bring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding.",
      "Then he recalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and given a promissory note, and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint, asserting that he had cheated him.",
      "(This was the money Sergey Ivanovitch had paid.)",
      "Then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street.",
      "He remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother Sergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder....",
      "It was all horribly disgusting, yet to Levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all his story, did not know his heart.",
      "Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the period of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone, far from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the others.",
      "They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he had broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust.",
      "Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother Nikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him.",
      "He was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence.",
      "But he had always wanted to be good.",
      "I will tell him everything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve, too, and I ll show him that I love him, and so understand him, Levin resolved to himself, as, towards eleven o clock, he reached the hotel of which he had the address.",
      "At the top, 12 and 13, the porter answered Levin s inquiry.",
      "At home?",
      "Sure to be at home.",
      "The door of No.",
      "12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice, unknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he heard his cough.",
      "As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying: It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing s done.",
      "Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was sitting on the sofa.",
      "His brother was not to be seen.",
      "Konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life.",
      "No one had heard him, and Konstantin, taking off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying.",
      "He was speaking of some enterprise.",
      "Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes, his brother s voice responded, with a cough.",
      "Masha!",
      "get us some supper and some wine if there s any left; or else go and get some.",
      "The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.",
      "There s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch, she said.",
      "Whom do you want?",
      "said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.",
      "It s I, answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.",
      "Who s _I_?",
      "Nikolay s voice said again, still more angrily.",
      "He could be heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin saw, facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge, thin, stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness.",
      "He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had seen him last.",
      "He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever.",
      "His hair had grown thinner, the same straight mustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and na vely at his visitor.",
      "Ah, Kostya!",
      "he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and his eyes lit up with joy.",
      "But the same second he looked round at the young man, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin knew so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different expression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.",
      "I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don t know you and don t want to know you.",
      "What is it you want?",
      "He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him.",
      "The worst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations with him so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he thought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that nervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.",
      "I didn t want to see you for anything, he answered timidly.",
      "I ve simply come to see you.",
      "His brother s timidity obviously softened Nikolay.",
      "His lips twitched.",
      "Oh, so that s it?",
      "Well, come in; sit down.",
      "Like some supper?",
      "Masha, bring supper for three.",
      "No, stop a minute.",
      "Do you know who this is?",
      "he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin: This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a very remarkable man.",
      "He s persecuted by the police, of course, because he s not a scoundrel.",
      "And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.",
      "Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he shouted to her, Wait a minute, I said.",
      "And with the inability to express himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he began, with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother Kritsky s story: how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools; and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how he had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned for something.",
      "You re of the Kiev university?",
      "said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to break the awkward silence that followed.",
      "Yes, I was of Kiev, Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.",
      "And this woman, Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her, is the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "I took her out of a bad house, and he jerked his neck saying this; but I love her and respect her, and anyone who wants to know me, he added, raising his voice and knitting his brows, I beg to love her and respect her.",
      "She s just the same as my wife, just the same.",
      "So now you know whom you ve to do with.",
      "And if you think you re lowering yourself, well, here s the floor, there s the door.",
      "And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.",
      "Why I should be lowering myself, I don t understand.",
      "Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and wine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn t matter.... Go along.",
      "Chapter 25 So you see, pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching.",
      "It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.",
      "Here, do you see?",
      "...",
      "He pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened together with strings, lying in a corner of the room.",
      "Do you see that?",
      "That s the beginning of a new thing we re going into.",
      "It s a productive association.... Konstantin scarcely heard him.",
      "He looked into his sickly, consumptive face, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association.",
      "He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from self-contempt.",
      "Nikolay Levin went on talking: You know that capital oppresses the laborer.",
      "The laborers with us, the peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however much they work they can t escape from their position of beasts of burden.",
      "All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education, all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists.",
      "And society s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of burden to the end.",
      "And that state of things must be changed, he finished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.",
      "Yes, of course, said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother s projecting cheekbones.",
      "And so we re founding a locksmiths association, where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common.",
      "Where is the association to be?",
      "asked Konstantin Levin.",
      "In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.",
      "But why in a village?",
      "In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work as it is.",
      "Why a locksmiths association in a village?",
      "Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were, and that s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don t like people to try and get them out of their slavery, said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the objection.",
      "Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room.",
      "This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.",
      "I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch s aristocratic views.",
      "I know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.",
      "No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?",
      "said Levin, smiling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch?",
      "I ll tell you what for!",
      "Nikolay Levin shrieked suddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I ll tell you what for....",
      "But what s the use of talking?",
      "There s only one thing.... What did you come to me for?",
      "You look down on this, and you re welcome to, and go away, in God s name go away!",
      "he shrieked, getting up from his chair.",
      "And go away, and go away!",
      "I don t look down on it at all, said Konstantin Levin timidly.",
      "I don t even dispute it.",
      "At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back.",
      "Nikolay Levin looked round angrily at her.",
      "She went quickly to him, and whispered something.",
      "I m not well; I ve grown irritable, said Nikolay Levin, getting calmer and breathing painfully; and then you talk to me of Sergey Ivanovitch and his article.",
      "It s such rubbish, such lying, such self-deception.",
      "What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it?",
      "Have you read his article?",
      "he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at the table, and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so as to clear a space.",
      "I ve not read it, Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation.",
      "said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon Kritsky.",
      "Because I didn t see the use of wasting my time over it.",
      "Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?",
      "That article s too deep for many people that s to say it s over their heads.",
      "But with me, it s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.",
      "Everyone was mute.",
      "Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.",
      "Won t you have supper?",
      "All right, good-bye!",
      "Come round tomorrow with the locksmith.",
      "Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.",
      "He s no good either, he said.",
      "I see, of course....",
      "But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him.... What do you want now?",
      "he said, and went out to him in the passage.",
      "Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.",
      "Have you been long with my brother?",
      "he said to her.",
      "Yes, more than a year.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch s health has become very poor.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal, she said.",
      "That is ... how does he drink?",
      "Drinks vodka, and it s bad for him.",
      "And a great deal?",
      "whispered Levin.",
      "Yes, she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where Nikolay Levin had reappeared.",
      "What were you talking about?",
      "he said, knitting his brows, and turning his scared eyes from one to the other.",
      "What was it?",
      "Oh, nothing, Konstantin answered in confusion.",
      "Oh, if you don t want to say, don t. Only it s no good your talking to her.",
      "She s a wench, and you re a gentleman, he said with a jerk of the neck.",
      "You understand everything, I see, and have taken stock of everything, and look with commiseration on my shortcomings, he began again, raising his voice.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch, whispered Marya Nikolaevna, again going up to him.",
      "Oh, very well, very well!...",
      "But where s the supper?",
      "Ah, here it is, he said, seeing a waiter with a tray.",
      "Here, set it here, he added angrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily.",
      "Like a drink?",
      "he turned to his brother, and at once became better humored.",
      "Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I m glad to see you, anyway.",
      "After all s said and done, we re not strangers.",
      "Come, have a drink.",
      "Tell me what you re doing, he went on, greedily munching a piece of bread, and pouring out another glassful.",
      "How are you living?",
      "I live alone in the country, as I used to.",
      "I m busy looking after the land, answered Konstantin, watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal that he noticed it.",
      "Why don t you get married?",
      "It hasn t happened so, Konstantin answered, reddening a little.",
      "For me now ... everything s at an end!",
      "I ve made a mess of my life.",
      "But this I ve said, and I say still, that if my share had been given me when I needed it, my whole life would have been different.",
      "Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.",
      "Do you know your little Vanya s with me, a clerk in the countinghouse at Pokrovskoe.",
      "Nikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.",
      "Yes, tell me what s going on at Pokrovskoe.",
      "Is the house standing still, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom?",
      "And Philip the gardener, is he living?",
      "How I remember the arbor and the seat!",
      "Now mind and don t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to be again.",
      "Then I ll come and see you, if your wife is nice.",
      "But come to me now, said Levin.",
      "How nicely we would arrange it!",
      "I d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "You wouldn t find him there.",
      "I live quite independently of him.",
      "Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and him, he said, looking timidly into his brother s face.",
      "This timidity touched Konstantin.",
      "If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side.",
      "You re both wrong.",
      "You re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.",
      "Ah, ah!",
      "You see that, you see that!",
      "Nikolay shouted joyfully.",
      "But I personally value friendly relations with you more because.... Why, why?",
      "Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was unhappy, and needed affection.",
      "But Nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.",
      "Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!",
      "said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching out her plump, bare arm towards the decanter.",
      "Let it be!",
      "Don t insist!",
      "I ll beat you!",
      "Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at once reflected on Nikolay s face, and she took the bottle.",
      "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
      "said Nikolay.",
      "She understands it all better than any of us.",
      "Isn t it true there s something good and sweet in her?",
      "Were you never before in Moscow?",
      "Konstantin said to her, for the sake of saying something.",
      "Only you mustn t be polite and stiff with her.",
      "It frightens her.",
      "No one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame.",
      "Mercy on us, the senselessness in the world!",
      "he cried suddenly.",
      "These new institutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what hideousness it all is!",
      "And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.",
      "Konstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was distasteful to him now from his brother s lips.",
      "In another world we shall understand it all, he said lightly.",
      "In another world!",
      "Ah, I don t like that other world!",
      "I don t like it, he said, letting his scared eyes rest on his brother s eyes.",
      "Here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one s own and other people s, would be a good thing, and yet I m afraid of death, awfully afraid of death.",
      "He shuddered.",
      "But do drink something.",
      "Would you like some champagne?",
      "Or shall we go somewhere?",
      "Let s go to the Gypsies!",
      "Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian songs.",
      "His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject to another.",
      "Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.",
      "Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade Nikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.",
      "Chapter 26 In the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he reached home.",
      "On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with himself, shame of something or other.",
      "But when he got out at his own station, when he saw his one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of his coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station fires, he saw his own sledge, his own horses with their tails tied up, in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman Ignat, as he put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the contractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved, he felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and self-dissatisfaction were passing away.",
      "He felt this at the mere sight of Ignat and the horses; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him, had sat down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village, and staring at the side-horse, that had been his saddle-horse, past his prime now, but a spirited beast from the Don, he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light.",
      "He felt himself, and did not want to be anyone else.",
      "All he wanted now was to be better than before.",
      "In the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had.",
      "Secondly, he would never again let himself give way to low passion, the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer.",
      "Then remembering his brother Nikolay, he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him, that he would follow him up, and not lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him.",
      "And that would be soon, he felt.",
      "Then, too, his brother s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly at the time, now made him think.",
      "He considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense.",
      "But he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still harder, and would allow himself even less luxury.",
      "And all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams.",
      "With a resolute feeling of hope in a new, better life, he reached home before nine o clock at night.",
      "The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house.",
      "She was not yet asleep.",
      "Kouzma, waked up by her, came sidling sleepily out onto the steps.",
      "A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and whining, turned round about Levin s knees, jumping up and longing, but not daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.",
      "You re soon back again, sir, said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "With friends, one is well; but at home, one is better, he answered, and went into his study.",
      "The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in.",
      "The familiar details came out: the stag s horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass, the stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his father s sofa, a large table, on the table an open book, a broken ashtray, a manuscript book with his handwriting.",
      "As he saw all this, there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on the road.",
      "All these traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say to him: No, you re not going to get away from us, and you re not going to be different, but you re going to be the same as you ve always been; with doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you won t get, and which isn t possible for you.",
      "This the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can do anything with oneself.",
      "And hearing that voice, he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them like a gymnast, trying to restore his confident temper.",
      "There was a creak of steps at the door.",
      "He hastily put down the dumbbells.",
      "The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched.",
      "This piece of news irritated Levin.",
      "The new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin.",
      "The bailiff had always been against the drying machine, and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched.",
      "Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for which he had hundreds of times given orders.",
      "He was annoyed, and reprimanded the bailiff.",
      "But there had been an important and joyful event: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had calved.",
      "Kouzma, give me my sheepskin.",
      "And you tell them to take a lantern.",
      "I ll come and look at her, he said to the bailiff.",
      "The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.",
      "Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went into the cowhouse.",
      "There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw.",
      "He caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka.",
      "Berkoot, the bull, was lying down with his ring in his lip, and seemed about to get up, but thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed by him.",
      "Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back turned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she sniffed her all over.",
      "Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long, tottering legs.",
      "Pava, uneasy, began lowing, but when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing heavily, began licking her with her rough tongue.",
      "The calf, fumbling, poked her nose under her mother s udder, and stiffened her tail out straight.",
      "Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way, said Levin, examining the calf.",
      "Like the mother!",
      "though the color takes after the father; but that s nothing.",
      "Very good.",
      "Long and broad in the haunch.",
      "Vassily Fedorovitch, isn t she splendid?",
      "he said to the bailiff, quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf.",
      "How could she fail to be?",
      "Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after you left.",
      "You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said the bailiff.",
      "I did inform you about the machine.",
      "This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his work on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated.",
      "He went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a little conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room.",
      "Chapter 27 The house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone, had the whole house heated and used.",
      "He knew that this was stupid, he knew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new plans, but this house was a whole world to Levin.",
      "It was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died.",
      "They had lived just the life that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.",
      "Levin scarcely remembered his mother.",
      "His conception of her was for him a sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been.",
      "He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family.",
      "His ideas of marriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life.",
      "For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on which its whole happiness turned.",
      "And now he had to give up that.",
      "When he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea, and had settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea Mihalovna had brought him tea, and with her usual, Well, I ll stay a while, sir, had taken a chair in the window, he felt that, however strange it might be, he had not parted from his daydreams, and that he could not live without them.",
      "Whether with her, or with another, still it would be.",
      "He was reading a book, and thinking of what he was reading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away without flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination.",
      "He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.",
      "He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty to God, and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been drinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he d half killed her.",
      "He listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading.",
      "It was Tyndall s _Treatise on Heat_.",
      "He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments, and for his lack of philosophic insight.",
      "And suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought: In two years time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot and the three others how lovely!",
      "He took up his book again.",
      "Very good, electricity and heat are the same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem?",
      "No.",
      "Well, then what of it?",
      "The connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively....",
      "It s particulary nice if Pava s daughter should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other three, too!",
      "Splendid!",
      "To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd.... My wife says, Kostya and I looked after that calf like a child.",
      "How can it interest you so much?",
      "says a visitor.",
      "Everything that interests him, interests me.",
      "But who will she be?",
      "And he remembered what had happened at Moscow.... Well, there s nothing to be done....",
      "It s not my fault.",
      "But now everything shall go on in a new way.",
      "It s nonsense to pretend that life won t let one, that the past won t let one.",
      "One must struggle to live better, much better.",
      "He raised his head, and fell to dreaming.",
      "Old Laska, who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard to bark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing in the scent of fresh air, put her head under his hand, and whined plaintively, asking to be stroked.",
      "There, who d have thought it?",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "The dog now ... why, she understands that her master s come home, and that he s low-spirited.",
      "Why low-spirited?",
      "Do you suppose I don t see it, sir?",
      "It s high time I should know the gentry.",
      "Why, I ve grown up from a little thing with them.",
      "It s nothing, sir, so long as there s health and a clear conscience.",
      "Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his thought.",
      "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
      "said she, and taking his cup she went out.",
      "Laska kept poking her head under his hand.",
      "He stroked her, and she promptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw.",
      "And in token of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a little, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose.",
      "Levin watched all her movements attentively.",
      "That s what I ll do, he said to himself; that s what I ll do!",
      "Nothing s amiss.... All s well.",
      "Chapter 28 After the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.",
      "No, I must go, I must go ; she explained to her sister-in-law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them: no, it had really better be today!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o clock.",
      "Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache.",
      "Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.",
      "Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute senses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now interested in them, but they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was going away.",
      "Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure.",
      "She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down her accounts, and packed.",
      "Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with herself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self.",
      "After dinner, Anna went up to her room to dress, and Dolly followed her.",
      "How queer you are today!",
      "Dolly said to her.",
      "I m not queer, but I m nasty.",
      "I am like that sometimes.",
      "I keep feeling as if I could cry.",
      "It s very stupid, but it ll pass off, said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs.",
      "Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually swimming with tears.",
      "In the same way I didn t want to leave Petersburg, and now I don t want to go away from here.",
      "You came here and did a good deed, said Dolly, looking intently at her.",
      "Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.",
      "Don t say that, Dolly.",
      "I ve done nothing, and could do nothing.",
      "I often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me.",
      "What have I done, and what could I do?",
      "In your heart there was found love enough to forgive....",
      "If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened!",
      "How happy you are, Anna!",
      "Everything is clear and good in your heart.",
      "Every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the English say.",
      "You have no sort of _skeleton_, have you?",
      "Everything is so clear in you.",
      "I have!",
      "said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a sly, ironical smile curved her lips.",
      "Come, he s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing, said Dolly, smiling.",
      "No, he s depressing.",
      "Do you know why I m going today instead of tomorrow?",
      "It s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to you, said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and looking straight into Dolly s face.",
      "And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her neck.",
      "Yes, Anna went on.",
      "Do you know why Kitty didn t come to dinner?",
      "She s jealous of me.",
      "I have spoiled ...",
      "I ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure.",
      "But truly, truly, it s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit, she said, daintily drawling the words a little bit.",
      "Oh, how like Stiva you said that!",
      "said Dolly, laughing.",
      "Anna was hurt.",
      "Oh no, oh no!",
      "I m not Stiva, she said, knitting her brows.",
      "That s why I m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself for an instant, said Anna.",
      "But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they were not true.",
      "She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at the thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant, simply to avoid meeting him.",
      "Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he.... You can t imagine how absurdly it all came about.",
      "I only meant to be matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently.",
      "Possibly against my own will.... She crimsoned and stopped.",
      "Oh, they feel it directly?",
      "But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side, Anna interrupted her.",
      "And I am certain it will all be forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.",
      "All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I m not very anxious for this marriage for Kitty.",
      "And it s better it should come to nothing, if he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.",
      "Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!",
      "said Anna, and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that absorbed her, put into words.",
      "And so here I am going away, having made an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much!",
      "Ah, how sweet she is!",
      "But you ll make it right, Dolly?",
      "Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile.",
      "She loved Anna, but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses.",
      "An enemy?",
      "That can t be.",
      "I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care for you more than ever, said Anna, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Ah, how silly I am today!",
      "She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.",
      "At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy and good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.",
      "Anna s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her sister-in-law for the last time, she whispered: Remember, Anna, what you ve done for me I shall never forget.",
      "And remember that I love you, and shall always love you as my dearest friend!",
      "I don t know why, said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.",
      "You understood me, and you understand.",
      "Good-bye, my darling!",
      "Chapter 29 Come, it s all over, and thank God!",
      "was the first thought that came to Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the last time to her brother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang.",
      "She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka, and looked about her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage.",
      "tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life will go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.",
      "Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day, Anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care.",
      "With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself comfortably.",
      "An invalid lady had already lain down to sleep.",
      "Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet, and made observations about the heating of the train.",
      "Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp, hooked it onto the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife and an English novel.",
      "At first her reading made no progress.",
      "The fuss and bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she could not help listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard passing by, covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention.",
      "Farther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same shaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same voices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she read.",
      "Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna read and understood, but it was distasteful to her to read, that is, to follow the reflection of other people s lives.",
      "She had too great a desire to live herself.",
      "If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man; if she read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she longed to be delivering the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary had ridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, and had surprised everyone by her boldness, she too wished to be doing the same.",
      "But there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the smooth paper-knife in her little hands, she forced herself to read.",
      "The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English happiness, a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate, when she suddenly felt that _he_ ought to feel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing.",
      "But what had he to be ashamed of?",
      "What have I to be ashamed of?",
      "she asked herself in injured surprise.",
      "She laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair, tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands.",
      "There was nothing.",
      "She went over all her Moscow recollections.",
      "All were good, pleasant.",
      "She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of slavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was nothing shameful.",
      "And for all that, at the same point in her memories, the feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just at the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her, Warm, very warm, hot.",
      "Well, what is it?",
      "she said to herself resolutely, shifting her seat in the lounge.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "Am I afraid to look it straight in the face?",
      "Can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance?",
      "She laughed contemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read.",
      "She passed the paper-knife over the window pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her.",
      "She felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg.",
      "She felt her eyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously, something within oppressing her breathing, while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed vividness.",
      "Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her, when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or were standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or a stranger.",
      "What s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some beast?",
      "And what am I myself?",
      "Myself or some other woman?",
      "She was afraid of giving way to this delirium.",
      "But something drew her towards it, and she could yield to it or resist it at will.",
      "She got up to rouse herself, and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress.",
      "For a moment she regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing from it, was the stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer, that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but then everything grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as though someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything.",
      "Anna felt as though she were sinking down.",
      "But it was not terrible, but delightful.",
      "The voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear.",
      "She got up and pulled herself together; she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard.",
      "She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.",
      "Do you wish to get out?",
      "asked Annushka.",
      "Yes, I want a little air.",
      "It s very hot in here.",
      "And she opened the door.",
      "The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door.",
      "But she enjoyed the struggle.",
      "She opened the door and went out.",
      "The wind seemed as though lying in wait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages.",
      "The wind had been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of the carriages, there was a lull.",
      "With enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station.",
      "Chapter 30 The raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station.",
      "The carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly covered.",
      "For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it.",
      "Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily together, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors.",
      "The bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron.",
      "Hand over that telegram!",
      "came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side.",
      "This way!",
      "28!",
      "several different voices shouted again, and muffled figures ran by covered with snow.",
      "Two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her.",
      "She drew one more deep breath of the fresh air, and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage, when another man in a military overcoat, quite close beside her, stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post.",
      "She looked round, and the same instant recognized Vronsky s face.",
      "Putting his hand to the peak of his cap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she wanted?",
      "Could he be of any service to her?",
      "She gazed rather a long while at him without answering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she saw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes.",
      "It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before.",
      "More than once she had told herself during the past few days, and again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly the same, that are met everywhere, that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him.",
      "But now at the first instant of meeting him, she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride.",
      "She had no need to ask why he had come.",
      "She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was.",
      "I didn t know you were going.",
      "What are you coming for?",
      "she said, letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post.",
      "And irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.",
      "What am I coming for?",
      "he repeated, looking straight into her eyes.",
      "You know that I have come to be where you are, he said; I can t help it.",
      "At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front, plaintively and gloomily.",
      "All the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now.",
      "He had said what her soul longed to hear, though she feared it with her reason.",
      "She made no answer, and in her face he saw conflict.",
      "Forgive me, if you dislike what I said, he said humbly.",
      "He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly, that for a long while she could make no answer.",
      "It s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you re a good man, to forget what you ve said, as I forget it, she said at last.",
      "Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever forget....",
      "Enough, enough!",
      "she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily.",
      "And clutching at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage.",
      "But in the little corridor she paused, going over in her imagination what had happened.",
      "Though she could not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she was panic-stricken and blissful at it.",
      "After standing still a few seconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her place.",
      "The overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension.",
      "She did not sleep all night.",
      "But in that nervous tension, and in the visions that filled her imagination, there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy: on the contrary there was something blissful, glowing, and exhilarating.",
      "Towards morning Anna sank into a doze, sitting in her place, and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near Petersburg.",
      "At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son, and the details of that day and the following came upon her.",
      "At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first person that attracted her attention was her husband.",
      "Oh, mercy!",
      "why do his ears look like that?",
      "she thought, looking at his frigid and imposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat.",
      "Catching sight of her, he came to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile, and his big, tired eyes looking straight at her.",
      "An unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance, as though she had expected to see him different.",
      "She was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him.",
      "That feeling was an intimate, familiar feeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in her relations with her husband.",
      "But hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling, now she was clearly and painfully aware of it.",
      "Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year after marriage, burned with impatience to see you, he said in his deliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always took with her, a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said.",
      "Is Seryozha quite well?",
      "And is this all the reward, said he, for my ardor?",
      "He s quite well.... Chapter 31 Vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night.",
      "He sat in his armchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out.",
      "If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he seemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever.",
      "He looked at people as if they were things.",
      "A nervous young man, a clerk in a law court, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look.",
      "The young man asked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even pushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a person.",
      "But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the young man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his self-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person.",
      "Vronsky saw nothing and no one.",
      "He felt himself a king, not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna he did not yet believe that, but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride.",
      "What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think.",
      "He felt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on one thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal.",
      "And he was happy at it.",
      "He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he had come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only meaning in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her.",
      "And when he got out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and caught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought.",
      "And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it now and was thinking of it.",
      "He did not sleep all night.",
      "When he was back in the carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his fancy, making his heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a possible future.",
      "When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath.",
      "He paused near his compartment, waiting for her to get out.",
      "Once more, he said to himself, smiling unconsciously, once more I shall see her walk, her face; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.",
      "But before he caught sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the station-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd.",
      "The husband.",
      "Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her, a husband.",
      "He knew that she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and only now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his legs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property.",
      "Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely self-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent spine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation, such as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring, should find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied the water.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s manner of walking, with a swing of the hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky.",
      "He could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her.",
      "But she was still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way, physically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with rapture.",
      "He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second class, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her.",
      "He saw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a lover s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband.",
      "No, she does not love him and cannot love him, he decided to himself.",
      "At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round, and seeing him, turned again to her husband.",
      "Have you passed a good night?",
      "he asked, bowing to her and her husband together, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.",
      "Thank you, very good, she answered.",
      "Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it, peeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she glanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and although the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment.",
      "She glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling who this was.",
      "Vronsky s composure and self-confidence here struck, like a scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Count Vronsky, said Anna.",
      "We are acquainted, I believe, said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, giving his hand.",
      "You set off with the mother and you return with the son, he said, articulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing.",
      "You re back from leave, I suppose?",
      "he said, and without waiting for a reply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone: Well, were a great many tears shed at Moscow at parting?",
      "By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched his hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "I hope I may have the honor of calling on you, he said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.",
      "Delighted, he said coldly.",
      "On Mondays we re at home.",
      "Most fortunate, he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether, that I should just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my devotion, he went on in the same jesting tone.",
      "You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much, she responded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the sound of Vronsky s steps behind them.",
      "But what has it to do with me?",
      "she said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had got on without her.",
      "Oh, capitally!",
      "Mariette says he has been very good, And ...",
      "I must disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has.",
      "But once more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day.",
      "Our dear _Samovar_ will be delighted.",
      "(He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well known in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with excitement.)",
      "She has been continually asking after you.",
      "And, do you know, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.",
      "You know how she takes everything to heart.",
      "Just now, with all her own cares, she s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together.",
      "The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband s, and the center of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which Anna was, through her husband, in the closest relations.",
      "But you know I wrote to her?",
      "Still she ll want to hear details.",
      "Go and see her, if you re not too tired, my dear.",
      "Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I go to my committee.",
      "I shall not be alone at dinner again, Alexey Alexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone.",
      "You wouldn t believe how I ve missed.... And with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile, he put her in her carriage.",
      "Chapter 32 The first person to meet Anna at home was her son.",
      "He dashed down the stairs to her, in spite of the governess s call, and with desperate joy shrieked: Mother!",
      "mother!",
      "Running up to her, he hung on her neck.",
      "I told you it was mother!",
      "he shouted to the governess.",
      "I knew!",
      "And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to disappointment.",
      "She had imagined him better than he was in reality.",
      "She had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was.",
      "But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up stockings.",
      "Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his simple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his na ve questions.",
      "Anna took out the presents Dolly s children had sent him, and told her son what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya could read, and even taught the other children.",
      "Why, am I not so nice as she?",
      "asked Seryozha.",
      "To me you re nicer than anyone in the world.",
      "I know that, said Seryozha, smiling.",
      "Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia Ivanovna was announced.",
      "The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes.",
      "Anna liked her, but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects.",
      "Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?",
      "inquired Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as soon as she came into the room.",
      "Yes, it s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had supposed, answered Anna.",
      "My _belle-s ur_ is in general too hasty.",
      "But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything that did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what interested her; she interrupted Anna: Yes, there s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world.",
      "I am so worried today.",
      "Oh, why?",
      "asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.",
      "I m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and sometimes I m quite unhinged by it.",
      "The Society of the Little Sisters (this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution) was going splendidly, but with these gentlemen it s impossible to do anything, added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny.",
      "They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and then work it out so pettily and unworthily.",
      "Two or three people, your husband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the others simply drag it down.",
      "Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me.... Pravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna described the purport of his letter.",
      "Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the Slavonic committee.",
      "It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn t notice it before?",
      "Anna asked herself.",
      "Or has she been very much irritated today?",
      "It s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a Christian, yet she s always angry; and she always has enemies, and always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.",
      "After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief secretary, who told her all the news of the town.",
      "At three o clock she too went away, promising to come to dinner.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was at the ministry.",
      "Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son s dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in putting her things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table.",
      "The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and her excitement, too, had completely vanished.",
      "In the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.",
      "She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day.",
      "Nothing.",
      "Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done.",
      "To speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question.",
      "To speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance.",
      "She remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband s subordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her and himself by jealousy.",
      "So then there s no reason to speak of it?",
      "And indeed, thank God, there s nothing to speak of, she told herself.",
      "Chapter 33 Alexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to her.",
      "He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions, and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary.",
      "At dinner time (there were always a few people dining with the Karenins) there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch, the chief secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who had been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service.",
      "Anna went into the drawing-room to receive these guests.",
      "Precisely at five o clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner.",
      "Every minute of Alexey Alexandrovitch s life was portioned out and occupied.",
      "And to make time to get through all that lay before him every day, he adhered to the strictest punctuality.",
      "Unhasting and unresting, was his motto.",
      "He came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and hurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife.",
      "Yes, my solitude is over.",
      "You wouldn t believe how uncomfortable (he laid stress on the word _uncomfortable_) it is to dine alone.",
      "At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and, with a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the conversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg official and public news.",
      "After dinner he spent half an hour with his guests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife s hand, withdrew, and drove off to the council.",
      "Anna did not go out that evening either to the Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had invited her, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening.",
      "She did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready.",
      "Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests, to the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed.",
      "She was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense, and before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform.",
      "The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before.",
      "It appeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other one had not been altered as Anna had intended.",
      "The dressmaker came to explain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards.",
      "To regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent the whole evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with the cross, and tucked him up.",
      "She was glad she had not gone out anywhere, and had spent the evening so well.",
      "She felt so light-hearted and serene, she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself.",
      "Anna sat down at the hearth with an English novel and waited for her husband.",
      "Exactly at half-past nine she heard his ring, and he came into the room.",
      "Here you are at last!",
      "she observed, holding out her hand to him.",
      "He kissed her hand and sat down beside her.",
      "Altogether then, I see your visit was a success, he said to her.",
      "Oh, yes, she said, and she began telling him about everything from the beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the accident at the station.",
      "Then she described the pity she had felt, first for her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.",
      "I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is your brother, said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.",
      "Anna smiled.",
      "She knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion.",
      "She knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.",
      "I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back again, he went on.",
      "Come, what do they say about the new act I have got passed in the council?",
      "Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance.",
      "Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation, he said, with a complacent smile.",
      "She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling it.",
      "With the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act he had passed.",
      "I was very, very glad.",
      "It shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.",
      "Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his study.",
      "And you ve not been anywhere this evening?",
      "You ve been dull, I expect?",
      "she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study.",
      "What are you reading now?",
      "Just now I m reading Duc de Lille, _Po sie des Enfers,_ he answered.",
      "A very remarkable book.",
      "Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and, putting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.",
      "She knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the evening.",
      "She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which swallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world.",
      "She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing with politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign to his nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it, Alexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art, but made it his duty to read everything.",
      "She knew that in politics, in philosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and made investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above all, of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had the most distinct and decided opinions.",
      "He was fond of talking about Shakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of poetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency.",
      "Well, God be with you, she said at the door of the study, where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.",
      "And I ll write to Moscow.",
      "He pressed her hand, and again kissed it.",
      "All the same he s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable in his own line, Anna said to herself going back to her room, as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him.",
      "But why is it his ears stick out so strangely?",
      "Or has he had his hair cut?",
      "Precisely at twelve o clock, when Anna was still sitting at her writing-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed and combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.",
      "It s time, it s time, said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into their bedroom.",
      "And what right had he to look at him like that?",
      "thought Anna, recalling Vronsky s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the eagerness which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in her, hidden somewhere far away.",
      "Chapter 34 When Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set of rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.",
      "Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and not merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt.",
      "Towards evening he was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers.",
      "On arriving at twelve o clock from the station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired carriage familiar to him.",
      "While still outside his own door, as he rang, he heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and Petritsky s voice.",
      "If that s one of the villains, don t let him in!",
      "Vronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped quietly into the first room.",
      "Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky s, with a rosy little face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and filling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat at the round table making coffee.",
      "Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the cavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from duty, were sitting each side of her.",
      "Bravo!",
      "Vronsky!",
      "shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his chair.",
      "Our host himself!",
      "Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot.",
      "Why, we didn t expect you!",
      "Hope you re satisfied with the ornament of your study, he said, indicating the baroness.",
      "You know each other, of course?",
      "I should think so, said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the baroness s little hand.",
      "What next!",
      "I m an old friend.",
      "You re home after a journey, said the baroness, so I m flying.",
      "Oh, I ll be off this minute, if I m in the way.",
      "You re home, wherever you are, baroness, said Vronsky.",
      "How do you do, Kamerovsky?",
      "he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.",
      "There, you never know how to say such pretty things, said the baroness, turning to Petritsky.",
      "No; what s that for?",
      "After dinner I say things quite as good.",
      "After dinner there s no credit in them?",
      "Well, then, I ll make you some coffee, so go and wash and get ready, said the baroness, sitting down again, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot.",
      "Pierre, give me the coffee, she said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called Pierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her relations with him.",
      "I ll put it in.",
      "You ll spoil it!",
      "No, I won t spoil it!",
      "Well, and your wife?",
      "said the baroness suddenly, interrupting Vronsky s conversation with his comrade.",
      "We ve been marrying you here.",
      "Have you brought your wife?",
      "No, baroness.",
      "I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.",
      "So much the better, so much the better.",
      "Shake hands on it.",
      "And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many jokes, about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.",
      "He persists in refusing to give me a divorce!",
      "Well, what am I to do?",
      "(_He_ was her husband.)",
      "Now I want to begin a suit against him.",
      "What do you advise?",
      "Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it s boiling over.",
      "You see, I m engrossed with business!",
      "I want a lawsuit, because I must have my property.",
      "Do you understand the folly of it, that on the pretext of my being unfaithful to him, she said contemptuously, he wants to get the benefit of my fortune.",
      "Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty woman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether dropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.",
      "In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed classes.",
      "One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all, ridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the one wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent, a woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one ought to bring up one s children, earn one s bread, and pay one s debts; and various similar absurdities.",
      "This was the class of old-fashioned and ridiculous people.",
      "But there was another class of people, the real people.",
      "To this class they all belonged, and in it the great thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon oneself without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything else.",
      "For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of a quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow.",
      "But immediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped back into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.",
      "The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and boiled away, doing just what was required of it that is, providing much cause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the baroness s gown.",
      "Well now, good-bye, or you ll never get washed, and I shall have on my conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit.",
      "So you would advise a knife to his throat?",
      "To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.",
      "He ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily, answered Vronsky.",
      "So at the Fran ais!",
      "and, with a rustle of her skirts, she vanished.",
      "Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook hands and went off to his dressing-room.",
      "While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his position, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg.",
      "No money at all.",
      "His father said he wouldn t give him any and pay his debts.",
      "His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow, too, was threatening to get him locked up.",
      "The colonel of the regiment had announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to leave.",
      "As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially since she d taken to offering continually to lend him money.",
      "But he had found a girl he d show her to Vronsky a marvel, exquisite, in the strict Oriental style, genre of the slave Rebecca, don t you know.",
      "He d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to him, but of course it would come to nothing.",
      "Altogether everything was supremely amusing and jolly.",
      "And, not letting his comrade enter into further details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all the interesting news.",
      "As he listened to Petritsky s familiar stories in the familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in, Vronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless Petersburg life that he was used to.",
      "Impossible!",
      "he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck.",
      "he cried, at the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to Mileev.",
      "And is he as stupid and pleased as ever?",
      "Well, and how s Buzulukov?",
      "Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov simply lovely!",
      "cried Petritsky.",
      "You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court ball.",
      "He went to a big ball in a new helmet.",
      "Have you seen the new helmets?",
      "Very nice, lighter.",
      "Well, so he s standing.... No, I say, do listen.",
      "I am listening, answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.",
      "Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new helmets.",
      "The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to the ambassador.",
      "They see our friend standing there.",
      "(Petritsky mimicked how he was standing with the helmet.)",
      "The Grand Duchess asked him to give her the helmet; he doesn t give it to her.",
      "What do you think of that?",
      "Well, everyone s winking at him, nodding, frowning give it to her, do!",
      "He doesn t give it to her.",
      "He s mute as a fish.",
      "Only picture it!...",
      "Well, the ... what s his name, whatever he was ... tries to take the helmet from him ... he won t give it up!...",
      "He pulls it from him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess.",
      "Here, your Highness, says he, is the new helmet.",
      "She turned the helmet the other side up, And just picture it!",
      "plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two pounds of sweetmeats!...",
      "He d been storing them up, the darling!",
      "Vronsky burst into roars of laughter.",
      "And long afterwards, when he was talking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing his strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.",
      "Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet, got into his uniform, and went off to report himself.",
      "He intended, when he had done that, to drive to his brother s and to Betsy s and to pay several visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where he might meet Madame Karenina.",
      "As he always did in Petersburg, he left home not meaning to return till late at night.",
      "PART TWO Chapter 1 At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys house, a consultation was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty s health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength.",
      "She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.",
      "The family doctor gave her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was called in.",
      "The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient.",
      "He maintained, with peculiar satisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of barbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still youngish to handle a young girl naked.",
      "He thought it natural because he did it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.",
      "There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor, in the princess s household and circle it was for some reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty.",
      "After a careful examination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame, the celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was standing in the drawing-room talking to the prince.",
      "The prince frowned and coughed, listening to the doctor.",
      "As a man who had seen something of life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in medicine, and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as he was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty s illness.",
      "Conceited blockhead!",
      "he thought, as he listened to the celebrated doctor s chatter about his daughter s symptoms.",
      "The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence.",
      "He perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.",
      "Before her he decided to scatter his pearls.",
      "At that instant the princess came into the drawing-room with the family doctor.",
      "The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance.",
      "The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.",
      "She felt she had sinned against Kitty.",
      "Well, doctor, decide our fate, said the princess.",
      "Tell me everything.",
      "Is there hope?",
      "she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could not utter the question.",
      "Well, doctor?",
      "Immediately, princess.",
      "I will talk it over with my colleague, and then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.",
      "So we had better leave you?",
      "As you please.",
      "The princess went out with a sigh.",
      "When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous trouble, but ... and so on.",
      "The celebrated doctor listened to him, and in the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.",
      "Yes, said he.",
      "But....",
      "The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.",
      "The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite.",
      "But we may suspect it.",
      "And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.",
      "The question stands thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?",
      "But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in these cases, the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile.",
      "Yes, that s an understood thing, responded the celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch.",
      "Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?",
      "it is.",
      "Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.",
      "So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.",
      "The one is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides at once.",
      "And how about a tour abroad?",
      "asked the family doctor.",
      "I ve no liking for foreign tours.",
      "And take note: if there is an early stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign tour will be of no use.",
      "What is wanted is means of improving nutrition, and not for lowering it.",
      "And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm.",
      "The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.",
      "But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.",
      "And then the mother wishes it, he added.",
      "Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go.",
      "Only, those German quacks are mischievous....",
      "They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let them go then.",
      "He glanced once more at his watch.",
      "time s up already, And he went to the door.",
      "The celebrated doctor announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.",
      "another examination!",
      "cried the mother, with horror.",
      "Oh, no, only a few details, princess.",
      "Come this way.",
      "And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing-room to Kitty.",
      "Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.",
      "When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.",
      "All her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!",
      "Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.",
      "Her heart was broken.",
      "Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders?",
      "But she could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered herself to blame.",
      "May I trouble you to sit down, princess?",
      "the celebrated doctor said to her.",
      "He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began asking her tiresome questions.",
      "She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.",
      "Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.",
      "This is the third time you ve asked me the same thing.",
      "The celebrated doctor did not take offense.",
      "Nervous irritability, he said to the princess, when Kitty had left the room.",
      "However, I had finished.... And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly harmless.",
      "At the question: Should they go abroad?",
      "the doctor plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.",
      "Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.",
      "It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.",
      "The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.",
      "She had often, almost always, to be pretending now.",
      "Really, I m quite well, mamma.",
      "But if you want to go abroad, let s go!",
      "she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour, she began talking of the preparations for the journey.",
      "Chapter 2 Soon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived.",
      "She knew that there was to be a consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her confinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of the winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she had left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty s fate, which was to be decided that day.",
      "Well, well?",
      "she said, coming into the drawing-room, without taking off her hat.",
      "You re all in good spirits.",
      "Good news, then?",
      "They tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that though the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it was utterly impossible to report what he had said.",
      "The only point of interest was that it was settled they should go abroad.",
      "Dolly could not help sighing.",
      "Her dearest friend, her sister, was going away.",
      "And her life was not a cheerful one.",
      "Her relations with Stepan Arkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating.",
      "The union Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and family harmony was breaking down again at the same point.",
      "There had been nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home; money, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually tortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried to dismiss, dreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already.",
      "The first onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back again, and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect her as it had the first time.",
      "Such a discovery now would only mean breaking up family habits, and she let herself be deceived, despising him and still more herself, for the weakness.",
      "Besides this, the care of her large family was a constant worry to her: first, the nursing of her young baby did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of the children had fallen ill. Well, how are all of you?",
      "asked her mother.",
      "Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own.",
      "Lili is ill, and I m afraid it s scarlatina.",
      "I have come here now to hear about Kitty, and then I shall shut myself up entirely, if God forbid it should be scarlatina.",
      "The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor s departure, and after presenting his cheek to Dolly, and saying a few words to her, he turned to his wife: How have you settled it?",
      "you re going?",
      "Well, and what do you mean to do with me?",
      "I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander, said his wife.",
      "That s as you like.",
      "Mamma, why shouldn t father come with us?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "It would be nicer for him and for us too.",
      "The old prince got up and stroked Kitty s hair.",
      "She lifted her head and looked at him with a forced smile.",
      "It always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone in the family, though he did not say much about her.",
      "Being the youngest, she was her father s favorite, and she fancied that his love gave him insight.",
      "When now her glance met his blue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw right through her, and understood all that was not good that was passing within her.",
      "Reddening, she stretched out towards him expecting a kiss, but he only patted her hair and said: These stupid chignons!",
      "There s no getting at the real daughter.",
      "One simply strokes the bristles of dead women.",
      "Well, Dolinka, he turned to his elder daughter, what s your young buck about, hey?",
      "Nothing, father, answered Dolly, understanding that her husband was meant.",
      "He s always out; I scarcely ever see him, she could not resist adding with a sarcastic smile.",
      "Why, hasn t he gone into the country yet to see about selling that forest?",
      "No, he s still getting ready for the journey.",
      "Oh, that s it!",
      "said the prince.",
      "And so am I to be getting ready for a journey too?",
      "At your service, he said to his wife, sitting down.",
      "And I tell you what, Katia, he went on to his younger daughter, you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I m quite well, and merry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the frost.",
      "Hey?",
      "What her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty became confused and overcome like a detected criminal.",
      "Yes, he sees it all, he understands it all, and in these words he s telling me that though I m ashamed, I must get over my shame.",
      "She could not pluck up spirit to make any answer.",
      "She tried to begin, and all at once burst into tears, and rushed out of the room.",
      "See what comes of your jokes!",
      "the princess pounced down on her husband.",
      "You re always.... she began a string of reproaches.",
      "The prince listened to the princess s scolding rather a long while without speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.",
      "She s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you don t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the cause of it.",
      "to be so mistaken in people!",
      "said the princess, and by the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was speaking of Vronsky.",
      "I don t know why there aren t laws against such base, dishonorable people.",
      "Ah, I can t bear to hear you!",
      "said the prince gloomily, getting up from his low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in the doorway.",
      "There are laws, madam, and since you ve challenged me to it, I ll tell you who s to blame for it all: you and you, you and nobody else.",
      "Laws against such young gallants there have always been, and there still are!",
      "Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to have been, old as I am, I d have called him out to the barrier, the young dandy.",
      "Yes, and now you physic her and call in these quacks.",
      "The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the princess heard his tone she subsided at once, and became penitent, as she always did on serious occasions.",
      "Alexander, Alexander, she whispered, moving to him and beginning to weep.",
      "As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down.",
      "He went up to her.",
      "There, that s enough, that s enough!",
      "You re wretched too, I know.",
      "It can t be helped.",
      "There s no great harm done.",
      "God is merciful ... thanks.... he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to the tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand.",
      "And the prince went out of the room.",
      "Before this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly, with her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a woman s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it.",
      "She took off her hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for action.",
      "While her mother was attacking her father, she tried to restrain her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow.",
      "During the prince s outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and tender towards her father for so quickly being kind again.",
      "But when her father left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful to go to Kitty and console her.",
      "I d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the last time?",
      "He told Stiva so.",
      "Well, what then?",
      "I don t understand....",
      "So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?...",
      "She didn t tell you so?",
      "No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she s too proud.",
      "But I know it s all on account of the other.",
      "Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn t have refused him if it hadn t been for the other, I know.",
      "And then, he has deceived her so horribly.",
      "It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against her daughter, and she broke out angrily.",
      "Oh, I really don t understand!",
      "Nowadays they will all go their own way, and mothers haven t a word to say in anything, and then.... Mamma, I ll go up to her.",
      "Well, do.",
      "Did I tell you not to?",
      "said her mother.",
      "Chapter 3 When she went into Kitty s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety.",
      "Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low chair near the door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug.",
      "Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered expression of her face did not change.",
      "I m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won t be able to come to see me, said Dolly, sitting down beside her.",
      "I want to talk to you.",
      "What about?",
      "Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.",
      "What should it be, but your trouble?",
      "I have no trouble.",
      "Nonsense, Kitty.",
      "Do you suppose I could help knowing?",
      "I know all about it.",
      "And believe me, it s of so little consequence.... We ve all been through it.",
      "Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.",
      "He s not worth your grieving over him, pursued Darya Alexandrovna, coming straight to the point.",
      "No, because he has treated me with contempt, said Kitty, in a breaking voice.",
      "Don t talk of it!",
      "Please, don t talk of it!",
      "But who can have told you so?",
      "No one has said that.",
      "I m certain he was in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it hadn t.... Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!",
      "shrieked Kitty, suddenly flying into a passion.",
      "She turned round on her chair, flushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of her belt first with one hand and then with the other.",
      "Dolly knew this trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited; she knew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and Dolly would have soothed her, but it was too late.",
      "What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?",
      "said Kitty quickly.",
      "That I ve been in love with a man who didn t care a straw for me, and that I m dying of love for him?",
      "And this is said to me by my own sister, who imagines that ... that ... that she s sympathizing with me!...",
      "I don t want these condolences and humbug!",
      "Kitty, you re unjust.",
      "Why are you tormenting me?",
      "But I ... quite the contrary ...",
      "I see you re unhappy....",
      "But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.",
      "I ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about.",
      "I am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.",
      "Yes, I don t say so either.... Only one thing.",
      "Tell me the truth, said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: tell me, did Levin speak to you?...",
      "The mention of Levin s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige of self-control.",
      "She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said: Why bring Levin in too?",
      "I can t understand what you want to torment me for.",
      "I ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and never, _never_ would I do as you re doing go back to a man who s deceived you, who has cared for another woman.",
      "I can t understand it!",
      "You may, but I can t!",
      "And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of the room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her face in her handkerchief.",
      "The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself.",
      "That humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it.",
      "She had not looked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her.",
      "But suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of heart-rending, smothered sobbing, and felt arms about her neck.",
      "Kitty was on her knees before her.",
      "Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!",
      "she whispered penitently.",
      "And the sweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna s skirt.",
      "As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each other.",
      "Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her.",
      "Dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out.",
      "She felt certain that her surmises were correct; that Kitty s misery, her inconsolable misery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer and she had refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky.",
      "Kitty said not a word of that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.",
      "I have nothing to make me miserable, she said, getting calmer; but can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse to me, and I myself most of all?",
      "You can t imagine what loathsome thoughts I have about everything.",
      "Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?",
      "asked Dolly, smiling.",
      "The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can t tell you.",
      "It s not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse.",
      "As though everything that was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most loathsome.",
      "Come, how am I to tell you?",
      "she went on, seeing the puzzled look in her sister s eyes.",
      "Father began saying something to me just now....",
      "It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married.",
      "Mother takes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married off as soon as may be, and be rid of me.",
      "I know it s not the truth, but I can t drive away such thoughts.",
      "Eligible suitors, as they call them I can t bear to see them.",
      "It seems to me they re taking stock of me and summing me up.",
      "In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward.",
      "And then!",
      "The doctor.... Then.... Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see him without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her imagination.",
      "Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most loathsome light, she went on.",
      "That s my illness.",
      "Perhaps it will pass off.",
      "But you mustn t think about it.",
      "I can t help it.",
      "I m never happy except with the children at your house.",
      "What a pity you can t be with me!",
      "Oh, yes, I m coming.",
      "I ve had scarlatina, and I ll persuade mamma to let me.",
      "Kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister s and nursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it turned out to be.",
      "The two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it, but Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent the Shtcherbatskys went abroad.",
      "Chapter 4 The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else.",
      "But this great set has its subdivisions.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society.",
      "One circle was her husband s government official set, consisting of his colleagues and subordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious manner, and belonging to different social strata.",
      "Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons.",
      "Now she knew all of them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them.",
      "She knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities, knew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and where they agreed and disagreed.",
      "But the circle of political, masculine interests had never interested her, in spite of countess Lidia Ivanovna s influence, and she avoided it.",
      "Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career.",
      "The center of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "It was a set made up of elderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and ambitious men.",
      "One of the clever people belonging to the set had called it the conscience of Petersburg society.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her special gift for getting on with everyone, had in the early days of her life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also.",
      "Now, since her return from Moscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable.",
      "It seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt so bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia Ivanovna as little as possible.",
      "The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable world the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses, the world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid sinking to the level of the demi-monde.",
      "For the demi-monde the members of that fashionable world believed that they despised, though their tastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical.",
      "Her connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya, her cousin s wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first came out, showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna s coterie.",
      "When I m old and ugly I ll be the same, Betsy used to say; but for a pretty young woman like you it s early days for that house of charity.",
      "Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya s world, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and besides in her heart she preferred the first circle.",
      "But since her visit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary.",
      "She avoided her serious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world.",
      "There she met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings.",
      "She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy s for Betsy was a Vronsky by birth and his cousin.",
      "Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of meeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his love.",
      "She gave him no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up in her heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time.",
      "She was conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this delight.",
      "At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her.",
      "Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at a _soir e_ where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him there, she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.",
      "The celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the fashionable world was in the theater.",
      "Vronsky, seeing his cousin from his stall in the front row, did not wait till the _entr acte_, but went to her box.",
      "Why didn t you come to dinner?",
      "she said to him.",
      "I marvel at the second sight of lovers, she added with a smile, so that no one but he could hear; _she wasn t there_.",
      "But come after the opera.",
      "Vronsky looked inquiringly at her.",
      "She nodded.",
      "He thanked her by a smile, and sat down beside her.",
      "But how I remember your jeers!",
      "continued Princess Betsy, who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.",
      "What s become of all that?",
      "You re caught, my dear boy.",
      "That s my one desire, to be caught, answered Vronsky, with his serene, good-humored smile.",
      "If I complain of anything it s only that I m not caught enough, to tell the truth.",
      "I begin to lose hope.",
      "Why, whatever hope can you have?",
      "said Betsy, offended on behalf of her friend.",
      "_Entendons nous...._ But in her eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have.",
      "None whatever, said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows of teeth.",
      "Excuse me, he added, taking an opera-glass out of her hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes facing them.",
      "I m afraid I m becoming ridiculous.",
      "He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people.",
      "He was very well aware that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or of any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous.",
      "But the position of a man pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand about it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera-glass and looked at his cousin.",
      "But why was it you didn t come to dinner?",
      "she said, admiring him.",
      "I must tell you about that.",
      "I was busily employed, and doing what, do you suppose?",
      "I ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you d never guess.",
      "I ve been reconciling a husband with a man who d insulted his wife.",
      "Yes, really!",
      "Well, did you succeed?",
      "Almost.",
      "You really must tell me about it, she said, getting up.",
      "Come to me in the next _entr acte._ I can t; I m going to the French theater.",
      "From Nilsson?",
      "Betsy queried in horror, though she could not herself have distinguished Nilsson s voice from any chorus girl s. Can t help it.",
      "I ve an appointment there, all to do with my mission of peace.",
      "Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven, said Betsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from someone.",
      "Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it s all about.",
      "And she sat down again.",
      "Chapter 5 This is rather indiscreet, but it s so good it s an awful temptation to tell the story, said Vronsky, looking at her with his laughing eyes.",
      "I m not going to mention any names.",
      "But I shall guess, so much the better.",
      "Well, listen: two festive young men were driving Officers of your regiment, of course?",
      "I didn t say they were officers, two young men who had been lunching.",
      "In other words, drinking.",
      "Possibly.",
      "They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the most festive state of mind.",
      "And they beheld a pretty woman in a hired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they fancy anyway, nods to them and laughs.",
      "They, of course, follow her.",
      "They gallop at full speed.",
      "To their amazement, the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going.",
      "The fair one darts upstairs to the top story.",
      "They get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil, and exquisite little feet.",
      "You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the two.",
      "And after what you said, just now!",
      "Well, the young men go in to their comrade s; he was giving a farewell dinner.",
      "There they certainly did drink a little too much, as one always does at farewell dinners.",
      "And at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house.",
      "No one knows; only their host s valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any young ladies are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great many of them about there.",
      "After dinner the two young men go into their host s study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one.",
      "They compose an ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter upstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not perfectly intelligible in the letter.",
      "Why are you telling me these horrible stories?",
      "Well?",
      "They ring.",
      "A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the letter, and assure the maid that they re both so in love that they ll die on the spot at the door.",
      "The maid, stupefied, carries in their messages.",
      "All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as a lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his wife, and sends them both about their business.",
      "How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?",
      "Ah, you shall hear.",
      "I ve just been to make peace between them.",
      "Well, and what then?",
      "That s the most interesting part of the story.",
      "It appears that it s a happy couple, a government clerk and his lady.",
      "The government clerk lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!...",
      "I assure you Talleyrand couldn t hold a candle to me.",
      "Why, where was the difficulty?",
      "Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding.",
      "The government clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too, desires to express his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express them, he begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again I m obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents.",
      "I allowed that their conduct was bad, but I urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness, their youth; then, too, the young men had only just been lunching together.",
      "You understand.",
      "They regret it deeply, and beg you to overlook their misbehavior.",
      "The government clerk was softened once more.",
      "I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but you perceive that my wife my wife s a respectable woman has been exposed to the persecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts, scoundrels.... And you must understand, the young upstarts are present all the while, and I have to keep the peace between them.",
      "Again I call out all my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an end, our friend the government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages stand on end with wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic wiles.",
      "Ah, he must tell you this story!",
      "said Betsy, laughing, to a lady who came into her box.",
      "He has been making me laugh so.",
      "Well, _bonne chance_!",
      "she added, giving Vronsky one finger of the hand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders she twitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up, so as to be duly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light of the gas, and the sight of all eyes.",
      "Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment, who never missed a single performance there.",
      "He wanted to see him, to report on the result of his mediation, which had occupied and amused him for the last three days.",
      "Petritsky, whom he liked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a capital fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the regiment, the young Prince Kedrov.",
      "And what was most important, the interests of the regiment were involved in it too.",
      "Both the young men were in Vronsky s company.",
      "The colonel of the regiment was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a complaint against his officers, who had insulted his wife.",
      "His young wife, so Venden told the story he had been married half a year was at church with her mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising from her interesting condition, she could not remain standing, she drove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she came across.",
      "On the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her; she was alarmed, and feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase home.",
      "Venden himself, on returning from his office, heard a ring at their bell and voices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he had turned them out.",
      "He asked for exemplary punishment.",
      "Yes, it s all very well, said the colonel to Vronsky, whom he had invited to come and see him.",
      "Petritsky s becoming impossible.",
      "Not a week goes by without some scandal.",
      "This government clerk won t let it drop, he ll go on with the thing.",
      "Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could be no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften the government clerk, and hush the matter up.",
      "The colonel had called in Vronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man, and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment.",
      "They talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with Vronsky to Venden s to apologize.",
      "The colonel and Vronsky were both fully aware that Vronsky s name and rank would be sure to contribute greatly to the softening of the injured husband s feelings.",
      "And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the result remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.",
      "On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel, and reported to him his success, or non-success.",
      "The colonel, thinking it all over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter further, but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine Vronsky about his interview; and it was a long while before he could restrain his laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk, after subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he recalled the details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of conciliation, skillfully man uvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out before him.",
      "It s a disgraceful story, but killing.",
      "Kedrov really can t fight the gentleman!",
      "Was he so awfully hot?",
      "he commented, laughing.",
      "But what do you say to Claire today?",
      "She s marvelous, he went on, speaking of a new French actress.",
      "However often you see her, every day she s different.",
      "It s only the French who can do that.",
      "Chapter 6 Princess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end of the last act.",
      "She had only just time to go into her dressing-room, sprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her dress to rights, and order tea in the big drawing-room, when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia.",
      "Her guests stepped out at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to read the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door, to the edification of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the immense door, letting the visitors pass by him into the house.",
      "Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other door of the drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white cloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea-things.",
      "The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves.",
      "Chairs were set with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the room; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing-room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows.",
      "In both groups conversation wavered, as it always does, for the first few minutes, broken up by meetings, greetings, offers of tea, and as it were, feeling about for something to rest upon.",
      "She s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she s studied Kaulbach, said a diplomatic attach in the group round the ambassador s wife.",
      "Did you notice how she fell down?...",
      "Oh, please, don t let us talk about Nilsson!",
      "No one can possibly say anything new about her, said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady, without eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress.",
      "This was Princess Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners, and nicknamed _enfant terrible_.",
      "Princess Myakaya, sitting in the middle between the two groups, and listening to both, took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other.",
      "Three people have used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as though they had made a compact about it.",
      "And I can t see why they liked that remark so.",
      "The conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject had to be thought of again.",
      "Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful, said the ambassador s wife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the English _small talk_.",
      "She addressed the attach , who was at a loss now what to begin upon.",
      "They say that that s a difficult task, that nothing s amusing that isn t spiteful, he began with a smile.",
      "But I ll try.",
      "Get me a subject.",
      "It all lies in the subject.",
      "If a subject s given me, it s easy to spin something round it.",
      "I often think that the celebrated talkers of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.",
      "Everything clever is so stale.... That has been said long ago, the ambassador s wife interrupted him, laughing.",
      "The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it came to a stop again.",
      "They had to have recourse to the sure, never-failing topic gossip.",
      "Don t you think there s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?",
      "he said, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing at the table.",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "He s in the same style as the drawing-room and that s why it is he s so often here.",
      "This conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say, of the relations of Tushkevitch with their hostess.",
      "Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile vacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the latest piece of public news, the theater, and scandal.",
      "It, too, came finally to rest on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.",
      "Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman the mother, not the daughter has ordered a costume in _diable rose_ color?",
      "Nonsense!",
      "No, that s too lovely!",
      "I wonder that with her sense for she s not a fool, you know that she doesn t see how funny she is.",
      "Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless Madame Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a burning faggot-stack.",
      "The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent collector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into the drawing-room before going to his club.",
      "Stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.",
      "How did you like Nilsson?",
      "Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that!",
      "How you startled me!",
      "she responded.",
      "Please don t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing about music.",
      "I d better meet you on your own ground, and talk about your majolica and engravings.",
      "Come now, what treasure have you been buying lately at the old curiosity shops?",
      "Would you like me to show you?",
      "But you don t understand such things.",
      "Oh, do show me!",
      "I ve been learning about them at those what s their names?...",
      "the bankers ... they ve some splendid engravings.",
      "They showed them to us.",
      "Why, have you been at the Sch tzburgs?",
      "asked the hostess from the samovar.",
      "Yes, _ma ch re_.",
      "They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told us the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds, Princess Myakaya said, speaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening; and very nasty sauce it was, some green mess.",
      "We had to ask them, and I made them sauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.",
      "I can t run to hundred-pound sauces.",
      "She s unique!",
      "said the lady of the house.",
      "Marvelous!",
      "said someone.",
      "The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya s speeches was always unique, and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said simple things with some sense in them.",
      "In the society in which she lived such plain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram.",
      "Princess Myakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she knew it had, and took advantage of it.",
      "As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the conversation around the ambassador s wife had dropped, Princess Betsy tried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the ambassador s wife.",
      "Will you really not have tea?",
      "You should come over here by us.",
      "No, we re very happy here, the ambassador s wife responded with a smile, and she went on with the conversation that had been begun.",
      "It was a very agreeable conversation.",
      "They were criticizing the Karenins, husband and wife.",
      "Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow.",
      "There s something strange about her, said her friend.",
      "The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of Alexey Vronsky, said the ambassador s wife.",
      "Well, what of it?",
      "There s a fable of Grimm s about a man without a shadow, a man who s lost his shadow.",
      "And that s his punishment for something.",
      "I never could understand how it was a punishment.",
      "But a woman must dislike being without a shadow.",
      "Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end, said Anna s friend.",
      "Bad luck to your tongue!",
      "said Princess Myakaya suddenly.",
      "Madame Karenina s a splendid woman.",
      "I don t like her husband, but I like her very much.",
      "Why don t you like her husband?",
      "He s such a remarkable man, said the ambassador s wife.",
      "My husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe.",
      "And my husband tells me just the same, but I don t believe it, said Princess Myakaya.",
      "If our husbands didn t talk to us, we should see the facts as they are.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking, is simply a fool.",
      "I say it in a whisper ... but doesn t it really make everything clear?",
      "Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept looking for his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but directly I said, _he s a fool,_ though only in a whisper, everything s explained, isn t it?",
      "How spiteful you are today!",
      "Not a bit.",
      "I d no other way out of it.",
      "One of the two had to be a fool.",
      "And, well, you know one can t say that of oneself.",
      "No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied with his wit.",
      "The attach repeated the French saying.",
      "That s just it, just it, Princess Myakaya turned to him.",
      "But the point is that I won t abandon Anna to your mercies.",
      "She s so nice, so charming.",
      "How can she help it if they re all in love with her, and follow her about like shadows?",
      "Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it, Anna s friend said in self-defense.",
      "If no one follows us about like a shadow, that s no proof that we ve any right to blame her.",
      "And having duly disposed of Anna s friend, the Princess Myakaya got up, and together with the ambassador s wife, joined the group at the table, where the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.",
      "What wicked gossip were you talking over there?",
      "asked Betsy.",
      "About the Karenins.",
      "The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey Alexandrovitch, said the ambassador s wife with a smile, as she sat down at the table.",
      "Pity we didn t hear it!",
      "said Princess Betsy, glancing towards the door.",
      "Ah, here you are at last!",
      "she said, turning with a smile to Vronsky, as he came in.",
      "Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one has only just parted.",
      "Where do I come from?",
      "he said, in answer to a question from the ambassador s wife.",
      "Well, there s no help for it, I must confess.",
      "From the _opera bouffe_.",
      "I do believe I ve seen it a hundred times, and always with fresh enjoyment.",
      "It s exquisite!",
      "I know it s disgraceful, but I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the _opera bouffe_ to the last minute, and enjoy it.",
      "This evening....",
      "He mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about her; but the ambassador s wife, with playful horror, cut him short.",
      "Please don t tell us about that horror.",
      "All right, I won t especially as everyone knows those horrors.",
      "And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing, like the opera, chimed in Princess Myakaya.",
      "Chapter 7 Steps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame Karenina, glanced at Vronsky.",
      "He was looking towards the door, and his face wore a strange new expression.",
      "Joyfully, intently, and at the same time timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he rose to his feet.",
      "Anna walked into the drawing-room.",
      "Holding herself extremely erect, as always, looking straight before her, and moving with her swift, resolute, and light step, that distinguished her from all other society women, she crossed the short space to her hostess, shook hands with her, smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her.",
      "She acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and frowned.",
      "But immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and shaking the hands proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy: I have been at Countess Lidia s, and meant to have come here earlier, but I stayed on.",
      "Sir John was there.",
      "He s very interesting.",
      "Oh, that s this missionary?",
      "Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting things.",
      "The conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out.",
      "Sir John!",
      "Yes, Sir John; I ve seen him.",
      "He speaks well.",
      "The Vlassieva girl s quite in love with him.",
      "And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl s to marry Topov?",
      "Yes, they say it s quite a settled thing.",
      "I wonder at the parents!",
      "They say it s a marriage for love.",
      "For love?",
      "What antediluvian notions you have!",
      "Can one talk of love in these days?",
      "said the ambassador s wife.",
      "It s a foolish old fashion that s kept up still, said Vronsky.",
      "So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion.",
      "The only happy marriages I know are marriages of prudence.",
      "Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have refused to recognize, said Vronsky.",
      "But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already.",
      "That s like scarlatina one has to go through it and get it over.",
      "Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.",
      "I was in love in my young days with a deacon, said the Princess Myakaya.",
      "I don t know that it did me any good.",
      "No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes and then correct them, said Princess Betsy.",
      "Even after marriage?",
      "said the ambassador s wife playfully.",
      "It s never too late to mend.",
      "The attach repeated the English proverb.",
      "Just so, Betsy agreed; one must make mistakes and correct them.",
      "What do you think about it?",
      "she turned to Anna, who, with a faintly perceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening in silence to the conversation.",
      "I think, said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken off, I think ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so many kinds of love.",
      "Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what she would say.",
      "He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered these words.",
      "Anna suddenly turned to him.",
      "Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow.",
      "They write me that Kitty Shtcherbatskaya s very ill. Really?",
      "said Vronsky, knitting his brows.",
      "Anna looked sternly at him.",
      "That doesn t interest you?",
      "On the contrary, it does, very much.",
      "What was it exactly they told you, if I may know?",
      "he questioned.",
      "Anna got up and went to Betsy.",
      "Give me a cup of tea, she said, standing at her table.",
      "While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.",
      "What is it they write to you?",
      "he repeated.",
      "I often think men have no understanding of what s not honorable though they re always talking of it, said Anna, without answering him.",
      "I ve wanted to tell you so a long while, she added, and moving a few steps away, she sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums.",
      "I don t quite understand the meaning of your words, he said, handing her the cup.",
      "She glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.",
      "Yes, I have been wanting to tell you, she said, not looking at him.",
      "You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.",
      "Do you suppose I don t know that I ve acted wrongly?",
      "But who was the cause of my doing so?",
      "What do you say that to me for?",
      "she said, glancing severely at him.",
      "You know what for, he answered boldly and joyfully, meeting her glance and not dropping his eyes.",
      "Not he, but she, was confused.",
      "That only shows you have no heart, she said.",
      "But her eyes said that she knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid of him.",
      "What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.",
      "Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful word, said Anna, with a shudder.",
      "But at once she felt that by that very word forbidden she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him, and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love.",
      "I have long meant to tell you this, she went on, looking resolutely into his eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on her cheeks.",
      "I ve come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet you.",
      "I have come to tell you that this must end.",
      "I have never blushed before anyone, and you force me to feel to blame for something.",
      "He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.",
      "What do you wish of me?",
      "he said simply and seriously.",
      "I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty s forgiveness, she said.",
      "You don t wish that?",
      "He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she wanted to say.",
      "If you love me, as you say, she whispered, do so that I may be at peace.",
      "His face grew radiant.",
      "Don t you know that you re all my life to me?",
      "But I know no peace, and I can t give it to you; all myself and love ... yes.",
      "I can t think of you and myself apart.",
      "You and I are one to me.",
      "And I see no chance before us of peace for me or for you.",
      "I see a chance of despair, of wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss, what bliss!...",
      "Can it be there s no chance of it?",
      "he murmured with his lips; but she heard.",
      "She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said.",
      "But instead of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of love, and made no answer.",
      "It s come!",
      "he thought in ecstasy.",
      "When I was beginning to despair, and it seemed there would be no end it s come!",
      "She loves me!",
      "She owns it!",
      "Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be friends, she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently.",
      "Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself.",
      "Whether we shall be the happiest or the wretchedest of people that s in your hands.",
      "She would have said something, but he interrupted her.",
      "I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.",
      "But if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I disappear.",
      "You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.",
      "I don t want to drive you away.",
      "Only don t change anything, leave everything as it is, he said in a shaky voice.",
      "Here s your husband.",
      "At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room with his calm, awkward gait.",
      "Glancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of the house, and sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his deliberate, always audible voice, in his habitual tone of banter, ridiculing someone.",
      "Your Rambouillet is in full conclave, he said, looking round at all the party; the graces and the muses.",
      "But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering, as she called it, using the English word, and like a skillful hostess she at once brought him into a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately interested in the subject, and began seriously defending the new imperial decree against Princess Betsy, who had attacked it.",
      "Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.",
      "This is getting indecorous, whispered one lady, with an expressive glance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her husband.",
      "What did I tell you?",
      "said Anna s friend.",
      "But not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the Princess Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle, as though that were a disturbing fact.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only person who did not once look in that direction, and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon.",
      "Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone, Princess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and went up to Anna.",
      "I m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband s language, she said.",
      "The most transcendental ideas seem to be within my grasp when he s speaking.",
      "said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and not understanding a word of what Betsy had said.",
      "She crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together.",
      "But she answered, not looking at him, that she was staying to supper.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch made his bows and withdrew.",
      "The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina s coachman, was with difficulty holding one of her pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance.",
      "A footman stood opening the carriage door.",
      "The hall-porter stood holding open the great door of the house.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, with her quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her sleeve, caught in the hook of her fur cloak, and with bent head listening to the words Vronsky murmured as he escorted her down.",
      "You ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing, he was saying; but you know that friendship s not what I want: that there s only one happiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so ... yes, love!...",
      "Love, she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at the very instant she unhooked the lace, she added, Why I don t like the word is that it means too much to me, far more than you can understand, and she glanced into his face.",
      "_Au revoir!_ She gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage.",
      "Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame.",
      "He kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the last two months.",
      "Chapter 8 Alexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager conversation with him about something.",
      "But he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared something striking and improper, and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper.",
      "He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife.",
      "On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually did, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at the place where he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one o clock, just as he usually did.",
      "But from time to time he rubbed his high forehead and shook his head, as though to drive away something.",
      "At his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna had not yet come in.",
      "With a book under his arm he went upstairs.",
      "But this evening, instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details, his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her.",
      "Contrary to his usual habit, he did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back.",
      "He could not go to bed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the position that had just arisen.",
      "When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to his wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter.",
      "But now, when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself, it seemed to him very complicated and difficult.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous.",
      "Jealousy according to his notions was an insult to one s wife, and one ought to have confidence in one s wife.",
      "Why one ought to have confidence that is to say, complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself.",
      "But he had no experience of lack of confidence, because he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to have it.",
      "Now, though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational, and did not know what was to be done.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife s loving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself.",
      "All his life Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres, having to do with the reflection of life.",
      "And every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it.",
      "Now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm below.",
      "That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived.",
      "For the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife s loving someone else, and he was horrified at it.",
      "He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning, over the carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and across her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits of her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her writing-table, that he knew so well.",
      "He walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door, and turned back again.",
      "At each turn in his walk, especially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he halted and said to himself, Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must express my view of it and my decision.",
      "And he turned back again.",
      "But express what what decision?",
      "he said to himself in the drawing-room, and he found no reply.",
      "But after all, he asked himself before turning into the boudoir, what has occurred?",
      "She was talking a long while with him.",
      "But what of that?",
      "Surely women in society can talk to whom they please.",
      "And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and her, he told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum, which had always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and no meaning at all.",
      "And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he entered the dark drawing-room some inner voice told him that it was not so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something.",
      "And he said to himself again in the dining-room, Yes, I must decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it.... And again at the turn in the drawing-room he asked himself, Decide how?",
      "And again he asked himself, What had occurred?",
      "and answered, Nothing, and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced that something had happened.",
      "His thoughts, like his body, went round a complete circle, without coming upon anything new.",
      "He noticed this, rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her boudoir.",
      "There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed.",
      "He began to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling.",
      "For the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas, her desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it.",
      "It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into.",
      "To put himself in thought and feeling in another person s place was a spiritual exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He looked on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.",
      "And the worst of it all, thought he, is that just now, at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion (he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time), when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me.",
      "I m not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them.",
      "I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind, he said aloud.",
      "The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in her soul, that s not my affair; that s the affair of her conscience, and falls under the head of religion, he said to himself, feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.",
      "And so, Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, questions as to her feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can have nothing to do.",
      "My duty is clearly defined.",
      "As the head of the family, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I perceive, to warn her, even to use my authority.",
      "I ought to speak plainly to her.",
      "And everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch s head.",
      "Thinking over what he would say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report.",
      "I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly, exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be, reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly, reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.",
      "And, interlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the joints of the fingers cracked.",
      "This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of his fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, so needful to him at this juncture.",
      "There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.",
      "A woman s step was heard mounting the stairs.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, ready for his speech, stood compressing his crossed fingers, waiting to see if the crack would not come again.",
      "One joint cracked.",
      "Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that she was close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt frightened of the explanation confronting him.... Chapter 9 Anna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood.",
      "Her face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of brightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night.",
      "On seeing her husband, Anna raised her head and smiled, as though she had just waked up.",
      "You re not in bed?",
      "What a wonder!",
      "she said, letting fall her hood, and without stopping, she went on into the dressing-room.",
      "It s late, Alexey Alexandrovitch, she said, when she had gone through the doorway.",
      "Anna, it s necessary for me to have a talk with you.",
      "With me?",
      "she said, wonderingly.",
      "She came out from behind the door of the dressing-room, and looked at him.",
      "she asked, sitting down.",
      "Well, let s talk, if it s so necessary.",
      "But it would be better to get to sleep.",
      "Anna said what came to her lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her own capacity for lying.",
      "How simple and natural were her words, and how likely that she was simply sleepy!",
      "She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood.",
      "She felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her.",
      "Anna, I must warn you, he began.",
      "Warn me?",
      "Of what?",
      "She looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural, either in the sound or the sense of her words.",
      "But to him, knowing her, knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she noticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy, every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once; to him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind, that she did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.",
      "He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had always hitherto lain open before him, were closed against him.",
      "More than that, he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were said straight out to him: Yes, it s shut up, and so it must be, and will be in future.",
      "Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have, returning home and finding his own house locked up.",
      "But perhaps the key may yet be found, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I want to warn you, he said in a low voice, that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society.",
      "Your too animated conversation this evening with Count Vronsky (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis) attracted attention.",
      "He talked and looked at her laughing eyes, which frightened him now with their impenetrable look, and, as he talked, he felt all the uselessness and idleness of his words.",
      "You re always like that, she answered, as though completely misapprehending him, and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase.",
      "One time you don t like my being dull, and another time you don t like my being lively.",
      "I wasn t dull.",
      "Does that offend you?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his hands to make the joints crack.",
      "Oh, please, don t do that, I do so dislike it, she said.",
      "Anna, is this you?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly making an effort over himself, and restraining the motion of his fingers.",
      "But what is it all about?",
      "she said, with such genuine and droll wonder.",
      "What do you want of me?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his forehead and his eyes.",
      "He saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say, warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience, and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between them.",
      "This is what I meant to say to you, he went on coldly and composedly, and I beg you to listen to it.",
      "I consider jealousy, as you know, a humiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be influenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot be disregarded with impunity.",
      "This evening it was not I observed it, but judging by the impression made on the company, everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be desired.",
      "I positively don t understand, said Anna, shrugging her shoulders He doesn t care, she thought.",
      "But other people noticed it, and that s what upsets him.",
      "You re not well, Alexey Alexandrovitch, she added, and she got up, and would have gone towards the door; but he moved forward as though he would stop her.",
      "His face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him.",
      "She stopped, and bending her head back and on one side, began with her rapid hand taking out her hairpins.",
      "Well, I m listening to what s to come, she said, calmly and ironically; and indeed I listen with interest, for I should like to understand what s the matter.",
      "She spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in which she was speaking, and the choice of the words she used.",
      "To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and besides, I regard that as useless and even harmful, began Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Ferreting in one s soul, one often ferrets out something that might have lain there unnoticed.",
      "Your feelings are an affair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to myself, and to God, to point out to you your duties.",
      "Our life has been joined, not by man, but by God.",
      "That union can only be severed by a crime, and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement.",
      "I don t understand a word.",
      "And, oh dear!",
      "how sleepy I am, unluckily, she said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair, feeling for the remaining hairpins.",
      "Anna, for God s sake don t speak like that!",
      "he said gently.",
      "Perhaps I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as for you.",
      "I am your husband, and I love you.",
      "For an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away; but the word _love_ threw her into revolt again.",
      "She thought: Love?",
      "Can he love?",
      "If he hadn t heard there was such a thing as love, he would never have used the word.",
      "He doesn t even know what love is.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don t understand, she said.",
      "Define what it is you find....",
      "Pardon, let me say all I have to say.",
      "I love you.",
      "But I am not speaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself.",
      "It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression.",
      "In that case, I beg you to forgive me.",
      "But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your heart prompts you, to speak out to me.... Alexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared.",
      "I have nothing to say.",
      "And besides, she said hurriedly, with difficulty repressing a smile, it s really time to be in bed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the bedroom.",
      "When she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed.",
      "His lips were sternly compressed, and his eyes looked away from her.",
      "Anna got into her bed, and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again.",
      "She both feared his speaking and wished for it.",
      "But he was silent.",
      "She waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten about him.",
      "She thought of that other; she pictured him, and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him.",
      "Suddenly she heard an even, tranquil snore.",
      "For the first instant Alexey Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his own snoring, and ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded again, with a new tranquil rhythm.",
      "It s late, it s late, she whispered with a smile.",
      "A long while she lay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness.",
      "Chapter 10 From that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his wife.",
      "Nothing special happened.",
      "Anna went out into society, as she had always done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy s, and met Vronsky everywhere.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do nothing.",
      "All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate, made up of a sort of amused perplexity.",
      "Outwardly everything was the same, but their inner relations were completely changed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, a man of great power in the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this.",
      "Like an ox with head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he felt was lifted over him.",
      "Every time he began to think about it, he felt that he must try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was still hope of saving her, of bringing her back to herself, and every day he made ready to talk to her.",
      "But every time he began talking to her, he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which had taken possession of her, had possession of him too, and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant to talk.",
      "Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at anyone who should say what he was saying.",
      "And in that tone it was impossible to say what needed to be said to her.",
      "Chapter 11 That which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna had been an impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more entrancing dream of bliss, that desire had been fulfilled.",
      "He stood before her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, and besought her to be calm, not knowing how or why.",
      "Anna!",
      "he said with a choking voice, Anna, for pity s sake!...",
      "But the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay, now shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting, down on the floor, at his feet; she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her.",
      "Forgive me!",
      "she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her bosom.",
      "She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in her life but him, to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness.",
      "Looking at him, she had a physical sense of her humiliation, and she could say nothing more.",
      "He felt what a murderer must feel, when he sees the body he has robbed of life.",
      "That body, robbed by him of life, was their love, the first stage of their love.",
      "There was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame.",
      "Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him.",
      "But in spite of all the murderer s horror before the body of his victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what he has gained by his murder.",
      "And with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body, and drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses.",
      "She held his hand, and did not stir.",
      "Yes, these kisses that is what has been bought by this shame.",
      "Yes, and one hand, which will always be mine the hand of my accomplice.",
      "She lifted up that hand and kissed it.",
      "He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid it, and said nothing.",
      "At last, as though making an effort over herself, she got up and pushed him away.",
      "Her face was still as beautiful, but it was only the more pitiful for that.",
      "All is over, she said; I have nothing but you.",
      "Remember that.",
      "I can never forget what is my whole life.",
      "For one instant of this happiness.... Happiness!",
      "she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him.",
      "For pity s sake, not a word, not a word more.",
      "She rose quickly and moved away from him.",
      "Not a word more, she repeated, and with a look of chill despair, incomprehensible to him, she parted from him.",
      "She felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words.",
      "But later too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul.",
      "She said to herself: No, just now I can t think of it, later on, when I am calmer.",
      "But this calm for thought never came; every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her, and what she ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away.",
      "Later, later, she said when I am calmer.",
      "But in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness.",
      "One dream haunted her almost every night.",
      "She dreamed that both were her husbands at once, that both were lavishing caresses on her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was weeping, kissing her hands, and saying, How happy we are now!",
      "And Alexey Vronsky was there too, and he too was her husband.",
      "And she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her, was explaining to them, laughing, that this was ever so much simpler, and that now both of them were happy and contented.",
      "But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare, and she awoke from it in terror.",
      "Chapter 12 In the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he said to himself: This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not get my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my sister s that was entrusted to me.",
      "And yet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much.",
      "It will be the same thing too with this trouble.",
      "Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.",
      "But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it; and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days.",
      "He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and was further than ever from marriage.",
      "He was painfully conscious himself, as were all about him, that at his years it is not well for man to be alone.",
      "He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had once said to his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he liked talking to: Well, Nikolay!",
      "I mean to get married, and how Nikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt: And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "But marriage had now become further off than ever.",
      "The place was taken, and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place, he felt that it was utterly impossible.",
      "Moreover, the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame.",
      "However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind, made him twinge and blush.",
      "There had been in his past, as in every man s, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences.",
      "These wounds never healed.",
      "And with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening.",
      "But time and work did their part.",
      "Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents paltry in his eyes, but really important of his country life.",
      "Every week he thought less often of Kitty.",
      "He was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married, hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.",
      "Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and treacheries of spring, one of those rare springs in which plants, beasts, and man rejoice alike.",
      "This lovely spring roused Levin still more, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently.",
      "Though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out, still his most important resolution that of purity had been kept by him.",
      "He was free from that shame, which had usually harassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the face.",
      "In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling him that his brother Nikolay s health was getting worse, but that he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin went to Moscow to his brother s and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad.",
      "He succeeded so well in persuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that matter.",
      "In addition to his farming, which called for special attention in spring, and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the data of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a certain unalterable character of the laborer.",
      "Thus, in spite of his solitude, or in consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly full.",
      "Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "With her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of agriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna s favorite subject.",
      "Spring was slow in unfolding.",
      "For the last few weeks it had been steadily fine frosty weather.",
      "In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but at night there were even seven degrees of frost.",
      "There was such a frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads.",
      "Easter came in the snow.",
      "Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams.",
      "On Thursday the wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature.",
      "Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and floating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the following Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had come.",
      "In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth.",
      "The old grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the sticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.",
      "Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls.",
      "The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers.",
      "Nimble children ran about the drying paths, covered with the prints of bare feet.",
      "There was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the yard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows.",
      "The real spring had come.",
      "Chapter 13 Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket, instead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.",
      "Spring is the time of plans and projects.",
      "And, as he came out into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds, hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him.",
      "But he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects.",
      "First of all he went to the cattle.",
      "The cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides were already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow.",
      "Levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and the calves to be let into the paddock.",
      "The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow.",
      "The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.",
      "After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a peasant s cow, and Pava s daughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the paddock.",
      "But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during the winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken.",
      "He sent for the carpenter, who, according to his orders, ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine.",
      "But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.",
      "This was very annoying to Levin.",
      "It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years.",
      "The hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart-horses stable; and there broken, as they were of light construction, only meant for feeding calves.",
      "Moreover, it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field.",
      "Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him.",
      "The bailiff, beaming all over, like everyone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.",
      "Why isn t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?",
      "Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.",
      "Here it s time they got to work in the fields.",
      "But what were they doing in the winter, then?",
      "But what did you want the carpenter for?",
      "Where are the hurdles for the calves paddock?",
      "I ordered them to be got ready.",
      "What would you have with those peasants!",
      "said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.",
      "It s not those peasants but this bailiff!",
      "said Levin, getting angry.",
      "Why, what do I keep you for?",
      "he cried.",
      "But, bethinking himself that this would not help matters, he stopped short in the middle of a sentence, and merely sighed.",
      "Can sowing begin?",
      "he asked, after a pause.",
      "Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.",
      "And the clover?",
      "I ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they re sowing.",
      "Only I don t know if they ll manage to get through; it s so slushy.",
      "How many acres?",
      "About fifteen.",
      "Why not sow all?",
      "That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the forty-five, was still more annoying to him.",
      "Clover, as he knew, both from books and from his own experience, never did well except when it was sown as early as possible, almost in the snow.",
      "And yet Levin could never get this done.",
      "There s no one to send.",
      "What would you have with such a set of peasants?",
      "Three haven t turned up.",
      "And there s Semyon.... Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.",
      "And so I have, as it is.",
      "Where are the peasants, then?",
      "Five are making comp te (which meant compost), four are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "Levin knew very well that a touch of mildew meant that his English seed oats were already ruined.",
      "Again they had not done as he had ordered.",
      "Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes, he cried.",
      "Don t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.",
      "Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the oats, and then to the stable.",
      "The oats were not yet spoiled.",
      "But the peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be done, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got over his vexation with the bailiff.",
      "Indeed, it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry.",
      "Ignat!",
      "he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked up, was washing the carriage wheels, saddle me....",
      "Which, sir?",
      "Well, let it be Kolpik.",
      "While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff, who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began talking to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans for the farm.",
      "The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done before the early mowing.",
      "And the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow.",
      "And the mowing to be all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.",
      "The bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer s projects.",
      "But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency.",
      "That look said: That s all very well, but as God wills.",
      "Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone.",
      "But it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had.",
      "They had all taken up that attitude to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but mortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it seemed, elemental force continually ranged against him, for which he could find no other expression than as God wills.",
      "If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said the bailiff.",
      "Why ever shouldn t you manage it?",
      "We positively must have another fifteen laborers.",
      "And they don t turn up.",
      "There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.",
      "Levin was silent.",
      "Again he was brought face to face with that opposing force.",
      "He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more than forty thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight laborers for a reasonable sum.",
      "Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.",
      "But still he could not help struggling against it.",
      "Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don t come we must look for them.",
      "Oh, I ll send, to be sure, said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.",
      "But there are the horses, too, they re not good for much.",
      "We ll get some more.",
      "I know, of course, Levin added laughing, you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but this year I m not going to let you have things your own way.",
      "I ll see to everything myself.",
      "Why, I don t think you take much rest as it is.",
      "It cheers us up to work under the master s eye....",
      "So they re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale?",
      "I ll go and have a look at them, he said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik, who was led up by the coachman.",
      "You can t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, the coachman shouted.",
      "All right, I ll go by the forest.",
      "And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance.",
      "If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country.",
      "Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he rode through his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.",
      "When he came out of the forest, in the immense plain before him, his grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow.",
      "He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a peasant he met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked, Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?",
      "We must get the ploughing done first, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, answered Ipat.",
      "The further he rode, the happier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.",
      "And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.",
      "Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so as not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover.",
      "A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse.",
      "Both the laborers were sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together.",
      "The earth in the cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods.",
      "Seeing the master, the laborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work sowing.",
      "This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his temper.",
      "When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge.",
      "It s all right, sir, it ll spring up again, responded Vassily.",
      "Please don t argue, said Levin, but do as you re told.",
      "Yes, sir, answered Vassily, and he took the horse s head.",
      "What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, he said, hesitating; first rate.",
      "Only it s a work to get about!",
      "You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.",
      "Why is it you have earth that s not sifted?",
      "said Levin.",
      "Well, we crumble it up, answered Vassily, taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms.",
      "Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with unsifted earth, but still it was annoying.",
      "Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that way now.",
      "He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.",
      "Where did you stop?",
      "Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as best he could, scattering the seed on the land.",
      "Walking was as difficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.",
      "Well, master, when summer s here, mind you don t scold me for these rows, said Vassily.",
      "said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his method.",
      "Why, you ll see in the summer time.",
      "It ll look different.",
      "Look you where I sowed last spring.",
      "How I did work at it!",
      "I do my best, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, d ye see, as I would for my own father.",
      "I don t like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it.",
      "What s good for the master s good for us too.",
      "To look out yonder now, said Vassily, pointing, it does one s heart good.",
      "It s a lovely spring, Vassily.",
      "Why, it s a spring such as the old men don t remember the like of.",
      "I was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of it.",
      "He was saying you wouldn t know it from rye.",
      "Have you been sowing wheat long?",
      "Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last.",
      "You gave me two measures.",
      "We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.",
      "Well, mind you crumble up the clods, said Levin, going towards his horse, and keep an eye on Mishka.",
      "And if there s a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every acre.",
      "Humbly thankful.",
      "We are very well content, sir, as it is.",
      "Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year s clover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn.",
      "The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent.",
      "It had survived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last year s wheat.",
      "The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.",
      "Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank deep in at each step.",
      "The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing.",
      "Everything was capital, everything was cheering.",
      "Levin rode back across the streams, hoping the water would have gone down.",
      "And he did in fact get across, and startled two ducks.",
      "There must be snipe too, he thought, and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper, who confirmed his theory about the snipe.",
      "Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening.",
      "Chapter 14 As he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.",
      "Yes, that s someone from the railway station, he thought, just the time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be?",
      "What if it s brother Nikolay?",
      "He did say: Maybe I ll go to the waters, or maybe I ll come down to you.",
      "He felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute, that his brother Nikolay s presence should come to disturb his happy mood of spring.",
      "But he felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once he opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that it was his brother.",
      "He pricked up his horse, and riding out from behind the acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station, and a gentleman in a fur coat.",
      "It was not his brother.",
      "Oh, if it were only some nice person one could talk to a little!",
      "Ah, cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands.",
      "Here s a delightful visitor!",
      "Ah, how glad I am to see you!",
      "he shouted, recognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I shall find out for certain whether she s married, or when she s going to be married, he thought.",
      "And on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all.",
      "Well, you didn t expect me, eh?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting out of the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose, on his cheek, and on his eyebrows, but radiant with health and good spirits.",
      "I ve come to see you in the first place, he said, embracing and kissing him, to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the forest at Ergushovo third.",
      "Delightful!",
      "What a spring we re having!",
      "How ever did you get along in a sledge?",
      "In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, answered the driver, who knew him.",
      "Well, I m very, very glad to see you, said Levin, with a genuine smile of childlike delight.",
      "Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan Arkadyevitch s things were carried also a bag, a gun in a case, a satchel for cigars.",
      "Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes, Levin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and clover.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, always very anxious for the credit of the house, met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner.",
      "Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible, he said, and went to the bailiff.",
      "When he came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of his room with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.",
      "Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you!",
      "Now I shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.",
      "No, really, I envy you.",
      "What a house, how nice it all is!",
      "So bright, so cheerful!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather like that day.",
      "And your nurse is simply charming!",
      "A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable, perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news; especially interesting to Levin was the news that his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, was intending to pay him a visit in the summer.",
      "Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the Shtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife.",
      "Levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor.",
      "As always happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not communicate to those about him.",
      "And now he poured out upon Stepan Arkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans for the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which really was, though he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books on agriculture.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding everything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on this visit, and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were, and a new tone of respect that flattered him.",
      "The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be particularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose and salted mushrooms, and in Levin s finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor.",
      "But though Stepan Arkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he thought everything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter, and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup, and the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine everything was superb and delicious.",
      "Splendid, splendid!",
      "he said, lighting a fat cigar after the roast.",
      "I feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer.",
      "And so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture.",
      "Of course, I m an ignorant outsider; but I should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too.",
      "Yes, but wait a bit.",
      "I m not talking of political economy, I m talking of the science of agriculture.",
      "It ought to be like the natural sciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic, ethnographical.... At that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.",
      "Oh, Agafea Mihalovna, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips of his plump fingers, what salt goose, what herb brandy!...",
      "What do you think, isn t it time to start, Kostya?",
      "he added.",
      "Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare tree-tops of the forest.",
      "Yes, it s time, he said.",
      "Kouzma, get ready the trap, and he ran downstairs.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands, and opening it, began to get ready his expensive new-fashioned gun.",
      "Kouzma, who already scented a big tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch s side, and put on him both his stockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him.",
      "Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ...",
      "I told him to come today, he s to be brought in and to wait for me.... Why, do you mean to say you re selling the forest to Ryabinin?",
      "Do you know him?",
      "To be sure I do.",
      "I have had to do business with him, positively and conclusively.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed.",
      "Positively and conclusively were the merchant s favorite words.",
      "Yes, it s wonderfully funny the way he talks.",
      "She knows where her master s going!",
      "he added, patting Laska, who hung about Levin, whining and licking his hands, his boots, and his gun.",
      "The trap was already at the steps when they went out.",
      "I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?",
      "No, we d better drive, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting into the trap.",
      "He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him, and lighted a cigar.",
      "How is it you don t smoke?",
      "A cigar is a sort of thing, not exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure.",
      "Come, this is life!",
      "How splendid it is!",
      "This is how I should like to live!",
      "Why, who prevents you?",
      "No, you re a lucky man!",
      "You ve got everything you like.",
      "You like horses and you have them; dogs you have them; shooting you have it; farming you have it.",
      "Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don t fret for what I haven t, said Levin, thinking of Kitty.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.",
      "Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing tact, that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so saying nothing about them.",
      "But now Levin was longing to find out what was tormenting him so, yet he had not the courage to begin.",
      "Come, tell me how things are going with you, said Levin, bethinking himself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled merrily.",
      "You don t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had one s rations of bread to your mind it s a crime; but I don t count life as life without love, he said, taking Levin s question his own way.",
      "What am I to do?",
      "I m made that way.",
      "And really, one does so little harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure.... What!",
      "is there something new, then?",
      "queried Levin.",
      "Yes, my boy, there is!",
      "There, do you see, you know the type of Ossian s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well, these women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are terrible.",
      "Woman, don t you know, is such a subject that however much you study it, it s always perfectly new.",
      "Well, then, it would be better not to study it.",
      "Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth, not in the finding it.",
      "Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women.",
      "Chapter 15 The place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse.",
      "On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap and led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite free from snow.",
      "He went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he took off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his arms to see if they were free.",
      "Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears.",
      "The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in the glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse, stood out clearly with their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen almost to bursting.",
      "From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained, came the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.",
      "Tiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.",
      "In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last year s leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of the grass.",
      "Imagine!",
      "One can hear and see the grass growing!",
      "Levin said to himself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass.",
      "He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes at the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.",
      "A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings; another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished.",
      "The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket.",
      "An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped cautiously a few steps forward, and putting her head on one side, began to listen intently.",
      "Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo.",
      "Twice she uttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and broke down.",
      "the cuckoo already!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out from behind a bush.",
      "Yes, I hear it, answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself.",
      "Now it s coming!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette.",
      "Tchk!",
      "came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking his gun.",
      "What s that cry?",
      "asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin s attention to a prolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice, in play.",
      "Oh, don t you know it?",
      "That s the hare.",
      "But enough talking!",
      "Listen, it s flying!",
      "almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun.",
      "They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so well known to the sportsman, two seconds later another, a third, and after the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.",
      "Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens, he saw the flying bird.",
      "It was flying straight towards him; the guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded close to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and at the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped like an arrow, and darted upwards again.",
      "Again came the red flash and the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground.",
      "Can I have missed it?",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not see for the smoke.",
      "Here it is!",
      "said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear raised, wagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead bird to her master.",
      "Well, I m glad you were successful, said Levin, who, at the same time, had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the snipe.",
      "It was a bad shot from the right barrel, responded Stepan Arkadyevitch, loading his gun.",
      "Sh... it s flying!",
      "The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again.",
      "Two snipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying, flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen.",
      "There was the report of four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight.",
      "The stand-shooting was capital.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds and Levin two, of which one was not found.",
      "It began to get dark.",
      "Venus, bright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of Arcturus.",
      "Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear and lost them again.",
      "The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to stay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch, should be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly plain.",
      "Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky, yet still he waited.",
      "Isn t it time to go home?",
      "It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.",
      "Let s stay a little while, answered Levin.",
      "As you like.",
      "They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.",
      "said Levin unexpectedly; how is it you don t tell me whether your sister-in-law s married yet, or when she s going to be?",
      "Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could affect him.",
      "But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch replied.",
      "She s never thought of being married, and isn t thinking of it; but she s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad.",
      "They re positively afraid she may not live.",
      "Very ill?",
      "What is wrong with her?",
      "How has she...?",
      "While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking upwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.",
      "They have chosen a time to talk, she was thinking.",
      "It s on the wing....",
      "Here it is, yes, it is.",
      "They ll miss it, thought Laska.",
      "But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as it were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant.",
      "The snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket, bending down the delicate shoots.",
      "Together!",
      "cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the thicket to look for the snipe.",
      "Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?",
      "he wondered.",
      "Yes, Kitty s ill.... Well, it can t be helped; I m very sorry, he thought.",
      "She s found it!",
      "Isn t she a clever thing?",
      "he said, taking the warm bird from Laska s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.",
      "I ve got it, Stiva!",
      "Chapter 16 On the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty s illness and the Shtcherbatskys plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit it, he was pleased at what he heard.",
      "He was pleased that there was still hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made him suffer so much.",
      "But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of the causes of Kitty s illness, and mentioned Vronsky s name, Levin cut him short.",
      "I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the truth, no interest in them either.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in Levin s face, which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.",
      "Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Yes, it s settled.",
      "The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.",
      "Eight straight away, and the rest in six years.",
      "I ve been bothering about it for ever so long.",
      "No one would give more.",
      "Then you ve as good as given away your forest for nothing, said Levin gloomily.",
      "How do you mean for nothing?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a good-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin s eyes now.",
      "Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the acre, answered Levin.",
      "Oh, these farmers!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully.",
      "Your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk!...",
      "But when it comes to business, we do it better than anyone.",
      "I assure you I have reckoned it all out, he said, and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that I m afraid of this fellow s crying off, in fact.",
      "You know it s not timber, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to convince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts.",
      "And it won t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he s giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.",
      "Levin smiled contemptuously.",
      "I know, he thought, that fashion not only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it.",
      "_Timber, run to so many yards the acre._ He says those words without understanding them himself.",
      "I wouldn t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office, said he, and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it.",
      "But you re so positive you know all the lore of the forest.",
      "It s difficult.",
      "Have you counted the trees?",
      "How count the trees?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying to draw his friend out of his ill-temper.",
      "Count the sands of the sea, number the stars.",
      "Some higher power might do it.",
      "Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can.",
      "Not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them for nothing, as you re doing now.",
      "I know your forest.",
      "I go there every year shooting, and your forest s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an acre paid down, while he s giving you sixty by installments.",
      "So that in fact you re making him a present of thirty thousand.",
      "Come, don t let your imagination run away with you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch piteously.",
      "Why was it none would give it, then?",
      "Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he s bought them off.",
      "I ve had to do with all of them; I know them.",
      "They re not merchants, you know: they re speculators.",
      "He wouldn t look at a bargain that gave him ten, fifteen per cent.",
      "profit, but holds back to buy a rouble s worth for twenty kopecks.",
      "Well, enough of it!",
      "You re out of temper.",
      "Not the least, said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.",
      "At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather, with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps.",
      "In the trap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as coachman.",
      "Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the friends in the hall.",
      "Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man, with mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent muddy-looking eyes.",
      "He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them.",
      "He rubbed his face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him his coat, which sat extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a smile, holding out his hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted to catch something.",
      "So here you are, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.",
      "That s capital.",
      "I did not venture to disregard your excellency s commands, though the road was extremely bad.",
      "I positively walked the whole way, but I am here at my time.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects ; he turned to Levin, trying to seize his hand too.",
      "But Levin, scowling, made as though he did not notice his hand, and took out the snipe.",
      "Your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase?",
      "What kind of bird may it be, pray?",
      "added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe: a great delicacy, I suppose.",
      "And he shook his head disapprovingly, as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.",
      "Would you like to go into my study?",
      "Levin said in French to Stepan Arkadyevitch, scowling morosely.",
      "Go into my study; you can talk there.",
      "Quite so, where you please, said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity, as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything.",
      "On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as though seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not cross himself.",
      "He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled contemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means willing to allow that this game were worth the candle.",
      "Well, have you brought the money?",
      "asked Oblonsky.",
      "Sit down.",
      "Oh, don t trouble about the money.",
      "I ve come to see you to talk it over.",
      "What is there to talk over?",
      "But do sit down.",
      "I don t mind if I do, said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself.",
      "You must knock it down a bit, prince.",
      "It would be too bad.",
      "The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing.",
      "As to paying the money down, there ll be no hitch there.",
      "Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was just going out of the door, but catching the merchant s words, he stopped.",
      "Why, you ve got the forest for nothing as it is, he said.",
      "He came to me too late, or I d have fixed the price for him.",
      "Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and up.",
      "Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch, he said with a smile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch; there s positively no dealing with him.",
      "I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I offered too.",
      "Why should I give you my goods for nothing?",
      "I didn t pick it up on the ground, nor steal it either.",
      "Mercy on us!",
      "nowadays there s no chance at all of stealing.",
      "With the open courts and everything done in style, nowadays there s no question of stealing.",
      "We are just talking things over like gentlemen.",
      "His excellency s asking too much for the forest.",
      "I can t make both ends meet over it.",
      "I must ask for a little concession.",
      "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
      "If it s settled, it s useless haggling; but if it s not, said Levin, I ll buy the forest.",
      "The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin s face.",
      "A hawklike, greedy, cruel expression was left upon it.",
      "With rapid, bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a watch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.",
      "Here you are, the forest is mine, he said, crossing himself quickly, and holding out his hand.",
      "Take the money; it s my forest.",
      "That s Ryabinin s way of doing business; he doesn t haggle over every half-penny, he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.",
      "I wouldn t be in a hurry if I were you, said Levin.",
      "Come, really, said Oblonsky in surprise.",
      "I ve given my word, you know.",
      "Levin went out of the room, slamming the door.",
      "Ryabinin looked towards the door and shook his head with a smile.",
      "It s all youthfulness positively nothing but boyishness.",
      "Why, I m buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.",
      "And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives.",
      "In God s name.",
      "If you would kindly sign the title-deed....",
      "Within an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and hooking up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself in his tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.",
      "Ugh, these gentlefolks!",
      "he said to the clerk.",
      "They they re a nice lot!",
      "That s so, responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron.",
      "But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?",
      "Well, well.... Chapter 17 Stepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes, which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance.",
      "The business of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their shooting had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the happiest frame of mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate the ill-humor that had come upon Levin.",
      "He wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun.",
      "Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control his mood.",
      "The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him.",
      "Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had slighted her.",
      "This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him.",
      "Vronsky had slighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin.",
      "Consequently Vronsky had the right to despise Levin, and therefore he was his enemy.",
      "But all this Levin did not think out.",
      "He vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him, but he fell foul of everything that presented itself.",
      "The stupid sale of the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in his house, exasperated him.",
      "Well, finished?",
      "he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs.",
      "Would you like supper?",
      "Well, I wouldn t say no to it.",
      "What an appetite I get in the country!",
      "Wonderful!",
      "Why didn t you offer Ryabinin something?",
      "Oh, damn him!",
      "Still, how you do treat him!",
      "said Oblonsky.",
      "You didn t even shake hands with him.",
      "Why not shake hands with him?",
      "Because I don t shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter s a hundred times better than he is.",
      "What a reactionist you are, really!",
      "What about the amalgamation of classes?",
      "Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens me.",
      "You re a regular reactionist, I see.",
      "Really, I have never considered what I am.",
      "I am Konstantin Levin, and nothing else.",
      "And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
      "Because excuse me of your stupid sale.... Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own.",
      "Come, enough about it!",
      "When did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale, It was worth much more ?",
      "But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... No, I see you ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin.",
      "Maybe I have.",
      "And do you know why?",
      "You ll say again that I m a reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of classes, I m glad to belong.",
      "And their impoverishment is not due to extravagance that would be nothing; living in good style that s the proper thing for noblemen; it s only the nobles who know how to do it.",
      "Now the peasants about us buy land, and I don t mind that.",
      "The gentleman does nothing, while the peasant works and supplants the idle man.",
      "That s as it ought to be.",
      "And I m very glad for the peasant.",
      "But I do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of I don t know what to call it innocence.",
      "Here a Polish speculator bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in Nice.",
      "And there a merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten roubles, as security for the loan of one rouble.",
      "Here, for no kind of reason, you ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles.",
      "Well, what should I have done?",
      "Counted every tree?",
      "Of course, they must be counted.",
      "You didn t count them, but Ryabinin did.",
      "Ryabinin s children will have means of livelihood and education, while yours maybe will not!",
      "Well, you must excuse me, but there s something mean in this counting.",
      "We have our business and they have theirs, and they must make their profit.",
      "Anyway, the thing s done, and there s an end of it.",
      "And here come some poached eggs, my favorite dish.",
      "And Agafea Mihalovna will give us that marvelous herb-brandy.... Stepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea Mihalovna, assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper.",
      "Well, you do praise it, anyway, said Agafea Mihalovna, but Konstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will a crust of bread he ll eat it and walk away.",
      "Though Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent.",
      "He wanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch, but he could not bring himself to the point, and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room, undressed, again washed, and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills, he had got into bed, but Levin still lingered in his room, talking of various trifling matters, and not daring to ask what he wanted to know.",
      "How wonderfully they make this soap, he said gazing at a piece of soap he was handling, which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for the visitor but Oblonsky had not used.",
      "Only look; why, it s a work of art.",
      "Yes, everything s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a moist and blissful yawn.",
      "The theater, for instance, and the entertainments ... a a a!",
      "he yawned.",
      "The electric light everywhere ... a a a!",
      "Yes, the electric light, said Levin.",
      "Oh, and where s Vronsky now?",
      "he asked suddenly, laying down the soap.",
      "Vronsky?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his yawn; he s in Petersburg.",
      "He left soon after you did, and he s not once been in Moscow since.",
      "And do you know, Kostya, I ll tell you the truth, he went on, leaning his elbow on the table, and propping on his hand his handsome ruddy face, in which his moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes shone like stars.",
      "It s your own fault.",
      "You took fright at the sight of your rival.",
      "But, as I told you at the time, I couldn t say which had the better chance.",
      "Why didn t you fight it out?",
      "I told you at the time that....",
      "He yawned inwardly, without opening his mouth.",
      "Does he know, or doesn t he, that I did make an offer?",
      "Levin wondered, gazing at him.",
      "Yes, there s something humbugging, diplomatic in his face, and feeling he was blushing, he looked Stepan Arkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking.",
      "If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but a superficial attraction, pursued Oblonsky.",
      "His being such a perfect aristocrat, don t you know, and his future position in society, had an influence not with her, but with her mother.",
      "Levin scowled.",
      "The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart, as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received.",
      "But he was at home, and the walls of home are a support.",
      "Stay, stay, he began, interrupting Oblonsky.",
      "You talk of his being an aristocrat.",
      "But allow me to ask what it consists in, that aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked down upon?",
      "You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don t. A man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother God knows whom she wasn t mixed up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider myself aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family, of the highest degree of breeding (talent and intellect, of course that s another matter), and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on anyone for anything, like my father and my grandfather.",
      "And I know many such.",
      "You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while you make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from your lands and I don t know what, while I don t and so I prize what s come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work.... We are aristocrats, and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful of this world, and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny.",
      "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
      "I agree with you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was reckoning him too.",
      "Levin s warmth gave him genuine pleasure.",
      "Whom are you attacking?",
      "Though a good deal is not true that you say about Vronsky, but I won t talk about that.",
      "I tell you straight out, if I were you, I should go back with me to Moscow, and.... No; I don t know whether you know it or not, but I don t care.",
      "And I tell you I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence.",
      "What ever for?",
      "But we won t talk about it.",
      "Please forgive me, if I ve been nasty, said Levin.",
      "Now that he had opened his heart, he became as he had been in the morning.",
      "You re not angry with me, Stiva?",
      "Please don t be angry, he said, and smiling, he took his hand.",
      "Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be.",
      "I m glad we ve spoken openly.",
      "And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually good why not go?",
      "I couldn t sleep the night anyway, but I might go straight from shooting to the station.",
      "Chapter 18 Although all Vronsky s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests.",
      "The interests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky s life, both because he was fond of the regiment, and because the regiment was fond of him.",
      "They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment, they respected him too, and were proud of him; proud that this man, with his immense wealth, his brilliant education and abilities, and the path open before him to every kind of success, distinction, and ambition, had disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart.",
      "Vronsky was aware of his comrades view of him, and in addition to his liking for the life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation.",
      "It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades, nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself).",
      "And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his connection.",
      "But in spite of that, his love was known to all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his relations with Madame Karenina.",
      "The majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted position of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of their connection in society.",
      "The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long been weary of hearing her called _virtuous_, rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn.",
      "They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at her when the right moment arrived.",
      "The greater number of the middle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society.",
      "Vronsky s mother, on hearing of his connection, was at first pleased at it, because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a _liaison_ in the highest society; she was pleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her fancy, and had talked so much of her son, was, after all, just like all other pretty and well-bred women, at least according to the Countess Vronskaya s ideas.",
      "But she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career, simply in order to remain in the regiment, where he could be constantly seeing Madame Karenina.",
      "She learned that great personages were displeased with him on this account, and she changed her opinion.",
      "She was vexed, too, that from all she could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant, graceful, worldly _liaison_ which she would have welcomed, but a sort of Wertherish, desperate passion, so she was told, which might well lead him into imprudence.",
      "She had not seen him since his abrupt departure from Moscow, and she sent her elder son to bid him come to see her.",
      "This elder son, too, was displeased with his younger brother.",
      "He did not distinguish what sort of love his might be, big or little, passionate or passionless, lasting or passing (he kept a ballet girl himself, though he was the father of a family, so he was lenient in these matters), but he knew that this love affair was viewed with displeasure by those whom it was necessary to please, and therefore he did not approve of his brother s conduct.",
      "Besides the service and society, Vronsky had another great interest horses; he was passionately fond of horses.",
      "That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.",
      "Vronsky had put his name down, bought a thoroughbred English mare, and in spite of his love affair, he was looking forward to the races with intense, though reserved, excitement....",
      "These two passions did not interfere with one another.",
      "On the contrary, he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love, so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him.",
      "Chapter 19 On the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier than usual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment.",
      "He had no need to be strict with himself, as he had very quickly been brought down to the required light weight; but still he had to avoid gaining flesh, and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes.",
      "He sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the table, and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a French novel that lay open on his plate.",
      "He was only looking at the book to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out; he was thinking.",
      "He was thinking of Anna s promise to see him that day after the races.",
      "But he had not seen her for three days, and as her husband had just returned from abroad, he did not know whether she would be able to meet him today or not, and he did not know how to find out.",
      "He had had his last interview with her at his cousin Betsy s summer villa.",
      "He visited the Karenins summer villa as rarely as possible.",
      "Now he wanted to go there, and he pondered the question how to do it.",
      "Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she s coming to the races.",
      "Of course, I ll go, he decided, lifting his head from the book.",
      "And as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her, his face lighted up.",
      "Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and three horses as quick as they can, he said to the servant, who handed him the steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up he began eating.",
      "From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking, of talk and laughter.",
      "Two officers appeared at the entrance-door: one, a young fellow, with a feeble, delicate face, who had lately joined the regiment from the Corps of Pages; the other, a plump, elderly officer, with a bracelet on his wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.",
      "Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his book as though he had not noticed them, he proceeded to eat and read at the same time.",
      "Fortifying yourself for your work?",
      "said the plump officer, sitting down beside him.",
      "As you see, responded Vronsky, knitting his brows, wiping his mouth, and not looking at the officer.",
      "So you re not afraid of getting fat?",
      "said the latter, turning a chair round for the young officer.",
      "said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust, and showing his even teeth.",
      "You re not afraid of getting fat?",
      "Waiter, sherry!",
      "said Vronsky, without replying, and moving the book to the other side of him, he went on reading.",
      "The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young officer.",
      "You choose what we re to drink, he said, handing him the card, and looking at him.",
      "Rhine wine, please, said the young officer, stealing a timid glance at Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache.",
      "Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round, the young officer got up.",
      "Let s go into the billiard room, he said.",
      "The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.",
      "At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built Captain Yashvin.",
      "Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two officers, he went up to Vronsky.",
      "he cried, bringing his big hand down heavily on his epaulet.",
      "Vronsky looked round angrily, but his face lighted up immediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly serenity.",
      "That s it, Alexey, said the captain, in his loud baritone.",
      "You must just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass.",
      "Oh, I m not hungry.",
      "There go the inseparables, Yashvin dropped, glancing sarcastically at the two officers who were at that instant leaving the room.",
      "And he bent his long legs, swathed in tight riding breeches, and sat down in the chair, too low for him, so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp angle.",
      "Why didn t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday?",
      "Numerova wasn t at all bad.",
      "Where were you?",
      "I was late at the Tverskoys , said Vronsky.",
      "responded Yashvin.",
      "Yashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral principles, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky s greatest friend in the regiment.",
      "Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength, which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it; and for his great strength of character, which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at cards, when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk, always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the English Club.",
      "Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because he felt Yashvin liked him, not for his name and his money, but for himself.",
      "And of all men he was the only one with whom Vronsky would have liked to speak of his love.",
      "He felt that Yashvin, in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only man who could, so he fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life.",
      "Moreover, he felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took no delight in gossip and scandal, and interpreted his feeling rightly, that is to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a jest, not a pastime, but something more serious and important.",
      "Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion, but he was aware that he knew all about it, and that he put the right interpretation on it, and he was glad to see that in his eyes.",
      "yes, he said, to the announcement that Vronsky had been at the Tverskoys ; and his black eyes shining, he plucked at his left mustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he had.",
      "Well, and what did you do yesterday?",
      "Win anything?",
      "Eight thousand.",
      "But three don t count; he won t pay up.",
      "Oh, then you can afford to lose over me, said Vronsky, laughing.",
      "(Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)",
      "No chance of my losing.",
      "Mahotin s the only one that s risky.",
      "And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the only thing Vronsky could think of just now.",
      "Come along, I ve finished, said Vronsky, and getting up he went to the door.",
      "Yashvin got up too, stretching his long legs and his long back.",
      "It s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink.",
      "I ll come along directly.",
      "Hi, wine!",
      "he shouted, in his rich voice, that always rang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows shaking now.",
      "No, all right, he shouted again immediately after.",
      "You re going home, so I ll go with you.",
      "And he walked out with Vronsky.",
      "Chapter 20 Vronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into two by a partition.",
      "Petritsky lived with him in camp too.",
      "Petritsky was asleep when Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.",
      "Get up, don t go on sleeping, said Yashvin, going behind the partition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair and with his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder.",
      "Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round.",
      "Your brother s been here, he said to Vronsky.",
      "He waked me up, damn him, and said he d look in again.",
      "And pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow.",
      "Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!",
      "he said, getting furious with Yashvin, who was pulling the rug off him.",
      "Shut up!",
      "He turned over and opened his eyes.",
      "You d better tell me what to drink; such a nasty taste in my mouth, that....",
      "Brandy s better than anything, boomed Yashvin.",
      "Tereshtchenko!",
      "brandy for your master and cucumbers, he shouted, obviously taking pleasure in the sound of his own voice.",
      "Brandy, do you think?",
      "queried Petritsky, blinking and rubbing his eyes.",
      "And you ll drink something?",
      "All right then, we ll have a drink together!",
      "Vronsky, have a drink?",
      "said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping the tiger-skin rug round him.",
      "He went to the door of the partition wall, raised his hands, and hummed in French, There was a king in Thule.",
      "Vronsky, will you have a drink?",
      "Go along, said Vronsky, putting on the coat his valet handed to him.",
      "Where are you off to?",
      "asked Yashvin.",
      "Oh, here are your three horses, he added, seeing the carriage drive up.",
      "To the stables, and I ve got to see Bryansky, too, about the horses, said Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky s, some eight miles from Peterhof, and to bring him some money owing for some horses; and he hoped to have time to get that in too.",
      "But his comrades were at once aware that he was not only going there.",
      "Petritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his lips, as though he would say: Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.",
      "Mind you re not late!",
      "was Yashvin s only comment; and to change the conversation: How s my roan?",
      "is he doing all right?",
      "he inquired, looking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses, which he had sold Vronsky.",
      "Stop!",
      "cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out.",
      "Your brother left a letter and a note for you.",
      "Wait a bit; where are they?",
      "Vronsky stopped.",
      "Well, where are they?",
      "Where are they?",
      "That s just the question!",
      "said Petritsky solemnly, moving his forefinger upwards from his nose.",
      "Come, tell me; this is silly!",
      "said Vronsky smiling.",
      "I have not lighted the fire.",
      "Here somewhere about.",
      "Come, enough fooling!",
      "Where is the letter?",
      "No, I ve forgotten really.",
      "Or was it a dream?",
      "Wait a bit, wait a bit!",
      "But what s the use of getting in a rage.",
      "If you d drunk four bottles yesterday as I did you d forget where you were lying.",
      "Wait a bit, I ll remember!",
      "Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed.",
      "Wait a bit!",
      "This was how I was lying, and this was how he was standing.",
      "Yes yes yes....",
      "and Petritsky pulled a letter out from under the mattress, where he had hidden it.",
      "Vronsky took the letter and his brother s note.",
      "It was the letter he was expecting from his mother, reproaching him for not having been to see her and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a little talk with him.",
      "Vronsky knew that it was all about the same thing.",
      "What business is it of theirs!",
      "thought Vronsky, and crumpling up the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to read them carefully on the road.",
      "In the porch of the hut he was met by two officers; one of his regiment and one of another.",
      "Vronsky s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers.",
      "I must go to Peterhof.",
      "Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?",
      "Yes, but I ve not seen her yet.",
      "They say Mahotin s Gladiator s lame.",
      "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
      "said the other.",
      "Here are my saviors!",
      "cried Petritsky, seeing them come in.",
      "Before him stood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers.",
      "Here s Yashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.",
      "Well, you did give it to us yesterday, said one of those who had come in; you didn t let us get a wink of sleep all night.",
      "Oh, didn t we make a pretty finish!",
      "said Petritsky.",
      "Volkov climbed onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was.",
      "I said: Let s have music, the funeral march!",
      "He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over the funeral march.",
      "Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer water and a lot of lemon, said Yashvin, standing over Petritsky like a mother making a child take medicine, and then a little champagne just a small bottle.",
      "Come, there s some sense in that.",
      "Stop a bit, Vronsky.",
      "We ll all have a drink.",
      "No; good-bye all of you.",
      "I m not going to drink today.",
      "Why, are you gaining weight?",
      "All right, then we must have it alone.",
      "Give us the seltzer water and lemon.",
      "shouted someone when he was already outside.",
      "You d better get your hair cut, it ll weigh you down, especially at the top.",
      "Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald.",
      "He laughed gaily, showing his even teeth, and pulling his cap over the thin place, went out and got into his carriage.",
      "To the stables!",
      "he said, and was just pulling out the letters to read them through, but he thought better of it, and put off reading them so as not to distract his attention before looking at the mare.",
      "Later!",
      "Chapter 21 The temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race course, and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day.",
      "He had not yet seen her there.",
      "During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself, but had put her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he positively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday and was today.",
      "He had scarcely got out of his carriage when his groom, the so-called stable boy, recognizing the carriage some way off, called the trainer.",
      "A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots and a short jacket, clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his chin, came to meet him, walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side.",
      "Well, how s Frou-Frou?",
      "Vronsky asked in English.",
      "All right, sir, the Englishman s voice responded somewhere in the inside of his throat.",
      "Better not go in, he added, touching his hat.",
      "I ve put a muzzle on her, and the mare s fidgety.",
      "Better not go in, it ll excite the mare.",
      "No, I m going in.",
      "I want to look at her.",
      "Come along, then, said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with his mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in front with his disjointed gait.",
      "They went into the little yard in front of the shed.",
      "A stable boy, spruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his hand, and followed them.",
      "In the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his chief rival, Gladiator, a very tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing among them.",
      "Even more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator, whom he had never seen.",
      "But he knew that by the etiquette of the race course it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but improper even to ask questions about him.",
      "Just as he was passing along the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs.",
      "He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another man s open letter, he turned round and went into Frou-Frou s stall.",
      "The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak...",
      "I never can say the name, said the Englishman, over his shoulder, pointing his big finger and dirty nail towards Gladiator s stall.",
      "Mahotin?",
      "Yes, he s my most serious rival, said Vronsky.",
      "If you were riding him, said the Englishman, I d bet on you.",
      "Frou-Frou s more nervous; he s stronger, said Vronsky, smiling at the compliment to his riding.",
      "In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck, said the Englishman.",
      "Of pluck that is, energy and courage Vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough; what was of far more importance, he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this pluck than he had.",
      "Don t you think I want more thinning down?",
      "Oh, no, answered the Englishman.",
      "Please, don t speak loud.",
      "The mare s fidgety, he added, nodding towards the horse-box, before which they were standing, and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw.",
      "He opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted by one little window.",
      "In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a muzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs.",
      "Looking round him in the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare.",
      "Frou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from reproach, from a breeder s point of view.",
      "She was small-boned all over; though her chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow.",
      "Her hind-quarters were a little drooping, and in her fore-legs, and still more in her hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature.",
      "The muscles of both hind- and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training.",
      "The bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side.",
      "She looked altogether, except across the shoulders, as it were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth.",
      "But she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten: that quality was _blood_, the blood _that tells_, as the English expression has it.",
      "The muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews, covered with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as satin, and they were hard as bone.",
      "Her clean-cut head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes, broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the cartilage within.",
      "About all her figure, and especially her head, there was a certain expression of energy, and, at the same time, of softness.",
      "She was one of those creatures which seem only not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow them to.",
      "To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment, looking at her.",
      "Directly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and, turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.",
      "There, you see how fidgety she is, said the Englishman.",
      "There, darling!",
      "There!",
      "said Vronsky, going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her.",
      "But the nearer he came, the more excited she grew.",
      "Only when he stood by her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under her soft, delicate coat.",
      "Vronsky patted her strong neck, straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side, and moved his face near her dilated nostrils, transparent as a bat s wing.",
      "She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her strong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his sleeve.",
      "But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began restlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs.",
      "Quiet, darling, quiet!",
      "he said, patting her again over her hind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition, he went out of the horse-box.",
      "The mare s excitement had infected Vronsky.",
      "He felt that his heart was throbbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it was both dreadful and delicious.",
      "Well, I rely on you, then, he said to the Englishman; half-past six on the ground.",
      "All right, said the Englishman.",
      "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
      "he asked suddenly, using the title my lord, which he had scarcely ever used before.",
      "Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to stare, not into the Englishman s eyes, but at his forehead, astounded at the impertinence of his question.",
      "But realizing that in asking this the Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer, but as a jockey, he answered: I ve got to go to Bryansky s; I shall be home within an hour.",
      "How often I m asked that question today!",
      "he said to himself, and he blushed, a thing which rarely happened to him.",
      "The Englishman looked gravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where Vronsky was going, he added: The great thing s to keep quiet before a race, said he; don t get out of temper or upset about anything.",
      "All right, answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his carriage, he told the man to drive to Peterhof.",
      "Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.",
      "thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage.",
      "It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.",
      "As he sat in solitude in the closed carriage, he took out his mother s letter and his brother s note, and read them through.",
      "Yes, it was the same thing over and over again.",
      "Everyone, his mother, his brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart.",
      "This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before.",
      "What business is it of theirs?",
      "Why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me?",
      "And why do they worry me so?",
      "Just because they see that this is something they can t understand.",
      "If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they would have left me alone.",
      "They feel that this is something different, that this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than life.",
      "And this is incomprehensible, and that s why it annoys them.",
      "Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do not complain of it, he said, in the word _we_ linking himself with Anna.",
      "No, they must needs teach us how to live.",
      "They haven t an idea of what happiness is; they don t know that without our love, for us there is neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all, he thought.",
      "He was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they, all these people, were right.",
      "He felt that the love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which would pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in the life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories.",
      "He felt all the torture of his own and her position, all the difficulty there was for them, conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in concealing their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving, feigning, and continually thinking of others, when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else but their love.",
      "He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his natural bent.",
      "He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit.",
      "And he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his secret love for Anna.",
      "This was a feeling of loathing for something whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or for the whole world, he could not have said.",
      "But he always drove away this strange feeling.",
      "Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts.",
      "Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not show it.",
      "Yes, we must put an end to it, he decided.",
      "And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the better.",
      "Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love, he said to himself.",
      "Chapter 22 The rain did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, his shaft-horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace-horses galloping through the mud, with their reins hanging loose, the sun had peeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees in the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet brilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water.",
      "He thought no more of the shower spoiling the race course, but was rejoicing now that thanks to the rain he would be sure to find her at home and alone, as he knew that Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had lately returned from a foreign watering place, had not moved from Petersburg.",
      "Hoping to find her alone, Vronsky alighted, as he always did, to avoid attracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and walked to the house.",
      "He did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the court.",
      "Has your master come?",
      "he asked a gardener.",
      "No, sir.",
      "The mistress is at home.",
      "But will you please go to the front door; there are servants there, the gardener answered.",
      "They ll open the door.",
      "No, I ll go in from the garden.",
      "And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by surprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with flowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden.",
      "Vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of their position.",
      "He thought of nothing but that he would see her directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her, as she was in reality.",
      "He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as not to creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her, her son with his questioning hostile, as he fancied eyes.",
      "This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.",
      "When he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone; they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand.",
      "They had made no agreement about this, it had settled itself.",
      "They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive the child.",
      "In his presence they talked like acquaintances.",
      "But in spite of this caution, Vronsky often saw the child s intent, bewildered glance fixed upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time friendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy s manner to him; as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond, the significance of which he could not understand.",
      "As a fact, the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation, and he tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man.",
      "With a child s keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling, he saw distinctly that his father, his governess, his nurse, all did not merely dislike Vronsky, but looked on him with horror and aversion, though they never said anything about him, while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend.",
      "Who is he?",
      "How ought I to love him?",
      "If I don t know, it s my fault; either I m stupid or a naughty boy, thought the child.",
      "And this was what caused his dubious, inquiring, sometimes hostile, expression, and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky found so irksome.",
      "This child s presence always and infallibly called up in Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late.",
      "This child s presence called up both in Vronsky and in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one, but that to arrest his motion is not in his power, that every instant is carrying him further and further away, and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as admitting his certain ruin.",
      "This child, with his innocent outlook upon life, was the compass that showed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew, but did not want to know.",
      "This time Seryozha was not at home, and she was completely alone.",
      "She was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son, who had gone out for his walk and been caught in the rain.",
      "She had sent a manservant and a maid out to look for him.",
      "Dressed in a white gown, deeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers, and did not hear him.",
      "Bending her curly black head, she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well, clasped the pot.",
      "The beauty of her whole figure, her head, her neck, her hands, struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected.",
      "He stood still, gazing at her in ecstasy.",
      "But, directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her, she was aware of his presence, pushed away the watering pot, and turned her flushed face towards him.",
      "What s the matter?",
      "You are ill?",
      "he said to her in French, going up to her.",
      "He would have run to her, but remembering that there might be spectators, he looked round towards the balcony door, and reddened a little, as he always reddened, feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard.",
      "No, I m quite well, she said, getting up and pressing his outstretched hand tightly.",
      "I did not expect ... thee.",
      "Mercy!",
      "what cold hands!",
      "You startled me, she said.",
      "I m alone, and expecting Seryozha; he s out for a walk; they ll come in from this side.",
      "But, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering.",
      "Forgive me for coming, but I couldn t pass the day without seeing you, he went on, speaking French, as he always did to avoid using the stiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid between them, and the dangerously intimate singular.",
      "Forgive you?",
      "I m so glad!",
      "But you re ill or worried, he went on, not letting go her hands and bending over her.",
      "What were you thinking of?",
      "Always the same thing, she said, with a smile.",
      "She spoke the truth.",
      "If ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of her happiness and her unhappiness.",
      "She was thinking, just when he came upon her, of this: why was it, she wondered, that to others, to Betsy (she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch) it was all easy, while to her it was such torture?",
      "Today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations.",
      "She asked him about the races.",
      "He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated, trying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races.",
      "Tell him or not tell him?",
      "she thought, looking into his quiet, affectionate eyes.",
      "He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he won t understand as he ought, he won t understand all the gravity of this fact to us.",
      "But you haven t told me what you were thinking of when I came in, he said, interrupting his narrative; please tell me!",
      "She did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under their long lashes.",
      "Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked.",
      "He saw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish devotion, which had done so much to win her.",
      "I see something has happened.",
      "Do you suppose I can be at peace, knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing?",
      "Tell me, for God s sake, he repeated imploringly.",
      "Yes, I shan t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the gravity of it.",
      "Better not tell; why put him to the proof?",
      "she thought, still staring at him in the same way, and feeling the hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more.",
      "For God s sake!",
      "he repeated, taking her hand.",
      "Shall I tell you?",
      "Yes, yes, yes....",
      "I m with child, she said, softly and deliberately.",
      "The leaf in her hand shook more violently, but she did not take her eyes off him, watching how he would take it.",
      "He turned white, would have said something, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and his head sank on his breast.",
      "Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it, she thought, and gratefully she pressed his hand.",
      "But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as she, a woman, realized it.",
      "On hearing it, he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone.",
      "But at the same time, he felt that the turning-point he had been longing for had come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position.",
      "But, besides that, her emotion physically affected him in the same way.",
      "He looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in silence, paced up and down the terrace.",
      "Yes, he said, going up to her resolutely.",
      "Neither you nor I have looked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now our fate is sealed.",
      "It is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he spoke to the deception in which we are living.",
      "Put an end?",
      "How put an end, Alexey?",
      "she said softly.",
      "She was calmer now, and her face lighted up with a tender smile.",
      "Leave your husband and make our life one.",
      "It is one as it is, she answered, scarcely audibly.",
      "Yes, but altogether; altogether.",
      "But how, Alexey, tell me how?",
      "she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own position.",
      "Is there any way out of such a position?",
      "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
      "There is a way out of every position.",
      "We must take our line, he said.",
      "Anything s better than the position in which you re living.",
      "Of course, I see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband.",
      "Oh, not over my husband, she said, with a quiet smile.",
      "I don t know him, I don t think of him.",
      "He doesn t exist.",
      "You re not speaking sincerely.",
      "I know you.",
      "You worry about him too.",
      "Oh, he doesn t even know, she said, and suddenly a hot flush came over her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned, and tears of shame came into her eyes.",
      "But we won t talk of him.",
      "Chapter 23 Vronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now, tried to bring her to consider their position, and every time he had been confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which she met his appeal now.",
      "It was as though there were something in this which she could not or would not face, as though directly she began to speak of this, she, the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and another strange and unaccountable woman came out, whom he did not love, and whom he feared, and who was in opposition to him.",
      "But today he was resolved to have it out.",
      "Whether he knows or not, said Vronsky, in his usual quiet and resolute tone, that s nothing to do with us.",
      "We cannot ... you cannot stay like this, especially now.",
      "What s to be done, according to you?",
      "she asked with the same frivolous irony.",
      "She who had so feared he would take her condition too lightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of taking some step.",
      "Tell him everything, and leave him.",
      "Very well, let us suppose I do that, she said.",
      "Do you know what the result of that would be?",
      "I can tell you it all beforehand, and a wicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been so soft a minute before.",
      "Eh, you love another man, and have entered into criminal intrigues with him?",
      "(Mimicking her husband, she threw an emphasis on the word criminal, as Alexey Alexandrovitch did.)",
      "I warned you of the results in the religious, the civil, and the domestic relation.",
      "You have not listened to me.",
      "Now I cannot let you disgrace my name, and my son, she had meant to say, but about her son she could not jest, disgrace my name, and and more in the same style, she added.",
      "In general terms, he ll say in his official manner, and with all distinctness and precision, that he cannot let me go, but will take all measures in his power to prevent scandal.",
      "And he will calmly and punctually act in accordance with his words.",
      "That s what will happen.",
      "He s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when he s angry, she added, recalling Alexey Alexandrovitch as she spoke, with all the peculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking, and reckoning against him every defect she could find in him, softening nothing for the great wrong she herself was doing him.",
      "But, Anna, said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying to soothe her, we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and then be guided by the line he takes.",
      "What, run away?",
      "And why not run away?",
      "I don t see how we can keep on like this.",
      "And not for my sake I see that you suffer.",
      "Yes, run away, and become your mistress, she said angrily.",
      "Anna, he said, with reproachful tenderness.",
      "Yes, she went on, become your mistress, and complete the ruin of.... Again she would have said my son, but she could not utter that word.",
      "Vronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful nature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of it.",
      "But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the word _son_, which she could not bring herself to pronounce.",
      "When she thought of her son, and his future attitude to his mother, who had abandoned his father, she felt such terror at what she had done, that she could not face it; but, like a woman, could only try to comfort herself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always had been, and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of how it would be with her son.",
      "I beg you, I entreat you, she said suddenly, taking his hand, and speaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender, never speak to me of that!",
      "But, Anna.... Never.",
      "Leave it to me.",
      "I know all the baseness, all the horror of my position; but it s not so easy to arrange as you think.",
      "And leave it to me, and do what I say.",
      "Never speak to me of it.",
      "Do you promise me?...",
      "No, no, promise!...",
      "I promise everything, but I can t be at peace, especially after what you have told me.",
      "I can t be at peace, when you can t be at peace....",
      "she repeated.",
      "Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will pass, if you will never talk about this.",
      "When you talk about it it s only then it worries me.",
      "I don t understand, he said.",
      "I know, she interrupted him, how hard it is for your truthful nature to lie, and I grieve for you.",
      "I often think that you have ruined your whole life for me.",
      "I was just thinking the very same thing, he said; how could you sacrifice everything for my sake?",
      "I can t forgive myself that you re unhappy!",
      "I unhappy?",
      "she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him with an ecstatic smile of love.",
      "I am like a hungry man who has been given food.",
      "He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not unhappy.",
      "No, this is my unhappiness.... She could hear the sound of her son s voice coming towards them, and glancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively.",
      "Her eyes glowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement she raised her lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, looked a long look into his face, and, putting up her face with smiling, parted lips, swiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and pushed him away.",
      "She would have gone, but he held her back.",
      "When?",
      "he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her.",
      "Tonight, at one o clock, she whispered, and, with a heavy sigh, she walked with her light, swift step to meet her son.",
      "Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he and his nurse had taken shelter in an arbor.",
      "Well, _au revoir_, she said to Vronsky.",
      "I must soon be getting ready for the races.",
      "Betsy promised to fetch me.",
      "Vronsky, looking at his watch, went away hurriedly.",
      "Chapter 24 When Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins balcony, he was so greatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on the watch s face, but could not take in what time it was.",
      "He came out on to the highroad and walked, picking his way carefully through the mud, to his carriage.",
      "He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for Anna, that he did not even think what o clock it was, and whether he had time to go to Bryansky s. He had left him, as often happens, only the external faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to take, one after the other.",
      "He went up to his coachman, who was dozing on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick limetree; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses, and, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told him to drive to Bryansky s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch, and realize that it was half-past five, and he was late.",
      "There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards race, then the officers mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile race, and then the race for which he was entered.",
      "He could still be in time for his race, but if he went to Bryansky s he could only just be in time, and he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their places.",
      "That would be a pity.",
      "But he had promised Bryansky to come, and so he decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare the horses.",
      "He reached Bryansky s, spent five minutes there, and galloped back.",
      "This rapid drive calmed him.",
      "All that was painful in his relations with Anna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation, had slipped out of his mind.",
      "He was thinking now with pleasure and excitement of the race, of his being anyhow, in time, and now and then the thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed across his imagination like a flaming light.",
      "The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove further and further into the atmosphere of the races, overtaking carriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg.",
      "At his quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races, and his valet was looking out for him at the gate.",
      "While he was changing his clothes, his valet told him that the second race had begun already, that a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him, and a boy had twice run up from the stables.",
      "Dressing without hurry (he never hurried himself, and never lost his self-possession), Vronsky drove to the sheds.",
      "From the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and people on foot, soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions swarming with people.",
      "The second race was apparently going on, for just as he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing.",
      "Going towards the stable, he met the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin s Gladiator, being led to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked like huge ears edged with blue.",
      "Where s Cord?",
      "he asked the stable-boy.",
      "In the stable, putting on the saddle.",
      "In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready.",
      "They were just going to lead her out.",
      "I m not too late?",
      "All right!",
      "said the Englishman; don t upset yourself!",
      "Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his favorite mare; who was quivering all over, and with an effort he tore himself from the sight of her, and went out of the stable.",
      "He went towards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping attention.",
      "The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing, and all eyes were fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind, urging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.",
      "From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the winning post, and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse-guards were shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their officer and comrade.",
      "Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed, almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race, and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first, bending over the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray horse that looked dark with sweat.",
      "The horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid course, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him like a man waking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile.",
      "A crowd of friends and outsiders pressed round him.",
      "Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world, which was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the pavilions.",
      "He knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, and his brother s wife, and he purposely did not go near them for fear of something distracting his attention.",
      "But he was continually met and stopped by acquaintances, who told him about the previous races, and kept asking him why he was so late.",
      "At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the prizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky s elder brother, Alexander, a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets, came up to him.",
      "He was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexey, and handsomer and rosier than he; he had a red nose, and an open, drunken-looking face.",
      "Did you get my note?",
      "There s never any finding you.",
      "Alexander Vronsky, in spite of the dissolute life, and in especial the drunken habits, for which he was notorious, was quite one of the court circle.",
      "Now, as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly disagreeable to him, knowing that the eyes of many people might be fixed upon him, he kept a smiling countenance, as though he were jesting with his brother about something of little moment.",
      "I got it, and I really can t make out what _you_ are worrying yourself about, said Alexey.",
      "I m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that you weren t here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday.",
      "There are matters which only concern those directly interested in them, and the matter you are so worried about is....",
      "Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service....",
      "I beg you not to meddle, and that s all I have to say.",
      "Alexey Vronsky s frowning face turned white, and his prominent lower jaw quivered, which happened rarely with him.",
      "Being a man of very warm heart, he was seldom angry; but when he was angry, and when his chin quivered, then, as Alexander Vronsky knew, he was dangerous.",
      "Alexander Vronsky smiled gaily.",
      "I only wanted to give you Mother s letter.",
      "Answer it, and don t worry about anything just before the race.",
      "_Bonne chance,_ he added, smiling and he moved away from him.",
      "But after him another friendly greeting brought Vronsky to a standstill.",
      "So you won t recognize your friends!",
      "How are you, _mon cher?_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the Petersburg brilliance as he was in Moscow, his face rosy, and his whiskers sleek and glossy.",
      "I came up yesterday, and I m delighted that I shall see your triumph.",
      "When shall we meet?",
      "Come tomorrow to the messroom, said Vronsky, and squeezing him by the sleeve of his coat, with apologies, he moved away to the center of the race course, where the horses were being led for the great steeplechase.",
      "The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming and exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh horses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part English racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up bellies like strange, huge birds.",
      "On the right was led in Frou-Frou, lean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, rather long pasterns, as though moved by springs.",
      "Not far from her they were taking the rug off the lop-eared Gladiator.",
      "The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines of the stallion, with his superb hind-quarters and excessively short pasterns almost over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky s attention in spite of himself.",
      "He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again detained by an acquaintance.",
      "Oh, there s Karenin!",
      "said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting.",
      "He s looking for his wife, and she s in the middle of the pavilion.",
      "Didn t you see her?",
      "No, answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round towards the pavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina, he went up to his mare.",
      "Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he had to give some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion to receive their numbers and places in the row at starting.",
      "Seventeen officers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met together in the pavilion and drew the numbers.",
      "Vronsky drew the number seven.",
      "The cry was heard: Mount!",
      "Feeling that with the others riding in the race, he was the center upon which all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his mare in that state of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and composed in his movements.",
      "Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar, which propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots.",
      "He was calm and dignified as ever, and was with his own hands holding Frou-Frou by both reins, standing straight in front of her.",
      "Frou-Frou was still trembling as though in a fever.",
      "Her eye, full of fire, glanced sideways at Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky slipped his finger under the saddle-girth.",
      "The mare glanced aslant at him, drew up her lip, and twitched her ear.",
      "The Englishman puckered up his lips, intending to indicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling.",
      "Get up; you won t feel so excited.",
      "Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals.",
      "He knew that he would not see them during the race.",
      "Two were already riding forward to the point from which they were to start.",
      "Galtsin, a friend of Vronsky s and one of his more formidable rivals, was moving round a bay horse that would not let him mount.",
      "A little light hussar in tight riding breeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in imitation of English jockeys.",
      "Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom led her by the bridle.",
      "Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and his peculiarity of weak nerves and terrible vanity.",
      "They knew that he was afraid of everything, afraid of riding a spirited horse.",
      "But now, just because it was terrible, because people broke their necks, and there was a doctor standing at each obstacle, and an ambulance with a cross on it, and a sister of mercy, he had made up his mind to take part in the race.",
      "Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him a friendly and encouraging nod.",
      "Only one he did not see, his chief rival, Mahotin on Gladiator.",
      "Don t be in a hurry, said Cord to Vronsky, and remember one thing: don t hold her in at the fences, and don t urge her on; let her go as she likes.",
      "All right, all right, said Vronsky, taking the reins.",
      "If you can, lead the race; but don t lose heart till the last minute, even if you re behind.",
      "Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile, vigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and firmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle.",
      "Getting his right foot in the stirrup, he smoothed the double reins, as he always did, between his fingers, and Cord let go.",
      "As though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started, dragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though she were on springs, shaking her rider from side to side.",
      "Cord quickened his step, following him.",
      "The excited mare, trying to shake off her rider first on one side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in vain with voice and hand to soothe her.",
      "They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the starting point.",
      "Several of the riders were in front and several behind, when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud behind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged, lop-eared Gladiator.",
      "Mahotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but Vronsky looked angrily at him.",
      "He did not like him, and regarded him now as his most formidable rival.",
      "He was angry with him for galloping past and exciting his mare.",
      "Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her left foot forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins, passed into a jolting trot, bumping her rider up and down.",
      "Cord, too, scowled, and followed Vronsky almost at a trot.",
      "Chapter 25 There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race.",
      "The race course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion.",
      "On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the stream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an Irish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be killed); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion.",
      "But the race began not in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part of the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in breadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.",
      "Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse thrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again.",
      "The umpire who was starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper, when at last for the fourth time he shouted Away!",
      "and the racers started.",
      "Every eye, every opera-glass, was turned on the brightly colored group of riders at the moment they were in line to start.",
      "They re off!",
      "They re starting!",
      "was heard on all sides after the hush of expectation.",
      "And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running from place to place to get a better view.",
      "In the very first minute the close group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were approaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another.",
      "To the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously, but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them.",
      "Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and several horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream, Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of him Mahotin s chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and in front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than alive.",
      "For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his mare.",
      "Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the motions of his mare.",
      "Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost under his mare s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream.",
      "(Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.)",
      "Those details Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just under him, where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana s legs or head might be in the way.",
      "But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of leaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted beyond her.",
      "O the darling!",
      "thought Vronsky.",
      "After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and began holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind Mahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five hundred yards that followed it.",
      "The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion.",
      "The Tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them at him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near the devil, as the solid barrier was called.",
      "Vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and keeping always the same distance ahead.",
      "Gladiator rose, with no sound of knocking against anything.",
      "With a wave of his short tail he disappeared from Vronsky s sight.",
      "cried a voice.",
      "At the same instant, under Vronsky s eyes, right before him flashed the palings of the barrier.",
      "Without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a crash behind him.",
      "The mare, excited by Gladiator s keeping ahead, had risen too soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind hoofs.",
      "But her pace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face, realized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator.",
      "Once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.",
      "At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts, without any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and began getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to the inner cord.",
      "Mahotin would not let her pass that side.",
      "Vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side, when Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side.",
      "Frou-Frou s shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was even with Gladiator s back.",
      "For a few lengths they moved evenly.",
      "But before the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the reins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly passed Mahotin just upon the declivity.",
      "He caught a glimpse of his mud-stained face as he flashed by.",
      "He even fancied that he smiled.",
      "Vronsky passed Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon him, and he never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.",
      "The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator closer upon him.",
      "He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she easily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator s hoofs was again heard at the same distance away.",
      "Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as Cord had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner.",
      "His excitement, his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener and keener.",
      "He longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this, and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept.",
      "There remained only one obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first.",
      "He was flying towards the Irish barricade, Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance, and both the man and the mare had a moment s hesitation.",
      "He saw the uncertainty in the mare s ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted.",
      "She quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had fancied she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the same rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell back into her pace again.",
      "Bravo, Vronsky!",
      "he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were his friends in the regiment who were standing at the obstacle.",
      "He could not fail to recognize Yashvin s voice though he did not see him.",
      "O my sweet!",
      "he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened for what was happening behind.",
      "He s cleared it!",
      "he thought, catching the thud of Gladiator s hoofs behind him.",
      "There remained only the last ditch, filled with water and five feet wide.",
      "Vronsky did not even look at it, but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins, lifting the mare s head and letting it go in time with her paces.",
      "He felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her neck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane, her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short, sharp gasps.",
      "But he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards.",
      "It was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace.",
      "She flew over the ditch as though not noticing it.",
      "She flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky, to his horror, felt that he had failed to keep up with the mare s pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a fearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle.",
      "All at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened.",
      "He could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop.",
      "Vronsky was touching the ground with one foot, and his mare was sinking on that foot.",
      "He just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird.",
      "The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her back.",
      "But that he only knew much later.",
      "At that moment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he stood staggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes.",
      "Still unable to realize what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his mare s reins.",
      "Again she struggled all over like a fish, and her shoulders setting the saddle heaving, she rose on her front legs but unable to lift her back, she quivered all over and again fell on her side.",
      "With a face hideous with passion, his lower jaw trembling, and his cheeks white, Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach and again fell to tugging at the rein.",
      "She did not stir, but thrusting her nose into the ground, she simply gazed at her master with her speaking eyes.",
      "A a a!",
      "groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head.",
      "The race lost!",
      "And my fault!",
      "shameful, unpardonable!",
      "And the poor darling, ruined mare!",
      "A crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of his regiment, ran up to him.",
      "To his misery he felt that he was whole and unhurt.",
      "The mare had broken her back, and it was decided to shoot her.",
      "Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone.",
      "He turned, and without picking up his cap that had fallen off, walked away from the race course, not knowing where he was going.",
      "He felt utterly wretched.",
      "For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of misfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his own fault.",
      "Yashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour later Vronsky had regained his self-possession.",
      "But the memory of that race remained for long in his heart, the cruelest and bitterest memory of his life.",
      "Chapter 26 The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had remained unchanged.",
      "The sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever.",
      "As in former years, at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his health, deranged by the winter s work that every year grew heavier.",
      "And just as always he returned in July and at once fell to work as usual with increased energy.",
      "As usual, too, his wife had moved for the summer to a villa out of town, while he remained in Petersburg.",
      "From the date of their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya s he had never spoken again to Anna of his suspicions and his jealousies, and that habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient tone possible for his present attitude to his wife.",
      "He was a little colder to his wife.",
      "He simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her for that first midnight conversation, which she had repelled.",
      "In his attitude to her there was a shade of vexation, but nothing more.",
      "You would not be open with me, he seemed to say, mentally addressing her; so much the worse for you.",
      "Now you may beg as you please, but I won t be open with you.",
      "So much the worse for you!",
      "he said mentally, like a man who, after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire, should fly in a rage with his vain efforts and say, Oh, very well then!",
      "you shall burn for this!",
      "This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not realize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife.",
      "He did not realize it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his actual position, and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family, that is, his wife and son.",
      "He who had been such a careful father, had from the end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, and adopted to him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife.",
      "Aha, young man!",
      "was the greeting with which he met him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any previous year had so much official business as that year.",
      "But he was not aware that he sought work for himself that year, that this was one of the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them, which became more terrible the longer they lay there.",
      "If anyone had had the right to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife s behavior, the mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made no answer, but he would have been greatly angered with any man who should question him on that subject.",
      "For this reason there positively came into Alexey Alexandrovitch s face a look of haughtiness and severity whenever anyone inquired after his wife s health.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife s behavior, and he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof, and the Countess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there, close to Anna, and constantly seeing her.",
      "That year Countess Lidia Ivanovna declined to settle in Peterhof, was not once at Anna Arkadyevna s, and in conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability of Anna s close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sternly cut her short, roundly declaring his wife to be above suspicion, and from that time began to avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "He did not want to see, and did not see, that many people in society cast dubious glances on his wife; he did not want to understand, and did not understand, why his wife had so particularly insisted on staying at Tsarskoe, where Betsy was staying, and not far from the camp of Vronsky s regiment.",
      "He did not allow himself to think about it, and he did not think about it; but all the same though he never admitted it to himself, and had no proofs, not even suspicious evidence, in the bottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived husband, and he was profoundly miserable about it.",
      "How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey Alexandrovitch had looked at other men s faithless wives and other deceived husbands and asked himself: How can people descend to that?",
      "how is it they don t put an end to such a hideous position?",
      "But now, when the misfortune had come upon himself, he was so far from thinking of putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at all, would not recognize it just because it was too awful, too unnatural.",
      "Since his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at their country villa.",
      "Once he dined there, another time he spent the evening there with a party of friends, but he had not once stayed the night there, as it had been his habit to do in previous years.",
      "The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey Alexandrovitch; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning, he made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner, and from there to the races, which all the Court were to witness, and at which he was bound to be present.",
      "He was going to see his wife, because he had determined to see her once a week to keep up appearances.",
      "And besides, on that day, as it was the fifteenth, he had to give his wife some money for her expenses, according to their usual arrangement.",
      "With his habitual control over his thoughts, though he thought all this about his wife, he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to her.",
      "That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "The evening before, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveler in China, who was staying in Petersburg, and with it she enclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself, as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to be useful.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet through in the evening, and finished it in the morning.",
      "Then people began arriving with petitions, and there came the reports, interviews, appointments, dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, grants, notes, the workaday round, as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it, that always took up so much time.",
      "Then there was private business of his own, a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his property.",
      "The steward did not take up much time.",
      "He simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as it had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses, more had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit.",
      "But the doctor, a celebrated Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate acquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him that day, and was surprised at his visit, and still more so when the doctor questioned him very carefully about his health, listened to his breathing, and tapped at his liver.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia Ivanovna, noticing that he was not as well as usual that year, had begged the doctor to go and examine him.",
      "Do this for my sake, the Countess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him.",
      "I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess, replied the doctor.",
      "A priceless man!",
      "said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He found the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers weakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without effect.",
      "He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as far as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry in other words, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch s power as abstaining from breathing.",
      "Then he withdrew, leaving in Alexey Alexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him, and that there was no chance of curing it.",
      "As he was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an acquaintance of his, Sludin, who was secretary of Alexey Alexandrovitch s department.",
      "They had been comrades at the university, and though they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were excellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the doctor would have given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.",
      "How glad I am you ve been seeing him!",
      "said Sludin.",
      "He s not well, and I fancy.... Well, what do you think of him?",
      "I ll tell you, said the doctor, beckoning over Sludin s head to his coachman to bring the carriage round.",
      "It s just this, said the doctor, taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it, if you don t strain the strings, and then try to break them, you ll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost, and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.",
      "And with his close assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his work, he s strained to the utmost; and there s some outside burden weighing on him, and not a light one, concluded the doctor, raising his eyebrows significantly.",
      "Will you be at the races?",
      "he added, as he sank into his seat in the carriage.",
      "Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time, the doctor responded vaguely to some reply of Sludin s he had not caught.",
      "Directly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came the celebrated traveler, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, by means of the pamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous acquaintance with the subject, impressed the traveler by the depth of his knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his view of it.",
      "At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial marshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg, with whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had to have some conversation.",
      "After his departure, he had to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary, and then he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage on a matter of grave and serious import.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch only just managed to be back by five o clock, his dinner-hour, and after dining with his secretary, he invited him to drive with him to his country villa and to the races.",
      "Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexey Alexandrovitch always tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his interviews with his wife.",
      "Chapter 27 Anna was upstairs, standing before the looking-glass, and, with Annushka s assistance, pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she heard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.",
      "It s too early for Betsy, she thought, and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey Alexandrovitch, and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each side of it.",
      "How unlucky!",
      "Can he be going to stay the night?",
      "she wondered, and the thought of all that might come of such a chance struck her as so awful and terrible that, without dwelling on it for a moment, she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face; and conscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in herself that she had come to know of late, she abandoned herself to that spirit and began talking, hardly knowing what she was saying.",
      "Ah, how nice of you!",
      "she said, giving her husband her hand, and greeting Sludin, who was like one of the family, with a smile.",
      "You re staying the night, I hope?",
      "was the first word the spirit of falsehood prompted her to utter; and now we ll go together.",
      "Only it s a pity I ve promised Betsy.",
      "She s coming for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy s name.",
      "Oh, I m not going to separate the inseparables, he said in his usual bantering tone.",
      "I m going with Mihail Vassilievitch.",
      "I m ordered exercise by the doctors too.",
      "I ll walk, and fancy myself at the springs again.",
      "There s no hurry, said Anna.",
      "Would you like tea?",
      "She rang.",
      "Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here.",
      "Well, tell me, how have you been?",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch, you ve not been to see me before.",
      "Look how lovely it is out on the terrace, she said, turning first to one and then to the other.",
      "She spoke very simply and naturally, but too much and too fast.",
      "She was the more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail Vassilievitch turned on her that he was, as it were, keeping watch on her.",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.",
      "She sat down beside her husband.",
      "You don t look quite well, she said.",
      "Yes, he said; the doctor s been with me today and wasted an hour of my time.",
      "I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him: my health s so precious, it seems.",
      "No; what did he say?",
      "She questioned him about his health and what he had been doing, and tried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her.",
      "All this she said brightly, rapidly, and with a peculiar brilliance in her eyes.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special significance to this tone of hers.",
      "He heard only her words and gave them only the direct sense they bore.",
      "And he answered simply, though jestingly.",
      "There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation, but never after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing pang of shame.",
      "Seryozha came in preceded by his governess.",
      "If Alexey Alexandrovitch had allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and bewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and then at his mother.",
      "But he would not see anything, and he did not see it.",
      "Ah, the young man!",
      "He s grown.",
      "Really, he s getting quite a man.",
      "How are you, young man?",
      "And he gave his hand to the scared child.",
      "Seryozha had been shy of his father before, and now, ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to calling him young man, and since that insoluble question had occurred to him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe, he avoided his father.",
      "He looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter.",
      "It was only with his mother that he was at ease.",
      "Meanwhile, Alexey Alexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was speaking to the governess, and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable that Anna saw he was on the point of tears.",
      "Anna, who had flushed a little the instant her son came in, noticing that Seryozha was uncomfortable, got up hurriedly, took Alexey Alexandrovitch s hand from her son s shoulder, and kissing the boy, led him out onto the terrace, and quickly came back.",
      "It s time to start, though, said she, glancing at her watch.",
      "How is it Betsy doesn t come?...",
      "Yes, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and getting up, he folded his hands and cracked his fingers.",
      "I ve come to bring you some money, too, for nightingales, we know, can t live on fairy tales, he said.",
      "You want it, I expect?",
      "No, I don t ... yes, I do, she said, not looking at him, and crimsoning to the roots of her hair.",
      "But you ll come back here after the races, I suppose?",
      "answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And here s the glory of Peterhof, Princess Tverskaya, he added, looking out of the window at the elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high.",
      "What elegance!",
      "Charming!",
      "Well, let us be starting too, then.",
      "Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage, but her groom, in high boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance.",
      "I m going; good-bye!",
      "said Anna, and kissing her son, she went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him.",
      "It was ever so nice of you to come.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.",
      "Well, _au revoir_, then!",
      "You ll come back for some tea; that s delightful!",
      "she said, and went out, gay and radiant.",
      "But as soon as she no longer saw him, she was aware of the spot on her hand that his lips had touched, and she shuddered with repulsion.",
      "Chapter 28 When Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course, Anna was already sitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where all the highest society had gathered.",
      "She caught sight of her husband in the distance.",
      "Two men, her husband and her lover, were the two centers of her existence, and unaided by her external senses she was aware of their nearness.",
      "She was aware of her husband approaching a long way off, and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the midst of which he was moving.",
      "She watched his progress towards the pavilion, saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating bow, now exchanging friendly, nonchalant greetings with his equals, now assiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world, and taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears.",
      "All these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her.",
      "Nothing but ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that s all there is in his soul, she thought; as for these lofty ideals, love of culture, religion, they are only so many tools for getting on.",
      "From his glances towards the ladies pavilion (he was staring straight at her, but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin, ribbons, feathers, parasols and flowers) she saw that he was looking for her, but she purposely avoided noticing him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "Princess Betsy called to him; I m sure you don t see your wife: here she is.",
      "He smiled his chilly smile.",
      "There s so much splendor here that one s eyes are dazzled, he said, and he went into the pavilion.",
      "He smiled to his wife as a man should smile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her, and greeted the princess and other acquaintances, giving to each what was due that is to say, jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings among the men.",
      "Below, near the pavilion, was standing an adjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion, noted for his intelligence and culture.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch entered into conversation with him.",
      "There was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered conversation.",
      "The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them.",
      "Anna heard his high, measured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her as false, and stabbed her ears with pain.",
      "When the three-mile steeplechase was beginning, she bent forward and gazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and mounted, and at the same time she heard that loathsome, never-ceasing voice of her husband.",
      "She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, but a still greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed to her, stream of her husband s shrill voice with its familiar intonations.",
      "I m a wicked woman, a lost woman, she thought; but I don t like lying, I can t endure falsehood, while as for _him_ (her husband) it s the breath of his life falsehood.",
      "He knows all about it, he sees it all; what does he care if he can talk so calmly?",
      "If he were to kill me, if he were to kill Vronsky, I might respect him.",
      "No, all he wants is falsehood and propriety, Anna said to herself, not considering exactly what it was she wanted of her husband, and how she would have liked to see him behave.",
      "She did not understand either that Alexey Alexandrovitch s peculiar loquacity that day, so exasperating to her, was merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness.",
      "As a child that has been hurt skips about, putting all his muscles into movement to drown the pain, in the same way Alexey Alexandrovitch needed mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her presence and in Vronsky s, and with the continual iteration of his name, would force themselves on his attention.",
      "And it was as natural for him to talk well and cleverly, as it is natural for a child to skip about.",
      "He was saying: Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential element in the race.",
      "If England can point to the most brilliant feats of cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men.",
      "Sport has, in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see nothing but what is most superficial.",
      "It s not superficial, said Princess Tverskaya.",
      "One of the officers, they say, has broken two ribs.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile, which uncovered his teeth, but revealed nothing more.",
      "We ll admit, princess, that that s not superficial, he said, but internal.",
      "But that s not the point, and he turned again to the general with whom he was talking seriously; we mustn t forget that those who are taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side.",
      "It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer.",
      "Low sports, such as prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of barbarity.",
      "But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.",
      "No, I shan t come another time; it s too upsetting, said Princess Betsy.",
      "Isn t it, Anna?",
      "It is upsetting, but one can t tear oneself away, said another lady.",
      "If I d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.",
      "Anna said nothing, and keeping her opera-glass up, gazed always at the same spot.",
      "At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion.",
      "Breaking off what he was saying, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly, though with dignity, and bowed low to the general.",
      "You re not racing?",
      "the officer asked, chaffing him.",
      "My race is a harder one, Alexey Alexandrovitch responded deferentially.",
      "And though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though he had heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished _la pointe de la sauce_.",
      "There are two aspects, Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed: those who take part and those who look on; and love for such spectacles is an unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator, I admit, but.... Princess, bets!",
      "sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch s voice from below, addressing Betsy.",
      "Who s your favorite?",
      "Anna and I are for Kuzovlev, replied Betsy.",
      "I m for Vronsky.",
      "A pair of gloves?",
      "Done!",
      "But it is a pretty sight, isn t it?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him, but he began again directly.",
      "I admit that manly sports do not.... he was continuing.",
      "But at that moment the racers started, and all conversation ceased.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned towards the stream.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race, and so he did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the spectators with his weary eyes.",
      "His eyes rested upon Anna.",
      "Her face was white and set.",
      "She was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man.",
      "Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan, and she held her breath.",
      "He looked at her and hastily turned away, scrutinizing other faces.",
      "But here s this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it s very natural, Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.",
      "He tried not to look at her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her.",
      "He examined that face again, trying not to read what was so plainly written on it, and against his own will, with horror read on it what he did not want to know.",
      "The first fall Kuzovlev s, at the stream agitated everyone, but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna s pale, triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen.",
      "When, after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her.",
      "But more and more often, and with greater persistence, he watched her.",
      "Anna, wholly engrossed as she was with the race, became aware of her husband s cold eyes fixed upon her from one side.",
      "She glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, and with a slight frown turned away again.",
      "Ah, I don t care!",
      "she seemed to say to him, and she did not once glance at him again.",
      "The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in it more than half were thrown and hurt.",
      "Towards the end of the race everyone was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact that the Tsar was displeased.",
      "Chapter 29 Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered The lions and gladiators will be the next thing, and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when Vronsky fell to the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the way in it.",
      "But afterwards a change came over Anna s face which really was beyond decorum.",
      "She utterly lost her head.",
      "She began fluttering like a caged bird, at one moment would have got up and moved away, at the next turned to Betsy.",
      "Let us go, let us go!",
      "But Betsy did not hear her.",
      "She was bending down, talking to a general who had come up to her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his arm.",
      "Let us go, if you like, he said in French, but Anna was listening to the general and did not notice her husband.",
      "He s broken his leg too, so they say, the general was saying.",
      "This is beyond everything.",
      "Without answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera-glass and gazed towards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and there was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out nothing.",
      "She laid down the opera-glass, and would have moved away, but at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the Tsar.",
      "Anna craned forward, listening.",
      "she cried to her brother.",
      "But her brother did not hear her.",
      "Again she would have moved away.",
      "Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, reaching towards her hand.",
      "She drew back from him with aversion, and without looking in his face answered: No, no, let me be, I ll stay.",
      "She saw now that from the place of Vronsky s accident an officer was running across the course towards the pavilion.",
      "Betsy waved her handkerchief to him.",
      "The officer brought the news that the rider was not killed, but the horse had broken its back.",
      "On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her face in her fan.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping, and could not control her tears, nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stood so as to screen her, giving her time to recover herself.",
      "For the third time I offer you my arm, he said to her after a little time, turning to her.",
      "Anna gazed at him and did not know what to say.",
      "Princess Betsy came to her rescue.",
      "No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take her home, put in Betsy.",
      "Excuse me, princess, he said, smiling courteously but looking her very firmly in the face, but I see that Anna s not very well, and I wish her to come home with me.",
      "Anna looked about her in a frightened way, got up submissively, and laid her hand on her husband s arm.",
      "I ll send to him and find out, and let you know, Betsy whispered to her.",
      "As they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to those he met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she was utterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her husband s arm as though in a dream.",
      "Is he killed or not?",
      "Is it true?",
      "Will he come or not?",
      "Shall I see him today?",
      "she was thinking.",
      "She took her seat in her husband s carriage in silence, and in silence drove out of the crowd of carriages.",
      "In spite of all he had seen, Alexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his wife s real condition.",
      "He merely saw the outward symptoms.",
      "He saw that she was behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his duty to tell her so.",
      "But it was very difficult for him not to say more, to tell her nothing but that.",
      "He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved unbecomingly, but he could not help saying something utterly different.",
      "What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel spectacles, he said.",
      "I observe.... Eh?",
      "I don t understand, said Anna contemptuously.",
      "He was offended, and at once began to say what he had meant to say.",
      "I am obliged to tell you, he began.",
      "So now we are to have it out, she thought, and she felt frightened.",
      "I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming today, he said to her in French.",
      "In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?",
      "she said aloud, turning her head swiftly and looking him straight in the face, not with the bright expression that seemed covering something, but with a look of determination, under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she was feeling.",
      "Mind, he said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman.",
      "He got up and pulled up the window.",
      "What did you consider unbecoming?",
      "The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the riders.",
      "He waited for her to answer, but she was silent, looking straight before her.",
      "I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you.",
      "There was a time when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that now.",
      "Now I speak only of your external attitude.",
      "You have behaved improperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.",
      "She did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken before him, and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not killed.",
      "Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt, but the horse had broken its back?",
      "She merely smiled with a pretense of irony when he finished, and made no reply, because she had not heard what he said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak boldly, but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of, the dismay she was feeling infected him too.",
      "He saw the smile, and a strange misapprehension came over him.",
      "She is smiling at my suspicions.",
      "Yes, she will tell me directly what she told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that it s absurd.",
      "At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him, there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless.",
      "So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe anything.",
      "But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy, did not now promise even deception.",
      "Possibly I was mistaken, said he.",
      "If so, I beg your pardon.",
      "No, you were not mistaken, she said deliberately, looking desperately into his cold face.",
      "You were not mistaken.",
      "I was, and I could not help being in despair.",
      "I hear you, but I am thinking of him.",
      "I love him, I am his mistress; I can t bear you; I m afraid of you, and I hate you.... You can do what you like to me.",
      "And dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she broke into sobs, hiding her face in her hands.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and kept looking straight before him.",
      "But his whole face suddenly bore the solemn rigidity of the dead, and his expression did not change during the whole time of the drive home.",
      "On reaching the house he turned his head to her, still with the same expression.",
      "Very well!",
      "But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time his voice shook as I may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you.",
      "He got out first and helped her to get out.",
      "Before the servants he pressed her hand, took his seat in the carriage, and drove back to Petersburg.",
      "Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy and brought Anna a note.",
      "I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite well and unhurt, but in despair.",
      "So _he_ will be here, she thought.",
      "What a good thing I told him all!",
      "She glanced at her watch.",
      "She had still three hours to wait, and the memories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.",
      "My God, how light it is!",
      "It s dreadful, but I do love to see his face, and I do love this fantastic light.... My husband!",
      "yes.... Well, thank God!",
      "everything s over with him.",
      "Chapter 30 In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of society went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place.",
      "Just as the particle of water in frost, definitely and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of snow, so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special place.",
      "_F rst_ Shtcherbatsky, _sammt Gemahlin und Tochter_, by the apartments they took, and from their name and from the friends they made, were immediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.",
      "There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German F rstin, in consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more vigorously than ever.",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything, to present her daughter to this German princess, and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite.",
      "Kitty made a low and graceful curtsey in the _very simple_, that is to say, very elegant frock that had been ordered her from Paris.",
      "The German princess said, I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face, and for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing.",
      "The Shtcherbatskys made the acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and of a German countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a learned Swede, and of M. Canut and his sister.",
      "But yet inevitably the Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a Moscow colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there was no getting rid of him.",
      "When all this was so firmly established, Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother.",
      "She took no interest in the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them.",
      "Her chief mental interest in the watering-place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know.",
      "It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible, especially so in those she did not know.",
      "And now as she made surmises as to who people were, what were their relations to one another, and what they were like, Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of her idea in her observations.",
      "Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame Stahl, as everyone called her.",
      "Madame Stahl belonged to the highest society, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage.",
      "But it was not so much from ill-health as from pride so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it that Madame Stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there.",
      "The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as Kitty observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the most natural way.",
      "This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered, related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant.",
      "Madame Stahl called her Varenka, and other people called her Mademoiselle Varenka.",
      "Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl s relations with Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often happened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, and was aware when their eyes met that she too liked her.",
      "Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty.",
      "If her features were criticized separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly hue of her face.",
      "She would have been a good figure, too, if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head, which was too large for her medium height.",
      "But she was not likely to be attractive to men.",
      "She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered.",
      "Moreover, she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of her own attractiveness.",
      "She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt, and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it.",
      "It was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka.",
      "Kitty felt that in her, in her manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a purchaser.",
      "The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.",
      "The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they met, Kitty s eyes said: Who are you?",
      "What are you?",
      "Are you really the exquisite creature I imagine you to be?",
      "But for goodness sake don t suppose, her eyes added, that I would force my acquaintance on you, I simply admire you and like you.",
      "I like you too, and you re very, very sweet.",
      "And I should like you better still, if I had time, answered the eyes of the unknown girl.",
      "Kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.",
      "Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the springs, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in it, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying cakes for tea for someone.",
      "Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention.",
      "These were a tall man with a stooping figure, and huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and tastelessly dressed.",
      "Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them.",
      "But the princess, having ascertained from the visitors list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her fancies about these two people vanished.",
      "Not so much from what her mother told her, as from the fact that it was Konstantin s brother, this pair suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant.",
      "This Levin, with his continual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust.",
      "It seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried to avoid meeting him.",
      "Chapter 31 It was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.",
      "Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel, smart and jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort.",
      "They were walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who was walking on the other side.",
      "Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they exchanged friendly glances.",
      "Mamma, couldn t I speak to her?",
      "said Kitty, watching her unknown friend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they might come there together.",
      "Oh, if you want to so much, I ll find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself, answered her mother.",
      "What do you see in her out of the way?",
      "A companion, she must be.",
      "If you like, I ll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-s ur_, added the princess, lifting her head haughtily.",
      "Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed to avoid making her acquaintance.",
      "Kitty did not insist.",
      "How wonderfully sweet she is!",
      "she said, gazing at Varenka just as she handed a glass to the Frenchwoman.",
      "Look how natural and sweet it all is.",
      "It s so funny to see your _engouements_, said the princess.",
      "No, we d better go back, she added, noticing Levin coming towards them with his companion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and angrily.",
      "They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but shouting.",
      "Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the doctor, too, was excited.",
      "A crowd gathered about them.",
      "The princess and Kitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find out what was the matter.",
      "A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.",
      "inquired the princess.",
      "Scandalous and disgraceful!",
      "answered the colonel.",
      "The one thing to be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad.",
      "That tall gentleman was abusing the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn t treating him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him.",
      "It s simply a scandal!",
      "Oh, how unpleasant!",
      "said the princess.",
      "Well, and how did it end?",
      "Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ... intervened.",
      "A Russian lady, I think she is, said the colonel.",
      "Mademoiselle Varenka?",
      "She came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by the arm and led him away.",
      "There, mamma, said Kitty; you wonder that I m enthusiastic about her.",
      "The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his companion as with her other _prot g s_.",
      "She went up to them, entered into conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman, who could not speak any foreign language.",
      "Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make friends with Varenka.",
      "And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of Madame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries about Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there could be no harm though little good in the acquaintance, she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with her.",
      "Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while Varenka had stopped outside the baker s, the princess went up to her.",
      "Allow me to make your acquaintance, she said, with her dignified smile.",
      "My daughter has lost her heart to you, she said.",
      "Possibly you do not know me.",
      "I am.... That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess, Varenka answered hurriedly.",
      "What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!",
      "Varenka flushed a little.",
      "I don t remember.",
      "I don t think I did anything, she said.",
      "Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.",
      "Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he s very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor.",
      "I m used to looking after such invalids.",
      "Yes, I ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt I think Madame Stahl: I used to know her _belle-s ur_.",
      "No, she s not my aunt.",
      "I call her mamma, but I am not related to her; I was brought up by her, answered Varenka, flushing a little again.",
      "This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such a fancy to Varenka.",
      "Well, and what s this Levin going to do?",
      "asked the princess.",
      "He s going away, answered Varenka.",
      "At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.",
      "Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle.... Varenka, Varenka put in smiling, that s what everyone calls me.",
      "Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her new friend s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay motionless in her hand.",
      "The hand did not respond to her pressure, but the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.",
      "I have long wished for this too, she said.",
      "But you are so busy.",
      "Oh, no, I m not at all busy, answered Varenka, but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls, children of an invalid, ran up to her.",
      "Varenka, mamma s calling!",
      "they cried.",
      "And Varenka went after them.",
      "Chapter 32 The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka s past and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows: Madame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament.",
      "When, after her separation from her husband, she gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost immediately, and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility, and fearing the news would kill her, had substituted another child, a baby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg, the daughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household.",
      "This was Varenka.",
      "Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child, but she went on bringing her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of her own living.",
      "Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch.",
      "And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social position as a philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to be.",
      "No one knew what her faith was Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox.",
      "But one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.",
      "Varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called her.",
      "Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to in her daughter s intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka s breeding and education were of the best she spoke French and English extremely well and what was of the most weight, brought a message from Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill health from making the acquaintance of the princess.",
      "After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.",
      "The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come and sing to them in the evening.",
      "Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it s true, but you will give us so much pleasure, said the princess with her affected smile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed that Varenka had no inclination to sing.",
      "Varenka came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her.",
      "The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.",
      "Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did not know, and she went directly to the piano.",
      "She could not accompany herself, but she could sing music at sight very well.",
      "Kitty, who played well, accompanied her.",
      "You have an extraordinary talent, the princess said to her after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.",
      "Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration.",
      "Look, said the colonel, looking out of the window, what an audience has collected to listen to you.",
      "There actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows.",
      "I am very glad it gives you pleasure, Varenka answered simply.",
      "Kitty looked with pride at her friend.",
      "She was enchanted by her talent, and her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way Varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved by their praises.",
      "She seemed only to be asking: Am I to sing again, or is that enough?",
      "If it had been I, thought Kitty, how proud I should have been!",
      "How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows!",
      "But she s utterly unmoved by it.",
      "Her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please mamma.",
      "What is there in her?",
      "What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
      "How I should like to know it and to learn it of her!",
      "thought Kitty, gazing into her serene face.",
      "The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and Varenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin, dark-skinned hand.",
      "The next song in the book was an Italian one.",
      "Kitty played the opening bars, and looked round at Varenka.",
      "Let s skip that, said Varenka, flushing a little.",
      "Kitty let her eyes rest on Varenka s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.",
      "Very well, the next one, she said hurriedly, turning over the pages, and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.",
      "No, answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, no, let s have that one.",
      "And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as well as the others.",
      "When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.",
      "Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house.",
      "Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?",
      "Don t tell me, she added hastily, only say if I m right.",
      "No, why not?",
      "I ll tell you simply, said Varenka, and, without waiting for a reply, she went on: Yes, it brings up memories, once painful ones.",
      "I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.",
      "Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at Varenka.",
      "I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it, and he married another girl.",
      "He s living now not far from us, and I see him sometimes.",
      "You didn t think I had a love story too, she said, and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty felt must once have glowed all over her.",
      "I didn t think so?",
      "Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone else after knowing you.",
      "Only I can t understand how he could, to please his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.",
      "Oh, no, he s a very good man, and I m not unhappy; quite the contrary, I m very happy.",
      "Well, so we shan t be singing any more now, she added, turning towards the house.",
      "How good you are!",
      "cried Kitty, and stopping her, she kissed her.",
      "If I could only be even a little like you!",
      "Why should you be like anyone?",
      "You re nice as you are, said Varenka, smiling her gentle, weary smile.",
      "No, I m not nice at all.",
      "Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let s sit down, said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her.",
      "Tell me, isn t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he hasn t cared for it?...",
      "But he didn t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a dutiful son....",
      "Yes, but if it hadn t been on account of his mother, if it had been his own doing?...",
      "said Kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret, and that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her already.",
      "In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted him, answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her, but of Kitty.",
      "But the humiliation, said Kitty, the humiliation one can never forget, can never forget, she said, remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music.",
      "Where is the humiliation?",
      "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
      "Worse than wrong shameful.",
      "Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty s hand.",
      "Why, what is there shameful?",
      "You didn t tell a man, who didn t care for you, that you loved him, did you?",
      "Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it.",
      "No, no, there are looks, there are ways; I can t forget it, if I live a hundred years.",
      "Why so?",
      "I don t understand.",
      "The whole point is whether you love him now or not, said Varenka, who called everything by its name.",
      "I hate him; I can t forgive myself.",
      "Why, what for?",
      "The shame, the humiliation!",
      "if everyone were as sensitive as you are!",
      "said Varenka.",
      "There isn t a girl who hasn t been through the same.",
      "And it s all so unimportant.",
      "Why, what is important?",
      "said Kitty, looking into her face with inquisitive wonder.",
      "Oh, there s so much that s important, said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Why, what?",
      "Oh, so much that s more important, answered Varenka, not knowing what to say.",
      "But at that instant they heard the princess s voice from the window.",
      "Kitty, it s cold!",
      "Either get a shawl, or come indoors.",
      "It really is time to go in!",
      "said Varenka, getting up.",
      "I have to go on to Madame Berthe s; she asked me to.",
      "Kitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her: What is it, what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquillity?",
      "You know, tell me!",
      "But Varenka did not even know what Kitty s eyes were asking her.",
      "She merely thought that she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste home in time for _maman s_ tea at twelve o clock.",
      "She went indoors, collected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.",
      "Allow me to see you home, said the colonel.",
      "Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?",
      "chimed in the princess.",
      "Anyway, I ll send Parasha.",
      "Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort.",
      "No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me, she said, taking her hat.",
      "And kissing Kitty once more, without saying what was important, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity so much to be envied.",
      "Chapter 33 Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance, together with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a great influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.",
      "She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly.",
      "It was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life.",
      "This life was disclosed in religion, but a religion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known from childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night services at the Widow s Home, where one might meet one s friends, and in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest.",
      "This was a lofty, mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to, which one could love.",
      "Kitty found all this out not from words.",
      "Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of Christ s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately talked of other things.",
      "But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every word, in every heavenly as Kitty called it look, and above all in the whole story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized that something that was important, of which, till then, she had known nothing.",
      "Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl s character was, touching as was her story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her.",
      "She noticed that when questioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness.",
      "She noticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her, Madame Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and had smiled in a peculiar way.",
      "Trivial as these two observations were, they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl.",
      "But on the other hand Varenka, alone in the world, without friends or relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which Kitty dared hardly dream.",
      "In Varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble.",
      "And that was what Kitty longed to be.",
      "Seeing now clearly what was _the most important_, Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her.",
      "From Varenka s accounts of the doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life.",
      "She would, like Madame Stahl s niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great deal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, help them as far as she could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to the sick, to criminals, to the dying.",
      "The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty.",
      "But all these were secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or to Varenka.",
      "While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale, however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of Varenka.",
      "At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the influence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for Madame Stahl, and still more for Varenka.",
      "She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate Varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes.",
      "But later on the princess noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter.",
      "The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that Madame Stahl had given her a thing she had never done before; that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under Varenka s protection, and especially one poor family, that of a sick painter, Petrov.",
      "Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family.",
      "All this was well enough, and the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov s wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess, noticing Kitty s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of consolation.",
      "All this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration.",
      "But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes, and so indeed she told her.",
      "_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_, she said to her.",
      "Her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.",
      "What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give one s cloak if one s coat were taken?",
      "But the princess disliked this exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart.",
      "Kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother.",
      "She concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply because she was her mother.",
      "She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother.",
      "How is it Anna Pavlovna s not been to see us for so long?",
      "the princess said one day of Madame Petrova.",
      "I ve asked her, but she seems put out about something.",
      "No, I ve not noticed it, maman, said Kitty, flushing hotly.",
      "Is it long since you went to see them?",
      "We re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow, answered Kitty.",
      "Well, you can go, answered the princess, gazing at her daughter s embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.",
      "That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow.",
      "And the princess noticed again that Kitty reddened.",
      "Kitty, haven t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?",
      "said the princess, when they were left alone.",
      "Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?",
      "Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her.",
      "Kitty answered perfectly truly.",
      "She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had changed to her, but she guessed it.",
      "She guessed at something which she could not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.",
      "It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.",
      "Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family.",
      "She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round, good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him out-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her my Kitty, and would not go to bed without her.",
      "How nice it all was!",
      "Then she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his long neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence.",
      "She recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him, as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him.",
      "She recalled the timid, softened look with which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which she had felt at it.",
      "But all that was at first.",
      "Now, a few days ago, everything was suddenly spoiled.",
      "Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband.",
      "Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of Anna Pavlovna s coolness?",
      "Yes, she mused, there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna, and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day before yesterday: There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn t drink his coffee without you, though he s grown so dreadfully weak.",
      "Yes, perhaps, too, she didn t like it when I gave him the rug.",
      "It was all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking me, that I felt awkward too.",
      "And then that portrait of me he did so well.",
      "And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness!",
      "Yes, yes, that s it!",
      "Kitty repeated to herself with horror.",
      "No, it can t be, it oughtn t to be!",
      "He s so much to be pitied!",
      "she said to herself directly after.",
      "This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.",
      "Chapter 34 Before the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince Shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friends to get a breath of Russian air, as he said came back to his wife and daughter.",
      "The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed.",
      "The princess thought everything delightful, and in spite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad to be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she was affected, which did not altogether suit her.",
      "The prince, on the contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European life, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself abroad less European than he was in reality.",
      "The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind.",
      "His good humor was even greater when he saw Kitty completely recovered.",
      "The news of Kitty s friendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports the princess gave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty, troubled the prince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that drew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might have got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to him.",
      "But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of kindliness and good humor which was always within him, and more so than ever since his course of Carlsbad waters.",
      "The day after his arrival the prince, in his long overcoat, with his Russian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.",
      "It was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good.",
      "But the nearer they got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their appearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions of prosperous German life.",
      "Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.",
      "The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she watched.",
      "But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June morning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in fashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants, seemed something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these slowly moving, dying figures gathered together from all parts of Europe.",
      "In spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return of youth, with his favorite daughter on his arm, he felt awkward, and almost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy, stout limbs.",
      "He felt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd.",
      "Present me to your new friends, he said to his daughter, squeezing her hand with his elbow.",
      "I like even your horrid Soden for making you so well again.",
      "Only it s melancholy, very melancholy here.",
      "Who s that?",
      "Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom she was acquainted and some not.",
      "At the entrance of the garden they met the blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her guide, and the prince was delighted to see the old Frenchwoman s face light up when she heard Kitty s voice.",
      "She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated politeness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter, extolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a treasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.",
      "Well, she s the second angel, then, said the prince, smiling.",
      "she calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.",
      "Mademoiselle Varenka, she s a real angel, allez, Madame Berthe assented.",
      "In the arcade they met Varenka herself.",
      "She was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag.",
      "Here is papa come, Kitty said to her.",
      "Varenka made simply and naturally as she did everything a movement between a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the prince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.",
      "Of course I know you; I know you very well, the prince said to her with a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her father liked her friend.",
      "Where are you off to in such haste?",
      "Maman s here, she said, turning to Kitty.",
      "She has not slept all night, and the doctor advised her to go out.",
      "I m taking her her work.",
      "So that s angel number one?",
      "said the prince when Varenka had gone on.",
      "Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka, but that he could not do it because he liked her.",
      "Come, so we shall see all your friends, he went on, even Madame Stahl, if she deigns to recognize me.",
      "Why, did you know her, papa?",
      "Kitty asked apprehensively, catching the gleam of irony that kindled in the prince s eyes at the mention of Madame Stahl.",
      "I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she d joined the Pietists.",
      "What is a Pietist, papa?",
      "asked Kitty, dismayed to find that what she prized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name.",
      "I don t quite know myself.",
      "I only know that she thanks God for everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her husband died.",
      "And that s rather droll, as they didn t get on together.",
      "What a piteous face!",
      "he asked, noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs.",
      "This man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and high forehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.",
      "That s Petrov, an artist, answered Kitty, blushing.",
      "And that s his wife, she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose, at the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had run off along a path.",
      "Poor fellow!",
      "and what a nice face he has!",
      "Why don t you go up to him?",
      "He wanted to speak to you.",
      "Well, let us go, then, said Kitty, turning round resolutely.",
      "How are you feeling today?",
      "she asked Petrov.",
      "Petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.",
      "This is my daughter, said the prince.",
      "Let me introduce myself.",
      "The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white teeth.",
      "We expected you yesterday, princess, he said to Kitty.",
      "He staggered as he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem as if it had been intentional.",
      "I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you were not going.",
      "Not going!",
      "said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough, and his eyes sought his wife.",
      "Anita!",
      "he said loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.",
      "Anna Pavlovna came up.",
      "So you sent word to the princess that we weren t going!",
      "he whispered to her angrily, losing his voice.",
      "Good morning, princess, said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed smile utterly unlike her former manner.",
      "Very glad to make your acquaintance, she said to the prince.",
      "You ve long been expected, prince.",
      "What did you send word to the princess that we weren t going for?",
      "the artist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously exasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his words the expression he would have liked to.",
      "Oh, mercy on us!",
      "I thought we weren t going, his wife answered crossly.",
      "What, when....",
      "He coughed and waved his hand.",
      "The prince took off his hat and moved away with his daughter.",
      "he sighed deeply.",
      "Oh, poor things!",
      "Yes, papa, answered Kitty.",
      "And you must know they ve three children, no servant, and scarcely any means.",
      "He gets something from the Academy, she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the queer change in Anna Pavlovna s manner to her had aroused in her.",
      "Oh, here s Madame Stahl, said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage, where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade.",
      "This was Madame Stahl.",
      "Behind her stood the gloomy, healthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage.",
      "Close by was standing a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name.",
      "Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the lady as though she were some curiosity.",
      "The prince went up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam of irony in his eyes.",
      "He went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her with extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so few speak nowadays.",
      "I don t know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you for your kindness to my daughter, he said, taking off his hat and not putting it on again.",
      "Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky, said Madame Stahl, lifting upon him her heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of annoyance.",
      "Delighted!",
      "I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.",
      "You are still in weak health?",
      "Yes; I m used to it, said Madame Stahl, and she introduced the prince to the Swedish count.",
      "You are scarcely changed at all, the prince said to her.",
      "It s ten or eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.",
      "Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it.",
      "Often one wonders what is the goal of this life?...",
      "The other side!",
      "she said angrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her satisfaction.",
      "To do good, probably, said the prince with a twinkle in his eye.",
      "That is not for us to judge, said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade of expression on the prince s face.",
      "So you will send me that book, dear count?",
      "I m very grateful to you, she said to the young Swede.",
      "cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing near, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his daughter and the Moscow colonel, who joined them.",
      "That s our aristocracy, prince!",
      "the Moscow colonel said with ironical intention.",
      "He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl for not making his acquaintance.",
      "She s just the same, replied the prince.",
      "Did you know her before her illness, prince that s to say before she took to her bed?",
      "She took to her bed before my eyes, said the prince.",
      "They say it s ten years since she has stood on her feet.",
      "She doesn t stand up because her legs are too short.",
      "She s a very bad figure.",
      "Papa, it s not possible!",
      "cried Kitty.",
      "That s what wicked tongues say, my darling.",
      "And your Varenka catches it too, he added.",
      "Oh, these invalid ladies!",
      "Oh, no, papa!",
      "Kitty objected warmly.",
      "Varenka worships her.",
      "And then she does so much good!",
      "Ask anyone!",
      "Everyone knows her and Aline Stahl.",
      "Perhaps so, said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow; but it s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one knows.",
      "Kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because she did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father.",
      "But, strange to say, although she had so made up her mind not to be influenced by her father s views, not to let him into her inmost sanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl, which she had carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to return, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown down at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment lying there.",
      "All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay down because she had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not arranging her rug to her liking.",
      "And by no effort of the imagination could Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl.",
      "Chapter 35 The prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his friends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the Shtcherbatskys were staying.",
      "On coming back with Kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked the colonel, and Marya Yevgenyevna, and Varenka all to come and have coffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there.",
      "The landlord and the servants, too, grew brisker under the influence of his good spirits.",
      "They knew his open-handedness; and half an hour later the invalid doctor from Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked enviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians assembled under the chestnut tree.",
      "In the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set with coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and bread-and-butter.",
      "At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and talking loudly and merrily.",
      "The prince had spread out near him his purchases, carved boxes, and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts, of which he bought a heap at every watering-place, and bestowed them upon everyone, including Lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord, with whom he jested in his comically bad German, assuring him that it was not the water had cured Kitty, but his splendid cookery, especially his plum soup.",
      "The princess laughed at her husband for his Russian ways, but she was more lively and good-humored than she had been all the while she had been at the waters.",
      "The colonel smiled, as he always did, at the prince s jokes, but as far as regards Europe, of which he believed himself to be making a careful study, he took the princess s side.",
      "The simple-hearted Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter at everything absurd the prince said, and his jokes made Varenka helpless with feeble but infectious laughter, which was something Kitty had never seen before.",
      "Kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted.",
      "She could not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his good-humored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted her.",
      "To this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with the Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked that morning.",
      "Everyone was good-humored, but Kitty could not feel good-humored, and this increased her distress.",
      "She felt a feeling such as she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a punishment, and had heard her sisters merry laughter outside.",
      "Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?",
      "said the princess, smiling, and handing her husband a cup of coffee.",
      "One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy.",
      "_Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?_ Directly they say _Durchlaucht_, I can t hold out.",
      "I lose ten thalers.",
      "It s simply from boredom, said the princess.",
      "Of course it is.",
      "Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn t know what to do with oneself.",
      "How can you be bored, prince?",
      "There s so much that s interesting now in Germany, said Marya Yevgenyevna.",
      "But I know everything that s interesting: the plum soup I know, and the pea sausages I know.",
      "I know everything.",
      "No, you may say what you like, prince, there s the interest of their institutions, said the colonel.",
      "But what is there interesting about it?",
      "They re all as pleased as brass halfpence.",
      "They ve conquered everybody, and why am I to be pleased at that?",
      "I haven t conquered anyone; and I m obliged to take off my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up and dress at once, and go to the dining-room to drink bad tea!",
      "How different it is at home!",
      "You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble a little, and come round again.",
      "You ve time to think things over, and no hurry.",
      "But time s money, you forget that, said the colonel.",
      "Time, indeed, that depends!",
      "Why, there s time one would give a month of for sixpence, and time you wouldn t give half an hour of for any money.",
      "Isn t that so, Katinka?",
      "What is it?",
      "why are you so depressed?",
      "I m not depressed.",
      "Stay a little longer, he said to Varenka.",
      "I must be going home, said Varenka, getting up, and again she went off into a giggle.",
      "When she had recovered, she said good-bye, and went into the house to get her hat.",
      "Kitty followed her.",
      "Even Varenka struck her as different.",
      "She was not worse, but different from what she had fancied her before.",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "it s a long while since I ve laughed so much!",
      "said Varenka, gathering up her parasol and her bag.",
      "How nice he is, your father!",
      "Kitty did not speak.",
      "When shall I see you again?",
      "asked Varenka.",
      "Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs.",
      "Won t you be there?",
      "said Kitty, to try Varenka.",
      "Yes, answered Varenka.",
      "They re getting ready to go away, so I promised to help them pack.",
      "Well, I ll come too, then.",
      "No, why should you?",
      "said Kitty, opening her eyes wide, and clutching at Varenka s parasol, so as not to let her go.",
      "No, wait a minute; why not?",
      "Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward at your helping.",
      "No, tell me why you don t want me to be often at the Petrovs .",
      "You don t want me to why not?",
      "I didn t say that, said Varenka quietly.",
      "No, please tell me!",
      "Tell you everything?",
      "Everything, everything!",
      "Kitty assented.",
      "Well, there s really nothing of any consequence; only that Mihail Alexeyevitch (that was the artist s name) had meant to leave earlier, and now he doesn t want to go away, said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Well, well!",
      "Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at Varenka.",
      "Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn t want to go because you are here.",
      "Of course, that was nonsense; but there was a dispute over it over you.",
      "You know how irritable these sick people are.",
      "Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on speaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm coming she did not know whether of tears or of words.",
      "So you d better not go.... You understand; you won t be offended?...",
      "And it serves me right!",
      "Kitty cried quickly, snatching the parasol out of Varenka s hand, and looking past her friend s face.",
      "Varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she was afraid of wounding her.",
      "How does it serve you right?",
      "I don t understand, she said.",
      "It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all done on purpose, and not from the heart.",
      "What business had I to interfere with outsiders?",
      "And so it s come about that I m a cause of quarrel, and that I ve done what nobody asked me to do.",
      "Because it was all a sham!",
      "a sham!",
      "a sham!...",
      "with what object?",
      "said Varenka gently.",
      "Oh, it s so idiotic!",
      "so hateful!",
      "There was no need whatever for me....",
      "Nothing but sham!",
      "she said, opening and shutting the parasol.",
      "But with what object?",
      "To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone.",
      "now I won t descend to that.",
      "I ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a cheat.",
      "But who is a cheat?",
      "said Varenka reproachfully.",
      "You speak as if....",
      "But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her finish.",
      "I don t talk about you, not about you at all.",
      "You re perfection.",
      "Yes, yes, I know you re all perfection; but what am I to do if I m bad?",
      "This would never have been if I weren t bad.",
      "So let me be what I am.",
      "I won t be a sham.",
      "What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna?",
      "Let them go their way, and me go mine.",
      "I can t be different.... And yet it s not that, it s not that.",
      "What is not that?",
      "asked Varenka in bewilderment.",
      "Everything.",
      "I can t act except from the heart, and you act from principle.",
      "I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save me, to improve me.",
      "You are unjust, said Varenka.",
      "But I m not speaking of other people, I m speaking of myself.",
      "Kitty, they heard her mother s voice, come here, show papa your necklace.",
      "Kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took the necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.",
      "Why are you so red?",
      "her mother and father said to her with one voice.",
      "Nothing, she answered.",
      "I ll be back directly, and she ran back.",
      "She s still here, she thought.",
      "What am I to say to her?",
      "what have I done, what have I said?",
      "Why was I rude to her?",
      "thought Kitty, and she stopped in the doorway.",
      "Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the table examining the spring which Kitty had broken.",
      "She lifted her head.",
      "Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me, whispered Kitty, going up to her.",
      "I don t remember what I said.",
      "I....",
      "I really didn t mean to hurt you, said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Peace was made.",
      "But with her father s coming all the world in which she had been living was transformed for Kitty.",
      "She did not give up everything she had learned, but she became aware that she had deceived herself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be.",
      "Her eyes were, it seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself without hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had wished to mount.",
      "Moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of the world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been living.",
      "The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable, and she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to Russia, to Ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly had already gone with her children.",
      "But her affection for Varenka did not wane.",
      "As she said good-bye, Kitty begged her to come to them in Russia.",
      "I ll come when you get married, said Varenka.",
      "I shall never marry.",
      "Well, then, I shall never come.",
      "Well, then, I shall be married simply for that.",
      "Mind now, remember your promise, said Kitty.",
      "The doctor s prediction was fulfilled.",
      "Kitty returned home to Russia cured.",
      "She was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was serene.",
      "Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her.",
      "PART THREE Chapter 1 Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead of going abroad as he usually did, he came towards the end of May to stay in the country with his brother.",
      "In his judgment the best sort of life was a country life.",
      "He had come now to enjoy such a life at his brother s. Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him, especially as he did not expect his brother Nikolay that summer.",
      "But in spite of his affection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch, Konstantin Levin was uncomfortable with his brother in the country.",
      "It made him uncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him to see his brother s attitude to the country.",
      "To Konstantin Levin the country was the background of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor.",
      "To Sergey Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its utility.",
      "To Konstantin Levin the country was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt.",
      "To Sergey Ivanovitch the country was particularly good, because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing.",
      "Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch s attitude to the peasants rather piqued Konstantin.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he knew and liked the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants, which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them.",
      "Konstantin Levin did not like such an attitude to the peasants.",
      "To Konstantin the peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in spite of all the respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he had for the peasant sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the milk of his peasant nurse still as a fellow-worker with him, while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these men, he was very often, when their common labors called for other qualities, exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of method, drunkenness, and lying.",
      "If he had been asked whether he liked or didn t like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply.",
      "He liked and did not like the peasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general.",
      "Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants.",
      "But like or dislike the people as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with the people, and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of the people, did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and the people, and could not contrast himself with them.",
      "Moreover, although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and what was more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him, and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice), he had no definite views of the people, and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew the people as the question whether he liked them.",
      "For him to say he knew the peasantry would have been the same as to say he knew men.",
      "He was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them peasants, whom he regarded as good and interesting people, and he was continually observing new points in them, altering his former views of them and forming new ones.",
      "With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the contrary.",
      "Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men generally.",
      "In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself, but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life.",
      "He never changed his opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them.",
      "In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the peasantry, Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his brother, precisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the peasant his character, his qualities, and his tastes.",
      "Konstantin Levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject, and so in their arguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself.",
      "In Sergey Ivanovitch s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow, _with his heart in the right place_ (as he expressed it in French), but with a mind which, though fairly quick, was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment, and consequently filled with contradictions.",
      "With all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things, but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily.",
      "Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good.",
      "But in the depths of his heart, the older he became, and the more intimately he knew his brother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good, of which he felt himself utterly devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a lack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life, and to care only for that one.",
      "The better he knew his brother, the more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for the public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently took interest in them.",
      "Levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a new machine.",
      "Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother, because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work on the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.",
      "But though he was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he was doing no writing, he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him, and liked to have someone to listen to him.",
      "His most usual and natural listener was his brother.",
      "And so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations, Konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun, and to lie so, basking and chatting lazily.",
      "You wouldn t believe, he would say to his brother, what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me.",
      "Not an idea in one s brain, as empty as a drum!",
      "But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him, especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention, and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.",
      "Come, you ve done enough trudging about in the heat, Sergey Ivanovitch would say to him.",
      "No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a minute, Levin would answer, and he would run off to the fields.",
      "Chapter 2 Early in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna, the old nurse and housekeeper, in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just pickled, slipped, fell, and sprained her wrist.",
      "The district doctor, a talkative young medical student, who had just finished his studies, came to see her.",
      "He examined the wrist, said it was not broken, was delighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev, and to show his advanced views of things told him all the scandal of the district, complaining of the poor state into which the district council had fallen.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively, asked him questions, and, roused by a new listener, he talked fluently, uttered a few keen and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated by the young doctor, and was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well, which always, with him, followed a brilliant and eager conversation.",
      "After the departure of the doctor, he wanted to go with a fishing rod to the river.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling, and was, it seemed, proud of being able to care for such a stupid occupation.",
      "Konstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plough land and meadows, had come to take his brother in the trap.",
      "It was that time of the year, the turning-point of summer, when the crops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins to think of the sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; when the rye is all in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves in gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats, with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over the late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground; when the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the cattle, are half ploughed over, with paths left untouched by the plough; when from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes at sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the low-lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing, with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it.",
      "It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest every year recurring, every year straining every nerve of the peasants.",
      "The crop was a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in with short, dewy nights.",
      "The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods, which were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and brightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this year s saplings brilliant with emerald.",
      "Konstantin Levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature.",
      "Words for him took away the beauty of what he saw.",
      "He assented to what his brother said, but he could not help beginning to think of other things.",
      "When they came out of the woods, all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and checkered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in parts even ploughed.",
      "A string of carts was moving across it.",
      "Levin counted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing.",
      "He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the hay-making.",
      "On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.",
      "The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass, and that he might not get his feet wet, Sergey Ivanovitch asked his brother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the carp was caught.",
      "Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing grass, he drove him into the meadow.",
      "The high grass softly turned about the wheels and the horse s legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels.",
      "His brother seated himself under a bush, arranging his tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened him up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by the wind.",
      "The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the dampest spots.",
      "Crossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out onto the road, and met an old man with a swollen eye, carrying a skep on his shoulder.",
      "taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?",
      "No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich!",
      "All we can do to keep our own!",
      "This is the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught them.",
      "They were ploughing your field.",
      "They unyoked the horses and galloped after them.",
      "Well, what do you say, Fomitch start mowing or wait a bit?",
      "Eh, well.",
      "Our way s to wait till St. Peter s Day.",
      "But you always mow sooner.",
      "Well, to be sure, please God, the hay s good.",
      "There ll be plenty for the beasts.",
      "What do you think about the weather?",
      "That s in God s hands.",
      "Maybe it will be fine.",
      "Levin went up to his brother.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing, but he was not bored, and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind.",
      "Levin saw that, stimulated by his conversation with the doctor, he wanted to talk.",
      "Levin, on the other hand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day, and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing, which greatly absorbed him.",
      "Well, let s be going, he said.",
      "Why be in such a hurry?",
      "Let s stay a little.",
      "But how wet you are!",
      "Even though one catches nothing, it s nice.",
      "That s the best thing about every part of sport, that one has to do with nature.",
      "How exquisite this steely water is!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "These riverside banks always remind me of the riddle do you know it?",
      "The grass says to the water: we quiver and we quiver.",
      "I don t know the riddle, answered Levin wearily.",
      "Chapter 3 Do you know, I ve been thinking about you, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "It s beyond everything what s being done in the district, according to what this doctor tells me.",
      "He s a very intelligent fellow.",
      "And as I ve told you before, I tell you again: it s not right for you not to go to the meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business.",
      "If decent people won t go into it, of course it s bound to go all wrong.",
      "We pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no schools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor drugstores nothing.",
      "Well, I did try, you know, Levin said slowly and unwillingly.",
      "I can t!",
      "and so there s no help for it.",
      "But why can t you?",
      "I must own I can t make it out.",
      "Indifference, incapacity I won t admit; surely it s not simply laziness?",
      "None of those things.",
      "I ve tried, and I see I can do nothing, said Levin.",
      "He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying.",
      "Looking towards the plough land across the river, he made out something black, but he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.",
      "Why is it you can do nothing?",
      "You made an attempt and didn t succeed, as you think, and you give in.",
      "How can you have so little self-respect?",
      "Self-respect!",
      "said Levin, stung to the quick by his brother s words; I don t understand.",
      "If they d told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus, and I didn t, then pride would have come in.",
      "But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that all this business is of great importance.",
      "do you mean to say it s not of importance?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, stung to the quick too at his brother s considering anything of no importance that interested him, and still more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying.",
      "I don t think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can t help it, answered Levin, making out that what he saw was the bailiff, and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed land.",
      "They were turning the plough over.",
      "Can they have finished ploughing?",
      "Come, really though, said the elder brother, with a frown on his handsome, clever face, there s a limit to everything.",
      "It s very well to be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional I know all about that; but really, what you re saying either has no meaning, or it has a very wrong meaning.",
      "How can you think it a matter of no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert....",
      "I never did assert it, thought Konstantin Levin.",
      "...dies without help?",
      "The ignorant peasant-women starve the children, and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping them, and don t help them because to your mind it s of no importance.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so undeveloped that you can t see all that you can do, or you won t sacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do it.",
      "Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to submit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good.",
      "And this mortified him and hurt his feelings.",
      "It s both, he said resolutely: I don t see that it was possible.... What!",
      "was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to provide medical aid?",
      "Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square miles of our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in the fields, I don t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over.",
      "And besides, I don t believe in medicine.",
      "Oh, well, that s unfair ...",
      "I can quote to you thousands of instances....",
      "But the schools, anyway.",
      "Why have schools?",
      "What do you mean?",
      "Can there be two opinions of the advantage of education?",
      "If it s a good thing for you, it s a good thing for everyone.",
      "Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, and so he got hot, and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business.",
      "Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools to which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants don t want to send their children, and to which I ve no very firm faith that they ought to send them?",
      "said he.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack.",
      "He was silent for a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his brother smiling.",
      "Come, now....",
      "In the first place, the dispensary is needed.",
      "We ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.",
      "That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you.",
      "No, you can ask anyone you like, Konstantin Levin answered with decision, the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman.",
      "And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as they put up bridges they re stolen.",
      "Still, that s not the point, said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.",
      "He disliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected points, so that there was no knowing to which to reply.",
      "Do you admit that education is a benefit for the people?",
      "Yes, I admit it, said Levin without thinking, and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think.",
      "He felt that if he admitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish.",
      "How it would be proved he could not tell, but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him, and he awaited the proofs.",
      "The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.",
      "If you admit that it is a benefit, said Sergey Ivanovitch, then, as an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement, and so wishing to work for it.",
      "But I still do not admit this movement to be just, said Konstantin Levin, reddening a little.",
      "But you said just now.... That s to say, I don t admit it s being either good or possible.",
      "That you can t tell without making the trial.",
      "Well, supposing that s so, said Levin, though he did not suppose so at all, supposing that is so, still I don t see, all the same, what I m to worry myself about it for.",
      "No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical point of view, said Levin.",
      "I can t see where philosophy comes in, said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a tone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother s right to talk about philosophy.",
      "And that irritated Levin.",
      "I ll tell you, then, he said with heat, I imagine the mainspring of all our actions is, after all, self-interest.",
      "Now in the local institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my horses carry me well enough over bad ones.",
      "Doctors and dispensaries are no use to me.",
      "An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me.",
      "I never appeal to him, and never shall appeal to him.",
      "The schools are no good to me, but positively harmful, as I told you.",
      "For me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no inducement.",
      "Excuse me, Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile, self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did work for it.",
      "Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter.",
      "There self-interest did come in.",
      "One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all decent people among us.",
      "But to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which I don t live to serve on a jury and try a peasant who s stolen a flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, Do you admit, prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?",
      "Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all to the point.",
      "But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.",
      "Well, what do you mean to say, then?",
      "I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest, I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made raids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and freedom.",
      "I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka I don t understand, and I can t do it.",
      "Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.",
      "But tomorrow it ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?",
      "I m not going to be tried.",
      "I shan t murder anybody, and I ve no need of it.",
      "Well, I tell you what, he went on, flying off again to a subject quite beside the point, our district self-government and all the rest of it it s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe, and I can t gush over these birch branches and believe in them.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that point, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.",
      "Excuse me, but you know one really can t argue in that way, he observed.",
      "But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of which he was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he went on.",
      "I imagine, he said, that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self-interest, that s a universal principle, a philosophical principle, he said, repeating the word philosophical with determination, as though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy.",
      "He too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies, he thought.",
      "Come, you d better let philosophy alone, he said.",
      "The chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests.",
      "But that s not to the point; what is to the point is a correction I must make in your comparison.",
      "The birches are not simply stuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one must deal carefully with them.",
      "It s only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of what s of importance and significance in their institutions, and know how to value them, that have a future before them it s only those peoples that one can truly call historical.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him, and showed him all the incorrectness of his view.",
      "As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that s simply our Russian sloth and old serf-owner s ways, and I m convinced that in you it s a temporary error and will pass.",
      "Konstantin was silent.",
      "He felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother.",
      "Only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly, or because his brother would not or could not understand him.",
      "But he did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they drove off.",
      "Chapter 4 The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with his brother was this.",
      "Once in a previous year he had gone to look at the mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper, he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing.",
      "He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since.",
      "He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house, and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants.",
      "Ever since his brother s arrival, he had been in doubt whether to mow or not.",
      "He was loath to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it.",
      "But as he drove into the meadow, and recalled the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he would go mowing.",
      "After the irritating discussion with his brother, he pondered over this intention again.",
      "I must have physical exercise, or my temper ll certainly be ruined, he thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants.",
      "Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house, gave directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the largest and best of his grass lands.",
      "And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring it round tomorrow.",
      "I shall maybe do some mowing myself too, he said, trying not to be embarrassed.",
      "The bailiff smiled and said: Yes, sir.",
      "At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother: I fancy the fine weather will last.",
      "Tomorrow I shall start mowing.",
      "I m so fond of that form of field labor, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I m awfully fond of it.",
      "I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his brother.",
      "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
      "Yes, it s very pleasant, said Levin.",
      "It s splendid as exercise, only you ll hardly be able to stand it, said Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.",
      "I ve tried it.",
      "It s hard work at first, but you get into it.",
      "I dare say I shall manage to keep it up.... Really!",
      "what an idea!",
      "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
      "I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master s being such a queer fish?",
      "No, I don t think so; but it s so delightful, and at the same time such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.",
      "But how will you do about dining with them?",
      "To send you a bottle of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.",
      "No, I ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.",
      "Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he was detained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row.",
      "From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting.",
      "Gradually, as he rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight, some in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a long string, swinging their scythes differently.",
      "He counted forty-two of them.",
      "They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow, where there had been an old dam.",
      "Levin recognized some of his own men.",
      "Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of Levin s, taking every row with a wide sweep.",
      "Here, too, was Tit, Levin s preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant.",
      "He was in front of all, and cut his wide row without bending, as though playing with the scythe.",
      "Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him.",
      "It s ready, sir; it s like a razor, cuts of itself, said Tit, taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.",
      "Levin took the scythe, and began trying it.",
      "As they finished their rows, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one after another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master.",
      "They all stared at him, but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a wrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out into the road and accosted him.",
      "Look ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there s no letting it go!",
      "he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.",
      "I ll try not to let it go, he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and waiting for the time to begin.",
      "Mind ee, repeated the old man.",
      "Tit made room, and Levin started behind him.",
      "The grass was short close to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while, and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the first moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously.",
      "Behind him he heard voices: It s not set right; handle s too high; see how he has to stoop to it, said one.",
      "Press more on the heel, said another.",
      "Never mind, he ll get on all right, the old man resumed.",
      "He s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you ll tire yourself out....",
      "The master, sure, does his best for himself!",
      "But see the grass missed out!",
      "For such work us fellows would catch it!",
      "The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering, followed Tit, trying to do the best he could.",
      "They moved a hundred paces.",
      "Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest weariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up: he was so tired.",
      "He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop.",
      "But at that very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it.",
      "Levin straightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round.",
      "Behind him came a peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe.",
      "Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin s, and they went on.",
      "The next time it was just the same.",
      "Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe, not stopping nor showing signs of weariness.",
      "Levin followed him, trying not to get left behind, and he found it harder and harder: the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.",
      "So they mowed the first row.",
      "And this long row seemed particularly hard work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water, he felt very happy.",
      "What delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.",
      "His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut.",
      "I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body, he thought, comparing Tit s row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line, with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.",
      "The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly, probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to be a long one.",
      "The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.",
      "He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind the peasants, and to do his work as well as possible.",
      "He heard nothing but the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit s upright figure mowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe, and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.",
      "Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was or whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot, moist shoulders.",
      "He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes.",
      "A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops were falling.",
      "Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on; others just like Levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders, enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.",
      "Another row, and yet another row, followed long rows and short rows, with good grass and with poor grass.",
      "Levin lost all sense of time, and could not have told whether it was late or early now.",
      "A change began to come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction.",
      "In the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing, and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit s. But so soon as he recollected what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly mown.",
      "On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him.",
      "They both looked at the sun.",
      "What are they talking about, and why doesn t he go back?",
      "thought Levin, not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping, and it was time for their lunch.",
      "Lunch, sir, said the old man.",
      "Is it really time?",
      "That s right; lunch, then.",
      "Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.",
      "Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his hay.",
      "The hay will be spoiled, he said.",
      "Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you ll rake in fine weather!",
      "said the old man.",
      "Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was only just getting up.",
      "When he had drunk his coffee, Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining-room.",
      "Chapter 5 After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before, but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely, and now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had only been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the first time.",
      "The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet turned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one s arms in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the high, even row of grass.",
      "It was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.",
      "Behind Levin came the lad Mishka.",
      "His pretty, boyish face, with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled.",
      "He would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him.",
      "Levin kept between them.",
      "In the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him.",
      "The perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his arms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor; and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when it was possible not to think what one was doing.",
      "The scythe cut of itself.",
      "These were happy moments.",
      "Still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and offered Levin a drink.",
      "What do you say to my home-brew, eh?",
      "Good, eh?",
      "said he, winking.",
      "And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper.",
      "And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter, with his hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country.",
      "The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe, but the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work turned out regular and well-finished of itself.",
      "These were the most blissful moments.",
      "It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel.",
      "The old man did this easily.",
      "When a hillock came he changed his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with the tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes.",
      "And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe, then he looked at a quail s nest, from which the bird flew just under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it away.",
      "For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of position were difficult.",
      "Both of them, repeating over and over again the same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them.",
      "Levin did not notice how time was passing.",
      "If he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour and it was getting on for dinner time.",
      "As they were walking back over the cut grass, the old man called Levin s attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through the long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.",
      "Look ee, the little emmets crawling!",
      "he said, pointing to them, and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun.",
      "They mowed two more rows; the old man stopped.",
      "Come, master, dinner time!",
      "he said briskly.",
      "And on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them.",
      "The peasants gathered into groups those further away under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.",
      "Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.",
      "All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago.",
      "The peasants got ready for dinner.",
      "Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream, others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of bread, and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer.",
      "The old man crumbled up some bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured water on it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having seasoned it with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.",
      "Come, master, taste my sop, said he, kneeling down before the cup.",
      "The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home.",
      "He dined with the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking the keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man.",
      "He felt much nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man.",
      "When the old man got up again, said his prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his head for a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled his hot face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him.",
      "The old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads.",
      "Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was so changed.",
      "The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already sweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun.",
      "And the bushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not visible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving, ascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow all was perfectly new.",
      "Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day.",
      "The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men.",
      "They had cut the whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor, taken thirty scythes two days to mow.",
      "Only the corners remained to do, where the rows were short.",
      "But Levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky.",
      "He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much done as possible.",
      "Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?",
      "what do you think?",
      "he said to the old man.",
      "As God wills, the sun s not high.",
      "A little vodka for the lads?",
      "At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who smoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that Mashkin Upland s to be cut there ll be some vodka.",
      "Why not cut it?",
      "Come on, Tit!",
      "We ll look sharp!",
      "We can eat at night.",
      "Come on!",
      "cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back to work.",
      "Come, lads, keep it up!",
      "said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.",
      "Get along, get along!",
      "said the old man, hurrying after him and easily overtaking him, I ll mow you down, look out!",
      "And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one another.",
      "But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass, and the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly.",
      "The little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes.",
      "The last of the mowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin Upland.",
      "The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their jingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland.",
      "The grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and feathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild heart s-ease.",
      "After a brief consultation whether to take the rows lengthwise or diagonally Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired peasant, went on ahead.",
      "He went up to the top, turned back again and started mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind him, going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest.",
      "The sun sank behind the forest.",
      "The dew was falling by now; the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a mist was rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh, dewy shade.",
      "The work went rapidly.",
      "The grass cut with a juicy sound, and was at once laid in high, fragrant rows.",
      "The mowers from all sides, brought closer together in the short row, kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.",
      "Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man.",
      "The old man, who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as good-humored, jocose, and free in his movements.",
      "Among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the so-called birch mushrooms, swollen fat in the succulent grass.",
      "But the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in his bosom.",
      "Another present for my old woman, he said as he did so.",
      "Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine.",
      "But this did not trouble the old man.",
      "Swinging his scythe just as ever, and moving his feet in their big, plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he climbed slowly up the steep place, and though his breeches hanging out below his smock, and his whole frame trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the peasants and Levin.",
      "Levin walked after him and often thought he must fall, as he climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have been hard work to clamber without anything.",
      "But he climbed up and did what he had to do.",
      "He felt as though some external force were moving him.",
      "Chapter 6 Mashkin Upland was mown, the last row finished, the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home.",
      "Levin got on his horse and, parting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards.",
      "On the hillside he looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley; he could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter, and the sound of clanking scythes.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking iced lemon and water in his own room, looking through the reviews and papers which he had only just received by post, when Levin rushed into the room, talking merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead, and his back and chest grimed and moist.",
      "We mowed the whole meadow!",
      "Oh, it is nice, delicious!",
      "And how have you been getting on?",
      "said Levin, completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day.",
      "what do you look like!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction.",
      "And the door, do shut the door!",
      "You must have let in a dozen at least.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his own room he never opened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.",
      "Not one, on my honor.",
      "But if I have, I ll catch them.",
      "You wouldn t believe what a pleasure it is!",
      "How have you spent the day?",
      "Very well.",
      "But have you really been mowing the whole day?",
      "I expect you re as hungry as a wolf.",
      "Kouzma has got everything ready for you.",
      "No, I don t feel hungry even.",
      "I had something to eat there.",
      "But I ll go and wash.",
      "Yes, go along, go along, and I ll come to you directly, said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head as he looked at his brother.",
      "Go along, make haste, he added smiling, and gathering up his books, he prepared to go too.",
      "He, too, felt suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave his brother s side.",
      "But what did you do while it was raining?",
      "Rain?",
      "Why, there was scarcely a drop.",
      "I ll come directly.",
      "So you had a nice day too?",
      "That s first-rate.",
      "And Levin went off to change his clothes.",
      "Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining-room.",
      "Although it seemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt Kouzma s feelings, yet when he began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch watched him with a smile.",
      "Oh, by the way, there s a letter for you, said he.",
      "Kouzma, bring it down, please.",
      "And mind you shut the doors.",
      "The letter was from Oblonsky.",
      "Levin read it aloud.",
      "Oblonsky wrote to him from Petersburg: I have had a letter from Dolly; she s at Ergushovo, and everything seems going wrong there.",
      "Do ride over and see her, please; help her with advice; you know all about it.",
      "She will be so glad to see you.",
      "She s quite alone, poor thing.",
      "My mother-in-law and all of them are still abroad.",
      "That s capital!",
      "I will certainly ride over to her, said Levin.",
      "Or we ll go together.",
      "She s such a splendid woman, isn t she?",
      "They re not far from here, then?",
      "Twenty-five miles.",
      "Or perhaps it is thirty.",
      "But a capital road.",
      "Capital, we ll drive over.",
      "I shall be delighted, said Sergey Ivanovitch, still smiling.",
      "The sight of his younger brother s appearance had immediately put him in a good humor.",
      "Well, you have an appetite!",
      "he said, looking at his dark-red, sunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.",
      "You can t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every sort of foolishness.",
      "I want to enrich medicine with a new word: _Arbeitskur_.",
      "Well, but you don t need it, I should fancy.",
      "No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.",
      "Yes, it ought to be tried.",
      "I had meant to come to the mowing to look at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the forest.",
      "I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village, met your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants view of you.",
      "As far as I can make out, they don t approve of this.",
      "She said: It s not a gentleman s work.",
      "Altogether, I fancy that in the people s ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it, gentlemanly lines of action.",
      "And they don t sanction the gentry s moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.",
      "Maybe so; but anyway it s a pleasure such as I have never known in my life.",
      "And there s no harm in it, you know.",
      "Is there?",
      "answered Levin.",
      "I can t help it if they don t like it.",
      "Though I do believe it s all right.",
      "Altogether, pursued Sergey Ivanovitch, you re satisfied with your day?",
      "Quite satisfied.",
      "We cut the whole meadow.",
      "And such a splendid old man I made friends with there!",
      "You can t fancy how delightful he was!",
      "Well, so you re content with your day.",
      "And so am I.",
      "First, I solved two chess problems, and one a very pretty one a pawn opening.",
      "I ll show it you.",
      "And then I thought over our conversation yesterday.",
      "Eh!",
      "our conversation yesterday?",
      "said Levin, blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner, and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was about.",
      "I think you are partly right.",
      "Our difference of opinion amounts to this, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement.",
      "Possibly you are right too, that action founded on material interest would be more desirable.",
      "You are altogether, as the French say, too _primesauti re_ a nature; you must have intense, energetic action, or nothing.",
      "Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word, and did not want to understand.",
      "He was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard.",
      "So that s what I think it is, my dear boy, said Sergey Ivanovitch, touching him on the shoulder.",
      "Yes, of course.",
      "But, do you know?",
      "I won t stand up for my view, answered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile.",
      "Whatever was it I was disputing about?",
      "Of course, I m right, and he s right, and it s all first-rate.",
      "Only I must go round to the counting house and see to things.",
      "He got up, stretching and smiling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled too.",
      "If you want to go out, let s go together, he said, disinclined to be parted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy.",
      "Come, we ll go to the counting house, if you have to go there.",
      "Oh, heavens!",
      "shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergey Ivanovitch was quite frightened.",
      "What, what is the matter?",
      "How s Agafea Mihalovna s hand?",
      "said Levin, slapping himself on the head.",
      "I d positively forgotten her even.",
      "It s much better.",
      "Well, anyway I ll run down to her.",
      "Before you ve time to get your hat on, I ll be back.",
      "And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring-rattle.",
      "Chapter 7 Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural and essential official duty so familiar to everyone in the government service, though incomprehensible to outsiders that duty, but for which one could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of his existence and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken all the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer villas.",
      "Meanwhile Dolly and the children had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as possible.",
      "She had gone to Ergushovo, the estate that had been her dowry, and the one where in spring the forest had been sold.",
      "It was nearly forty miles from Levin s Pokrovskoe.",
      "The big, old house at Ergushovo had been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the lodge done up and built on to.",
      "Twenty years before, when Dolly was a child, the lodge had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all lodges, it stood sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south.",
      "But by now this lodge was old and dilapidated.",
      "When Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down in the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to look over the house and order what repairs might be needed.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, like all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous for his wife s comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and given instructions about everything that he considered necessary.",
      "What he considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne, to put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the pond, and to plant flowers.",
      "But he forgot many other essential matters, the want of which greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on.",
      "In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch s efforts to be an attentive father and husband, he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and children.",
      "He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them that he shaped his life.",
      "On his return to Moscow he informed his wife with pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little paradise, and that he advised her most certainly to go.",
      "His wife s staying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased expenses, and it left him more at liberty.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children, especially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her strength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the fishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable.",
      "Besides this, she was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of getting her sister Kitty to stay with her there.",
      "Kitty was to be back from abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been prescribed for her.",
      "Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations for both of them.",
      "The first days of her existence in the country were very hard for Dolly.",
      "She used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression she had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the unpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not luxurious Dolly could easily make up her mind to that was cheap and comfortable; that there was plenty of everything, everything was cheap, everything could be got, and children were happy.",
      "But now coming to the country as the head of a family, she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied.",
      "The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain, and in the night the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery, so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing-room.",
      "There was no kitchen maid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared from the words of the cowherd-woman that some were about to calve, others had just calved, others were old, and others again hard-uddered; there was not butter nor milk enough even for the children.",
      "There were no eggs.",
      "They could get no fowls; old, purplish, stringy cocks were all they had for roasting and boiling.",
      "Impossible to get women to scrub the floors all were potato-hoeing.",
      "Driving was out of the question, because one of the horses was restive, and bolted in the shafts.",
      "There was no place where they could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the cattle and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle strayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one terrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore somebody.",
      "There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; what cupboards there were either would not close at all, or burst open whenever anyone passed by them.",
      "There were no pots and pans; there was no copper in the washhouse, nor even an ironing-board in the maids room.",
      "Finding instead of peace and rest all these, from her point of view, fearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair.",
      "She exerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness of the position, and was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes.",
      "The bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had taken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome and respectful appearance as a hall-porter, showed no sympathy for Darya Alexandrovna s woes.",
      "He said respectfully, nothing can be done, the peasants are such a wretched lot, and did nothing to help her.",
      "The position seemed hopeless.",
      "But in the Oblonskys household, as in all families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and useful person, Marya Philimonovna.",
      "She soothed her mistress, assured her that everything would _come round_ (it was her expression, and Matvey had borrowed it from her), and without fuss or hurry proceeded to set to work herself.",
      "She had immediately made friends with the bailiff s wife, and on the very first day she drank tea with her and the bailiff under the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of the position.",
      "Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club, so to say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting of the bailiff s wife, the village elder, and the counting-house clerk, that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away, and in a week s time everything actually had come round.",
      "The roof was mended, a kitchen maid was found a crony of the village elder s hens were bought, the cows began giving milk, the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes, the carpenter made a mangle, hooks were put in the cupboards, and they ceased to burst open spontaneously, and an ironing-board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers, and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids room.",
      "Just see, now, and you were quite in despair, said Marya Philimonovna, pointing to the ironing-board.",
      "They even rigged up a bathing-shed of straw hurdles.",
      "Lily began to bathe, and Darya Alexandrovna began to realize, if only in part, her expectations, if not of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, life in the country.",
      "Peaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be.",
      "One would fall ill, another might easily become so, a third would be without something necessary, a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition, and so on.",
      "Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace.",
      "But these cares and anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible.",
      "Had it not been for them, she would have been left alone to brood over her husband who did not love her.",
      "And besides, hard though it was for the mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and the grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings.",
      "Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed, like gold in sand, and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain, nothing but sand; but there were good moments too when she saw nothing but the joy, nothing but gold.",
      "Now in the solitude of the country, she began to be more and more frequently aware of those joys.",
      "Often, looking at them, she would make every possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken, that she as a mother was partial to her children.",
      "All the same, she could not help saying to herself that she had charming children, all six of them in different ways, but a set of children such as is not often to be met with, and she was happy in them, and proud of them.",
      "Chapter 8 Towards the end of May, when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged, she received her husband s answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country.",
      "He wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before, and promised to come down at the first chance.",
      "This chance did not present itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna stayed alone in the country.",
      "On the Sunday in St. Peter s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for all her children to take the sacrament.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna in her intimate, philosophical talks with her sister, her mother, and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion.",
      "She had a strange religion of transmigration of souls all her own, in which she had firm faith, troubling herself little about the dogmas of the Church.",
      "But in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the Church and not merely in order to set an example, but with all her heart in it.",
      "The fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely, and with the full approval and sympathy of Marya Philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer.",
      "For several days before, Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children.",
      "Frocks were made or altered and washed, seams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn on, and ribbons got ready.",
      "One dress, Tanya s, which the English governess had undertaken, cost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper.",
      "The English governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place, had taken up the sleeves too much, and altogether spoilt the dress.",
      "It was so narrow on Tanya s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her.",
      "But Marya Philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a little shoulder-cape.",
      "The dress was set right, but there was nearly a quarrel with the English governess.",
      "On the morning, however, all was happily arranged, and towards ten o clock the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their new dresses, with beaming faces, stood on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother.",
      "To the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed, thanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff s horse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her own attire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair, and dressed with care and excitement.",
      "In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired.",
      "Later on, as she got older, dress became more and more distasteful to her.",
      "She saw that she was losing her good looks.",
      "But now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again.",
      "Now she did not dress for her own sake, not for the sake of her own beauty, but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect.",
      "And looking at herself for the last time in the looking-glass she was satisfied with herself.",
      "She looked nice.",
      "Not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a ball, but nice for the object which she now had in view.",
      "In the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants and their women-folk.",
      "But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she saw, the sensation produced by her children and her.",
      "The children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, but they were charming in the way they behaved.",
      "Aliosha, it is true, did not stand quite correctly; he kept turning round, trying to look at his little jacket from behind; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet.",
      "Tanya behaved like a grown-up person, and looked after the little ones.",
      "And the smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her na ve astonishment at everything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the sacrament, she said in English, Please, some more.",
      "On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened, and were very sedate.",
      "Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began whistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English governess, and was forbidden to have any tart.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna would not have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but she had to support the English governess s authority, and she upheld her decision that Grisha should have no tart.",
      "This rather spoiled the general good humor.",
      "Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled too, and he was not punished, and that he wasn t crying for the tart he didn t care but at being unjustly treated.",
      "This was really too tragic, and Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English governess to forgive Grisha, and she went to speak to her.",
      "But on the way, as she passed the drawing-room, she beheld a scene, filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes, and she forgave the delinquent herself.",
      "The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing-room; beside him was standing Tanya with a plate.",
      "On the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls, she had asked the governess s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery, and had taken it instead to her brother.",
      "While still weeping over the injustice of his punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept saying through his sobs, Eat yourself; let s eat it together ... together.",
      "Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha, then of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing in her eyes too; but she did not refuse, and ate her share.",
      "On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking into her face, they saw they were not doing wrong.",
      "They burst out laughing, and, with their mouths full of tart, they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands, and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam.",
      "Your new white frock!",
      "Tanya!",
      "Grisha!",
      "said their mother, trying to save the frock, but with tears in her eyes, smiling a blissful, rapturous smile.",
      "The new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their old jackets, and the wagonette to be harnessed; with Brownie, to the bailiff s annoyance, again in the shafts, to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing.",
      "A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery, and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.",
      "They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch mushroom.",
      "It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and pointed them out to her; but this time she found a big one quite of herself, and there was a general scream of delight, Lily has found a mushroom!",
      "Then they reached the river, put the horses under the birch trees, and went to the bathing-place.",
      "The coachman, Terenty, fastened the horses, who kept whisking away the flies, to a tree, and, treading down the grass, lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag, while the never-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing-place.",
      "Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their wild pranks, though it was difficult too to keep in one s head and not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for the different legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing herself, and believed it to be very good for the children, enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children.",
      "To go over all those fat little legs, pulling on their stockings, to take in her arms and dip those little naked bodies, and to hear their screams of delight and alarm, to see the breathless faces with wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs, was a great pleasure to her.",
      "When half the children had been dressed, some peasant women in holiday dress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped shyly.",
      "Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them, and Darya Alexandrovna began to talk to the women.",
      "At first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her questions, but soon they grew bolder and began to talk, winning Darya Alexandrovna s heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed.",
      "My, what a beauty!",
      "as white as sugar, said one, admiring Tanitchka, and shaking her head; but thin....",
      "Yes, she has been ill. And so they ve been bathing you too, said another to the baby.",
      "No; he s only three months old, answered Darya Alexandrovna with pride.",
      "And have you any children?",
      "I ve had four; I ve two living a boy and a girl.",
      "I weaned her last carnival.",
      "How old is she?",
      "Why, two years old.",
      "Why did you nurse her so long?",
      "It s our custom; for three fasts.... And the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "What sort of time did she have?",
      "What was the matter with the boy?",
      "Where was her husband?",
      "Did it often happen?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, so interesting to her was their conversation, so completely identical were all their interests.",
      "What pleased her most of all was that she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so many children, and such fine ones.",
      "The peasant women even made Darya Alexandrovna laugh, and offended the English governess, because she was the cause of the laughter she did not understand.",
      "One of the younger women kept staring at the Englishwoman, who was dressing after all the rest, and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from the remark, My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and she ll never have done!",
      "she said, and they all went off into roars.",
      "Chapter 9 On the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her children round her, their heads still wet from their bath, and a kerchief tied over her own head, was getting near the house, the coachman said, There s some gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, I do believe.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin walking to meet them.",
      "She was glad to see him at any time, but at this moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory.",
      "No one was better able to appreciate her grandeur than Levin.",
      "Seeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his daydream of family life.",
      "You re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "she said, holding out her hand to him.",
      "Glad to see me, but you didn t let me know.",
      "My brother s staying with me.",
      "I got a note from Stiva that you were here.",
      "From Stiva?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.",
      "Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you, said Levin, and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence by the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them.",
      "He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch s of foisting his domestic duties on others.",
      "And she was at once aware that Levin was aware of this.",
      "It was just for this fineness of perception, for this delicacy, that Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.",
      "I know, of course, said Levin, that that simply means that you would like to see me, and I m exceedingly glad.",
      "Though I can fancy that, used to town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and if there s anything wanted, I m altogether at your disposal.",
      "At first things were rather uncomfortable, but now we ve settled everything capitally thanks to my old nurse, she said, indicating Marya Philimonovna, who, seeing that they were speaking of her, smiled brightly and cordially to Levin.",
      "She knew him, and knew that he would be a good match for her young lady, and was very keen to see the matter settled.",
      "Won t you get in, sir, we ll make room this side!",
      "No, I ll walk.",
      "Children, who d like to race the horses with me?",
      "The children knew Levin very little, and could not remember when they had seen him, but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience towards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often and miserably punished.",
      "Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of children recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it may be disguised.",
      "Whatever faults Levin had, there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him, and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their mother s face.",
      "On his invitation, the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother.",
      "Lily, too, began begging to go to him, and her mother handed her to him; he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her.",
      "Don t be afraid, don t be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!",
      "he said, smiling good-humoredly to the mother; there s no chance of my hurting or dropping her.",
      "And, looking at his strong, agile, assiduously careful and needlessly wary movements, the mother felt her mind at rest, and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him.",
      "Here, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, with whom he was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him, of childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him.",
      "As he ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic feats, set Miss Hoole laughing with his queer English accent, and talked to Darya Alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country.",
      "After dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on the balcony, began to speak of Kitty.",
      "You know, Kitty s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with me.",
      "Really, he said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation, he said: Then I ll send you two cows, shall I?",
      "If you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month; but it s really too bad of you.",
      "No, thank you.",
      "We can manage very well now.",
      "Oh, well, then, I ll have a look at your cows, and if you ll allow me, I ll give directions about their food.",
      "Everything depends on their food.",
      "And Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna the theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.",
      "He talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and, at the same time, was afraid of hearing it.",
      "He dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort.",
      "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to look after it?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.",
      "She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged, thanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any change in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin s knowledge of farming.",
      "General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk, she looked on with suspicion.",
      "It seemed to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management.",
      "It all seemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya Philimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundry maid s cow.",
      "That was clear.",
      "But general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure.",
      "And, what was most important, she wanted to talk about Kitty.",
      "Chapter 10 Kitty writes to me that there s nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude, Dolly said after the silence that had followed.",
      "And how is she better?",
      "Levin asked in agitation.",
      "Thank God, she s quite well again.",
      "I never believed her lungs were affected.",
      "Oh, I m very glad!",
      "said Levin, and Dolly fancied she saw something touching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face.",
      "Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile, why is it you are angry with Kitty?",
      "I m not angry with her, said Levin.",
      "Yes, you are angry.",
      "Why was it you did not come to see us nor them when you were in Moscow?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, he said, blushing up to the roots of his hair, I wonder really that with your kind heart you don t feel this.",
      "How it is you feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when you know.... What do I know?",
      "You know I made an offer and that I was refused, said Levin, and all the tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered.",
      "What makes you suppose I know?",
      "Because everybody knows it.... That s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though I had guessed it was so.",
      "Well, now you know it.",
      "All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it.",
      "And if she would not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else.",
      "But what did pass between you?",
      "Tell me.",
      "I have told you.",
      "When was it?",
      "When I was at their house the last time.",
      "Do you know that, said Darya Alexandrovna, I am awfully, awfully sorry for her.",
      "You suffer only from pride.... Perhaps so, said Levin, but.... She interrupted him.",
      "But she, poor girl ...",
      "I am awfully, awfully sorry for her.",
      "Now I see it all.",
      "Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me, he said, getting up.",
      "Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.",
      "No, wait a minute, she said, clutching him by the sleeve.",
      "Wait a minute, sit down.",
      "Please, please, don t let us talk of this, he said, sitting down, and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried.",
      "If I did not like you, she said, and tears came into her eyes; if I did not know you, as I do know you....",
      "The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose up and took possession of Levin s heart.",
      "Yes, I understand it all now, said Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "You can t understand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it s always clear whom you love.",
      "But a girl s in a position of suspense, with all a woman s or maiden s modesty, a girl who sees you men from afar, who takes everything on trust, a girl may have, and often has, such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say.",
      "Yes, if the heart does not speak.... No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views about a girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, you wait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are sure you love her, you make an offer.... Well, that s not quite it.",
      "Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from.",
      "But a girl is not asked.",
      "She is expected to make her choice, and yet she cannot choose, she can only answer yes or no.",
      "Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky, thought Levin, and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again, and only weighed on his heart and set it aching.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, he said, that s how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other, not love.",
      "The choice has been made, and so much the better.... And there can be no repeating it.",
      "Ah, pride, pride!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know.",
      "At the time when you made Kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer.",
      "She was in doubt.",
      "Doubt between you and Vronsky.",
      "Him she was seeing every day, and you she had not seen for a long while.",
      "Supposing she had been older ...",
      "I, for instance, in her place could have felt no doubt.",
      "I always disliked him, and so it has turned out.",
      "Levin recalled Kitty s answer.",
      "She had said: _No, that cannot be_.... Darya Alexandrovna, he said dryly, I appreciate your confidence in me; I believe you are making a mistake.",
      "But whether I am right or wrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina Alexandrovna out of the question for me, you understand, utterly out of the question.",
      "I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my sister, whom I love as I love my own children.",
      "I don t say she cared for you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing.",
      "I don t know!",
      "said Levin, jumping up.",
      "If you only knew how you are hurting me.",
      "It s just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were to say to you: He would have been like this and like that, and he might have lived, and how happy you would have been in him.",
      "But he s dead, dead, dead!...",
      "How absurd you are!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful tenderness at Levin s excitement.",
      "Yes, I see it all more and more clearly, she went on musingly.",
      "So you won t come to see us, then, when Kitty s here?",
      "No, I shan t come.",
      "Of course I won t avoid meeting Katerina Alexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the annoyance of my presence.",
      "You are very, very absurd, repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking with tenderness into his face.",
      "Very well then, let it be as though we had not spoken of this.",
      "What have you come for, Tanya?",
      "she said in French to the little girl who had come in.",
      "Where s my spade, mamma?",
      "I speak French, and you must too.",
      "The little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember the French for spade; the mother prompted her, and then told her in French where to look for the spade.",
      "And this made a disagreeable impression on Levin.",
      "Everything in Darya Alexandrovna s house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before.",
      "And what does she talk French with the children for?",
      "he thought; how unnatural and false it is!",
      "And the children feel it so: Learning French and unlearning sincerity, he thought to himself, unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to teach her children French in that way.",
      "But why are you going?",
      "Do stay a little.",
      "Levin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished, and he felt ill at ease.",
      "After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in, and, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed, with a troubled face, and tears in her eyes.",
      "While Levin had been outside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day, and her pride in her children.",
      "Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, hearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight.",
      "Tanya was pulling Grisha s hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her.",
      "Something snapped in Darya Alexandrovna s heart when she saw this.",
      "It was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children of hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal propensities wicked children.",
      "She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak to Levin of her misery.",
      "Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it, he was thinking in his heart: No, I won t be artificial and talk French with my children; but my children won t be like that.",
      "All one has to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and they ll be delightful.",
      "No, my children won t be like that.",
      "He said good-bye and drove away, and she did not try to keep him.",
      "Chapter 11 In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin s sister s estate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay.",
      "The chief source of income on his sister s estate was from the riverside meadows.",
      "In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three acres.",
      "When Levin took over the management of the estate, he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the price at twenty-five roubles the three acres.",
      "The peasants would not give that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.",
      "Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut, partly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop.",
      "His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double.",
      "The previous year which was the third year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system.",
      "This year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and that, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had divided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner s share.",
      "From the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone of the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay, and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter.",
      "Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother s wet-nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his bee-house, wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay.",
      "Parmenitch, a talkative, comely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was doing, told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year; but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin s inquiries about the mowing.",
      "This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions.",
      "He went to the hay fields and examined the stacks.",
      "The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack, and carry it into the barn.",
      "There turned out to be only thirty-two loads in the stack.",
      "In spite of the village elder s assertions about the compressibility of hay, and its having settled down in the stacks, and his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God, Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders, and that, therefore, he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack.",
      "After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each.",
      "The arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon.",
      "When the last of the hay had been divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the counting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants.",
      "In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a bright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble.",
      "After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks.",
      "To the left, carts were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one after another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hind-quarters.",
      "What weather for haying!",
      "What hay it ll be!",
      "said an old man, squatting down beside Levin.",
      "It s tea, not hay!",
      "It s like scattering grain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!",
      "he added, pointing to the growing haycocks.",
      "Since dinner time they ve carried a good half of it.",
      "The last load, eh?",
      "he shouted to a young peasant, who drove by, standing in the front of an empty cart, shaking the cord reins.",
      "The last, dad!",
      "the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse, and, smiling, he looked round at a bright, rosy-cheeked peasant girl who sat in the cart smiling too, and drove on.",
      "Your son?",
      "My baby, said the old man with a tender smile.",
      "What a fine fellow!",
      "The lad s all right.",
      "Married already?",
      "Yes, it s two years last St. Philip s day.",
      "Any children?",
      "Children indeed!",
      "Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself, and bashful too, answered the old man.",
      "Well, the hay!",
      "It s as fragrant as tea!",
      "he repeated, wishing to change the subject.",
      "Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife.",
      "They were loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him.",
      "Ivan Parmenov was standing on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork.",
      "The young wife worked easily, merrily, and dexterously.",
      "The close-packed hay did not once break away off her fork.",
      "First she gathered it together, stuck the fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the white smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart.",
      "Ivan, obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart.",
      "As she raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the sun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load.",
      "Ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she said he laughed aloud.",
      "In the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous, young, freshly awakened love.",
      "Chapter 12 The load was tied on.",
      "Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse by the bridle.",
      "The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a bold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, who were forming a ring for the haymakers dance.",
      "Ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded carts.",
      "The peasant women, with their rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and chattering with ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart.",
      "One wild untrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through a verse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing in unison.",
      "The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment.",
      "The storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping.",
      "Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life.",
      "But he could do nothing, and had to lie and look on and listen.",
      "When the peasants, with their singing, had vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation, his physical inactivity, his alienation from this world, came over Levin.",
      "Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had tried to cheat him, those very peasants had greeted him good-humoredly, and evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him, any regret, any recollection even of having tried to deceive him.",
      "All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor.",
      "God gave the day, God gave the strength.",
      "And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward.",
      "For whom the labor?",
      "What would be its fruits?",
      "These were idle considerations beside the point.",
      "Often Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to his young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious, pure, and socially delightful life.",
      "The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the people had all separated.",
      "Those who lived near had gone home, while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to spend the night in the meadow.",
      "Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still lay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused.",
      "The peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night.",
      "At first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.",
      "All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart.",
      "Before the early dawn all was hushed.",
      "Nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh, and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the morning.",
      "Rousing himself, Levin got up from the haycock, and looking at the stars, he saw that the night was over.",
      "Well, what am I going to do?",
      "How am I to set about it?",
      "he said to himself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in that brief night.",
      "All the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought.",
      "One was the renunciation of his old life, of his utterly useless education.",
      "This renunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy and simple.",
      "Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now.",
      "The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of this life he felt clearly, and he was convinced he would find in it the content, the peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious.",
      "But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new.",
      "And there nothing took clear shape for him.",
      "Have a wife?",
      "Have work and the necessity of work?",
      "Leave Pokrovskoe?",
      "Buy land?",
      "Become a member of a peasant community?",
      "Marry a peasant girl?",
      "he asked himself again, and could not find an answer.",
      "I haven t slept all night, though, and I can t think it out clearly, he said to himself.",
      "I ll work it out later.",
      "One thing s certain, this night has decided my fate.",
      "All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing, he told himself.",
      "It s all ever so much simpler and better.... How beautiful!",
      "he thought, looking at the strange, as it were, mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky.",
      "How exquisite it all is in this exquisite night!",
      "And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?",
      "Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it only two white streaks.",
      "Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed!",
      "He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the village.",
      "A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen.",
      "The gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, the full triumph of light over darkness.",
      "Shrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the ground.",
      "What s that?",
      "Someone coming, he thought, catching the tinkle of bells, and lifting his head.",
      "Forty paces from him a carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road on which he was walking.",
      "The shaft-horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road.",
      "This was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could be, he gazed absently at the coach.",
      "In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window, evidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap.",
      "With a face full of light and thought, full of a subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from Levin, she was gazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.",
      "At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful eyes glanced at him.",
      "She recognized him, and her face lighted up with wondering delight.",
      "He could not be mistaken.",
      "There were no other eyes like those in the world.",
      "There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life.",
      "It was she.",
      "It was Kitty.",
      "He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway station.",
      "And everything that had been stirring Levin during that sleepless night, all the resolutions he had made, all vanished at once.",
      "He recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl.",
      "There only, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late.",
      "She did not look out again.",
      "The sound of the carriage-springs was no longer audible, the bells could scarcely be heard.",
      "The barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village, and all that was left was the empty fields all round, the village in front, and he himself isolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted highroad.",
      "He glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night.",
      "There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell.",
      "There, in the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been accomplished.",
      "There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets.",
      "The sky had grown blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the same remoteness, it met his questioning gaze.",
      "No, he said to himself, however good that life of simplicity and toil may be, I cannot go back to it.",
      "I love _her_.",
      "Chapter 13 None but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew that, while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men, he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved.",
      "The sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation, and he utterly lost all power of reflection.",
      "The chief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware of this, and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin their chances.",
      "He will get angry, and will not listen to you, they used to say.",
      "And as a fact, in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey Alexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.",
      "I can do nothing.",
      "Kindly leave the room!",
      "he would commonly cry in such cases.",
      "When returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations with Vronsky, and immediately afterwards had burst into tears, hiding her face in her hands, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for all the fury aroused in him against her, was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears.",
      "Conscious of it, and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the position, he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at her.",
      "This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.",
      "When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage, and making an effort to master himself, took leave of her with his usual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing; he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.",
      "His wife s words, confirming his worst suspicions, had sent a cruel pang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "That pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears.",
      "But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch, to his surprise and delight, felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy.",
      "He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache.",
      "After a fearful agony and a sense of something huge, bigger than the head itself, being torn out of his jaw, the sufferer, hardly able to believe in his own good luck, feels all at once that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his attention, exists no longer, and that he can live and think again, and take interest in other things besides his tooth.",
      "This feeling Alexey Alexandrovitch was experiencing.",
      "The agony had been strange and terrible, but now it was over; he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife.",
      "No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman.",
      "I always knew it and always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her, he said to himself.",
      "And it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it: he recalled incidents of their past life, in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman.",
      "I made a mistake in linking my life to hers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be unhappy.",
      "It s not I that am to blame, he told himself, but she.",
      "But I have nothing to do with her.",
      "She does not exist for me.... Everything relating to her and her son, towards whom his sentiments were as much changed as towards her, ceased to interest him.",
      "The only thing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could best, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most justice, extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable, and useful existence.",
      "I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime.",
      "I have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me.",
      "And I shall find it, he said to himself, frowning more and more.",
      "I m not the first nor the last.",
      "And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the Fair Helen of Menelaus, recently revived in the memory of all, a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch s imagination.",
      "Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince Karibanov, Count Paskudin, Dram....",
      "Yes, even Dram, such an honest, capable fellow ... Semyonov, Tchagin, Sigonin, Alexey Alexandrovitch remembered.",
      "Admitting that a certain quite irrational _ridicule_ falls to the lot of these men, yet I never saw anything but a misfortune in it, and always felt sympathy for it, Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, though indeed this was not the fact, and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind, but the more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands, the more highly he had thought of himself.",
      "It is a misfortune which may befall anyone.",
      "And this misfortune has befallen me.",
      "The only thing to be done is to make the best of the position.",
      "And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in.",
      "Daryalov fought a duel....",
      "The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey Alexandrovitch in his youth, just because he was physically a coward, and was himself well aware of the fact.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself, and had never made use of any weapon in his life.",
      "This horror had in his youth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger.",
      "Having attained success and an established position in the world, he had long ago forgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself, and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that Alexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one.",
      "There s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it s not the same in England) that very many and among these were those whose opinion Alexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued look favorably on the duel; but what result is attained by it?",
      "Suppose I call him out, Alexey Alexandrovitch went on to himself, and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge, and the pistol aimed at him, he shuddered, and knew that he never would do it suppose I call him out.",
      "Suppose I am taught, he went on musing, to shoot; I press the trigger, he said to himself, closing his eyes, and it turns out I have killed him, Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas.",
      "What sense is there in murdering a man in order to define one s relation to a guilty wife and son?",
      "I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with her.",
      "But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur I should be killed or wounded.",
      "I, the innocent person, should be the victim killed or wounded.",
      "It s even more senseless.",
      "But apart from that, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side.",
      "Don t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by Russia, to be exposed to danger?",
      "Knowing perfectly well beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.",
      "That would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving myself and others.",
      "A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of me.",
      "My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.",
      "Official duties, which had always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch s eyes, seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment.",
      "Considering and rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered.",
      "Passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar), Alexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view.",
      "In all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife, and the very party which, being in fault, had not the right to contract a fresh marriage, had formed counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a self-styled husband.",
      "In his own case, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a legal divorce, that is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated, was impossible of attainment.",
      "He saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife s guilt, required by the law, out of the question; he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward, even if he had them, and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her.",
      "An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society.",
      "His chief object, to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by divorce either.",
      "Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover.",
      "And in spite of the complete, as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would be to her advantage.",
      "The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey Alexandrovitch, that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony, and got up and changed his place in the carriage, and for a long while after, he sat with scowling brows, wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug.",
      "Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov, Paskudin, and that good fellow Dram that is, separate from one s wife, he went on thinking, when he had regained his composure.",
      "But this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce, and what was more, a separation, quite as much as a regular divorce, flung his wife into the arms of Vronsky.",
      "No, it s out of the question, out of the question!",
      "he said again, twisting his rug about him again.",
      "I cannot be unhappy, but neither she nor he ought to be happy.",
      "The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been with agony extracted by his wife s words.",
      "But that feeling had been replaced by another, the desire, not merely that she should not be triumphant, but that she should get due punishment for her crime.",
      "He did not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind his honor.",
      "And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a duel, a divorce, a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey Alexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution, to keep her with him, concealing what had happened from the world, and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue, and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her.",
      "I must inform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external _status quo_, and that such I agree to retain, on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes, that is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her lover.",
      "When this decision had been finally adopted, another weighty consideration occurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it.",
      "By such a course only shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion, he told himself.",
      "In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty wife, but giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as the task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation.",
      "Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it seemed to him, with the requirements of religion, this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some extent restored his peace of mind.",
      "He was pleased to think that, even in such an important crisis in life, no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference.",
      "As he pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey Alexandrovitch did not see, indeed, why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before.",
      "No doubt, she could never regain his esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any sort of reason that his existence should be troubled, and that he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife.",
      "Yes, time will pass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be reestablished, Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself; so far reestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life.",
      "She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to blame, and so I cannot be unhappy.",
      "Chapter 14 As he neared Petersburg, Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered entirely to his decision, but was even composing in his head the letter he would write to his wife.",
      "Going into the porter s room, Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his office, and directed that they should be brought to him in his study.",
      "The horses can be taken out and I will see no one, he said in answer to the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his agreeable frame of mind, emphasizing the words, see no one.",
      "In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and stopped at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already been lighted by the valet who had preceded him.",
      "He cracked his knuckles and sat down, sorting out his writing appurtenances.",
      "Putting his elbows on the table, he bent his head on one side, thought a minute, and began to write, without pausing for a second.",
      "He wrote without using any form of address to her, and wrote in French, making use of the plural _vous_, which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding Russian form.",
      "At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that conversation.",
      "Having carefully considered everything, I am writing now with the object of fulfilling that promise.",
      "My decision is as follows.",
      "Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power.",
      "The family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of one of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has done in the past.",
      "This is essential for me, for you, and for our son.",
      "I am fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has called forth the present letter, and that you will cooperate with me in eradicating the cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past.",
      "In the contrary event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son.",
      "All this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview.",
      "As the season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to Petersburg as quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday.",
      "All necessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here.",
      "I beg you to note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this request.",
      "A. Karenin _P.S._ I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.",
      "He read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially that he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word, not a reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence.",
      "Most of all, it was a golden bridge for return.",
      "Folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the money, he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the well arranged appointments of his writing-table.",
      "Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow at the summer villa, he said, getting up.",
      "Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study, and playing with the massive paper-knife, he moved to his easy chair, near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on Egyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun.",
      "Over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna, a fine painting by a celebrated artist.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it.",
      "The unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him.",
      "Insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch s eyes of the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter, the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered with rings.",
      "After looking at the portrait for a minute, Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the sound brrr, and turned away.",
      "He made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book.",
      "He tried to read, but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics.",
      "He looked at the book and thought of something else.",
      "He thought not of his wife, but of a complication that had arisen in his official life, which at the time constituted the chief interest of it.",
      "He felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair, and that he had originated a leading idea he could say it without self-flattery calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen him in his official career, to discomfit his enemies, and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the government.",
      "Directly the servant had set the tea and left the room, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the writing-table.",
      "Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of papers, with a scarcely perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication.",
      "The complication was of this nature: Alexey Alexandrovitch s characteristic quality as a politician, that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his reserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career, was his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his economy.",
      "It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky province, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch s department, and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this.",
      "The irrigation of these lands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of Alexey Alexandrovitch s predecessor.",
      "And vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business, and utterly unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on entering office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of Irrigation.",
      "But at first, when he did not yet feel secure in his position, he knew it would affect too many interests, and would be injudicious.",
      "Later on he had been engrossed in other questions, and had simply forgotten the Board of Irrigation.",
      "It went of itself, like all such boards, by the mere force of inertia.",
      "(Many people gained their livelihood by the Board of Irrigation, especially one highly conscientious and musical family: all the daughters played on stringed instruments, and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters.)",
      "The raising of this question by a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch s opinion a dishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were things similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for well-known reasons of official etiquette.",
      "However, now that the glove had been thrown down to him, he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky province.",
      "But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either.",
      "He demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee.",
      "The question of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the Commission of the 2nd of June, and had been pressed forward actively by Alexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes.",
      "In the commission this question had been a ground of contention between several departments.",
      "The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that if there were anything wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the part of Alexey Alexandrovitch s department to carry out the measures prescribed by law.",
      "Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First, that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly, if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands of the committee, that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the (1) political, (2) administrative, (3) economic, (4) ethnographical, (5) material, and (6) religious points of view; thirdly, that evidence should be required from the rival department of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that department for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that department explain why it had, as appeared from the evidence before the committee, from No.",
      "17,015 and 18,038, from December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864, acted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T... Act 18, and the note to Act 36.",
      "A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit.",
      "Having filled a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and sent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain necessary facts for him.",
      "Getting up and walking about the room, he glanced again at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.",
      "After reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and renewing his interest in it, Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at eleven o clock, and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife, he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light.",
      "Chapter 15 Though Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky when he told her their position was impossible, at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, and she longed with her whole soul to change it.",
      "On the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so, she was glad of it.",
      "After her husband had left her, she told herself that she was glad, that now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more lying and deception.",
      "It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever.",
      "It might be bad, this new position, but it would be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.",
      "The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought.",
      "That evening she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband, though, to make the position definite, it was necessary to tell him.",
      "When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband, and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine what would come of it.",
      "But the words were spoken, and Alexey Alexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything.",
      "I saw Vronsky and did not tell him.",
      "At the very instant he was going away I would have turned him back and told him, but I changed my mind, because it was strange that I had not told him the first minute.",
      "Why was it I wanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
      "And in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face.",
      "She knew what had kept her from it, she knew that she had been ashamed.",
      "Her position, which had seemed to her simplified the night before, suddenly struck her now as not only not simple, but as absolutely hopeless.",
      "She felt terrified at the disgrace, of which she had not ever thought before.",
      "Directly she thought of what her husband would do, the most terrible ideas came to her mind.",
      "She had a vision of being turned out of the house, of her shame being proclaimed to all the world.",
      "She asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house, and she could not find an answer.",
      "When she thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her that he did not love her, that he was already beginning to be tired of her, that she could not offer herself to him, and she felt bitter against him for it.",
      "It seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband, and had continually repeated in her imagination, she had said to everyone, and everyone had heard them.",
      "She could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face.",
      "She could not bring herself to call her maid, and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess.",
      "The maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, came into her room of her own accord.",
      "Anna glanced inquiringly into her face, and blushed with a scared look.",
      "The maid begged her pardon for coming in, saying that she had fancied the bell rang.",
      "She brought her clothes and a note.",
      "The note was from Betsy.",
      "Betsy reminded her that Liza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov.",
      "Come, if only as a study in morals.",
      "I shall expect you, she finished.",
      "Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh.",
      "Nothing, I need nothing, she said to Annushka, who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table.",
      "You can go.",
      "I ll dress at once and come down.",
      "I need nothing.",
      "Annushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat in the same position, her head and hands hanging listlessly, and every now and then she shivered all over, seemed as though she would make some gesture, utter some word, and sank back into lifelessness again.",
      "She repeated continually, My God!",
      "But neither God nor my had any meaning to her.",
      "The idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch himself, although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up.",
      "She knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life.",
      "She was not simply miserable, she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition, never experienced before, in which she found herself.",
      "She felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to over-tired eyes.",
      "She hardly knew at times what it was she feared, and what she hoped for.",
      "Whether she feared or desired what had happened, or what was going to happen, and exactly what she longed for, she could not have said.",
      "Ah, what am I doing!",
      "she said to herself, feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head.",
      "When she came to herself, she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands, each side of her temples, and pulling it.",
      "She jumped up, and began walking about.",
      "The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting, said Annushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the same position.",
      "Seryozha?",
      "What about Seryozha?",
      "Anna asked, with sudden eagerness, recollecting her son s existence for the first time that morning.",
      "He s been naughty, I think, answered Annushka with a smile.",
      "In what way?",
      "Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room.",
      "I think he slipped in and ate one of them on the sly.",
      "The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself.",
      "She recalled the partly sincere, though greatly exaggerated, r le of the mother living for her child, which she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from her relation to her husband or to Vronsky.",
      "This support was her son.",
      "In whatever position she might be placed, she could not lose her son.",
      "Her husband might put her to shame and turn her out, Vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach); she could not leave her son.",
      "She had an aim in life.",
      "And she must act; act to secure this relation to her son, so that he might not be taken from her.",
      "Quickly indeed, as quickly as possible, she must take action before he was taken from her.",
      "She must take her son and go away.",
      "Here was the one thing she had to do now.",
      "She needed consolation.",
      "She must be calm, and get out of this insufferable position.",
      "The thought of immediate action binding her to her son, of going away somewhere with him, gave her this consolation.",
      "She dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked into the drawing-room, where she found, as usual, waiting for her, the coffee, Seryozha, and his governess.",
      "Seryozha, all in white, with his back and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well, and in which he resembled his father, he was doing something to the flowers he carried.",
      "The governess had a particularly severe expression.",
      "Seryozha screamed shrilly, as he often did, Ah, mamma!",
      "and stopped, hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers, or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers.",
      "The governess, after saying good-morning, began a long and detailed account of Seryozha s naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her; she was considering whether she would take her with her or not.",
      "No, I won t take her, she decided.",
      "I ll go alone with my child.",
      "Yes, it s very wrong, said Anna, and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him.",
      "Leave him to me, she said to the astonished governess, and not letting go of her son, she sat down at the table, where coffee was set ready for her.",
      "Mamma!",
      "I ...",
      "I ... didn t.... he said, trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches.",
      "Seryozha, she said, as soon as the governess had left the room, that was wrong, but you ll never do it again, will you?...",
      "You love me?",
      "She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes.",
      "Can I help loving him?",
      "she said to herself, looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes.",
      "And can he ever join his father in punishing me?",
      "Is it possible he will not feel for me?",
      "Tears were already flowing down her face, and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on to the terrace.",
      "After the thunder showers of the last few days, cold, bright weather had set in.",
      "The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves.",
      "She shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air.",
      "Run along, run along to Mariette, she said to Seryozha, who had followed her out, and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace.",
      "Can it be that they won t forgive me, won t understand how it all couldn t be helped?",
      "she said to herself.",
      "Standing still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine, she knew that they would not forgive her, that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky, that green.",
      "And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul.",
      "I mustn t, mustn t think, she said to herself.",
      "I must get ready.",
      "To go where?",
      "Whom to take with me?",
      "Yes, to Moscow by the evening train.",
      "Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things.",
      "But first I must write to them both.",
      "She went quickly indoors into her boudoir, sat down at the table, and wrote to her husband: After what has happened, I cannot remain any longer in your house.",
      "I am going away, and taking my son with me.",
      "I don t know the law, and so I don t know with which of the parents the son should remain; but I take him with me because I cannot live without him.",
      "Be generous, leave him to me.",
      "Up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal to his generosity, a quality she did not recognize in him, and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching, pulled her up.",
      "Of my fault and my remorse I cannot speak, because.... She stopped again, finding no connection in her ideas.",
      "No, she said to herself, there s no need of anything, and tearing up the letter, she wrote it again, leaving out the allusion to generosity, and sealed it up.",
      "Another letter had to be written to Vronsky.",
      "I have told my husband, she wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write more.",
      "It was so coarse, so unfeminine.",
      "And what more am I to write to him?",
      "Again a flush of shame spread over her face; she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits.",
      "No need of anything, she said to herself, and closing her blotting-case she went upstairs, told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to Moscow, and at once set to work to pack up her things.",
      "Chapter 16 All the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and footmen going to and fro carrying out things.",
      "Cupboards and chests were open; twice they had sent to the shop for cord; pieces of newspaper were tossing about on the floor.",
      "Two trunks, some bags and strapped-up rugs, had been carried down into the hall.",
      "The carriage and two hired cabs were waiting at the steps.",
      "Anna, forgetting her inward agitation in the work of packing, was standing at a table in her boudoir, packing her traveling bag, when Annushka called her attention to the rattle of some carriage driving up.",
      "Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch s courier on the steps, ringing at the front door bell.",
      "Run and find out what it is, she said, and with a calm sense of being prepared for anything, she sat down in a low chair, folding her hands on her knees.",
      "A footman brought in a thick packet directed in Alexey Alexandrovitch s hand.",
      "The courier has orders to wait for an answer, he said.",
      "Very well, she said, and as soon as he had left the room she tore open the letter with trembling fingers.",
      "A roll of unfolded notes done up in a wrapper fell out of it.",
      "She disengaged the letter and began reading it at the end.",
      "Preparations shall be made for your arrival here ...",
      "I attach particular significance to compliance.... she read.",
      "She ran on, then back, read it all through, and once more read the letter all through again from the beginning.",
      "When she had finished, she felt that she was cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as she had not expected, had burst upon her.",
      "In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband, and wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken.",
      "And here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her what she had wanted.",
      "But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything she had been able to conceive.",
      "He s right!",
      "she said; of course, he s always right; he s a Christian, he s generous!",
      "Yes, vile, base creature!",
      "And no one understands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can t explain it.",
      "They say he s so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever; but they don t see what I ve seen.",
      "They don t know how he has crushed my life for eight years, crushed everything that was living in me he has not once even thought that I m a live woman who must have love.",
      "They don t know how at every step he s humiliated me, and been just as pleased with himself.",
      "Haven t I striven, striven with all my strength, to find something to give meaning to my life?",
      "Haven t I struggled to love him, to love my son when I could not love my husband?",
      "But the time came when I knew that I couldn t cheat myself any longer, that I was alive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I must love and live.",
      "And now what does he do?",
      "If he d killed me, if he d killed him, I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven anything; but, no, he.... How was it I didn t guess what he would do?",
      "He s doing just what s characteristic of his mean character.",
      "He ll keep himself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he ll drive still lower to worse ruin yet.... She recalled the words from the letter.",
      "You can conjecture what awaits you and your son.... That s a threat to take away my child, and most likely by their stupid law he can.",
      "But I know very well why he says it.",
      "He doesn t believe even in my love for my child, or he despises it (just as he always used to ridicule it).",
      "He despises that feeling in me, but he knows that I won t abandon my child, that I can t abandon my child, that there could be no life for me without my child, even with him whom I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from him, I should be acting like the most infamous, basest of women.",
      "He knows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.",
      "She recalled another sentence in the letter.",
      "Our life must go on as it has done in the past.... That life was miserable enough in the old days; it has been awful of late.",
      "What will it be now?",
      "And he knows all that; he knows that I can t repent that I breathe, that I love; he knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to go on torturing me.",
      "I know him; I know that he s at home and is happy in deceit, like a fish swimming in the water.",
      "No, I won t give him that happiness.",
      "I ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants to catch me, come what may.",
      "Anything s better than lying and deceit.",
      "Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...",
      "No; I will break through it, I will break through it!",
      "she cried, jumping up and keeping back her tears.",
      "And she went to the writing-table to write him another letter.",
      "But at the bottom of her heart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through anything, that she was not strong enough to get out of her old position, however false and dishonorable it might be.",
      "She sat down at the writing-table, but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, burst into tears, with sobs and heaving breast like a child crying.",
      "She was weeping that her dream of her position being made clear and definite had been annihilated forever.",
      "She knew beforehand that everything would go on in the old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way.",
      "She felt that the position in the world that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to her of so little consequence in the morning, that this position was precious to her, that she would not have the strength to exchange it for the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and child to join her lover; that however much she might struggle, she could not be stronger than herself.",
      "She would never know freedom in love, but would remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of detection hanging over her at every instant; deceiving her husband for the sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from her, whose life she could never share.",
      "She knew that this was how it would be, and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even conceive what it would end in.",
      "And she cried without restraint, as children cry when they are punished.",
      "The sound of the footman s steps forced her to rouse herself, and, hiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing.",
      "The courier asks if there s an answer, the footman announced.",
      "An answer?",
      "Let him wait.",
      "I ll ring.",
      "What can I write?",
      "What can I decide upon alone?",
      "What do I know?",
      "What do I want?",
      "What is there I care for?",
      "Again she felt that her soul was beginning to be split in two.",
      "She was terrified again at this feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing something which might divert her thoughts from herself.",
      "I ought to see Alexey (so she called Vronsky in her thoughts); no one but he can tell me what I ought to do.",
      "I ll go to Betsy s, perhaps I shall see him there, she said to herself, completely forgetting that when she had told him the day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya s, he had said that in that case he should not go either.",
      "She went up to the table, wrote to her husband, I have received your letter.",
      "A. ; and, ringing the bell, gave it to the footman.",
      "We are not going, she said to Annushka, as she came in.",
      "Not going at all?",
      "No; don t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait.",
      "I m going to the princess s. Which dress am I to get ready?",
      "Chapter 17 The croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers.",
      "These two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in imitation of some imitation, _les sept merveilles du monde_.",
      "These ladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was utterly hostile to that in which Anna moved.",
      "Moreover, Stremov, one of the most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of Liza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch s enemy in the political world.",
      "From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the hints in Princess Tverskaya s note referred to her refusal.",
      "But now Anna was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.",
      "Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya s earlier than the other guests.",
      "At the same moment as she entered, Vronsky s footman, with side-whiskers combed out like a _Kammerjunker_, went in too.",
      "He stopped at the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass.",
      "Anna recognized him, and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come.",
      "Most likely he was sending a note to say so.",
      "As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman, pronouncing his _r s_ even like a _Kammerjunker_, say, From the count for the princess, and hand the note.",
      "She longed to question him as to where his master was.",
      "She longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself to see him.",
      "But neither the first nor the second nor the third course was possible.",
      "Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival ahead of her, and Princess Tverskaya s footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.",
      "The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately.",
      "Would you be pleased to walk into the garden?",
      "announced another footman in another room.",
      "The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at home worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step, impossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among outsiders, in company so uncongenial to her present mood.",
      "But she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her.",
      "She was not alone; all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to, and she felt less wretched than at home.",
      "She was not forced to think what she was to do.",
      "Everything would be done of itself.",
      "On meeting Betsy coming towards her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her just as she always did.",
      "Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch and a young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents in the provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.",
      "There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it at once.",
      "I slept badly, answered Anna, looking intently at the footman who came to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought Vronsky s note.",
      "How glad I am you ve come!",
      "said Betsy.",
      "I m tired, and was just longing to have some tea before they come.",
      "You might go she turned to Tushkevitch with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where they ve been cutting it.",
      "We shall have time to talk a little over tea; we ll have a cozy chat, eh?",
      "she said in English to Anna, with a smile, pressing the hand with which she held a parasol.",
      "Yes, especially as I can t stay very long with you.",
      "I m forced to go on to old Madame Vrede.",
      "I ve been promising to go for a century, said Anna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her nature, had become not merely simple and natural in society, but a positive source of satisfaction.",
      "Why she said this, which she had not thought of a second before, she could not have explained.",
      "She had said it simply from the reflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she had better secure her own freedom, and try to see him somehow.",
      "But why she had spoken of old Madame Vrede, whom she had to go and see, as she had to see many other people, she could not have explained; and yet, as it afterwards turned out, had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky, she could have thought of nothing better.",
      "I m not going to let you go for anything, answered Betsy, looking intently into Anna s face.",
      "Really, if I were not fond of you, I should feel offended.",
      "One would think you were afraid my society would compromise you.",
      "Tea in the little dining-room, please, she said, half closing her eyes, as she always did when addressing the footman.",
      "Taking the note from him, she read it.",
      "Alexey s playing us false, she said in French; he writes that he can t come, she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that Vronsky could mean anything more to Anna than a game of croquet.",
      "Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but, hearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her, she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing.",
      "said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the matter, and she went on smiling: How can you or your friends compromise anyone?",
      "This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great fascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women.",
      "And it was not the necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment was contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted her.",
      "I can t be more Catholic than the Pope, she said.",
      "Stremov and Liza Merkalova, why, they re the cream of the cream of society.",
      "Besides, they re received everywhere, and _I_ she laid special stress on the I have never been strict and intolerant.",
      "It s simply that I haven t the time.",
      "No; you don t care, perhaps, to meet Stremov?",
      "Let him and Alexey Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee that s no affair of ours.",
      "But in the world, he s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted croquet player.",
      "You shall see.",
      "And, in spite of his absurd position as Liza s lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off the absurd position.",
      "He s very nice.",
      "Sappho Shtoltz you don t know?",
      "Oh, that s a new type, quite new.",
      "Betsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her good-humored, shrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight, and was hatching something for her benefit.",
      "They were in the little boudoir.",
      "I must write to Alexey though, and Betsy sat down to the table, scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.",
      "I m telling him to come to dinner.",
      "I ve one lady extra to dinner with me, and no man to take her in.",
      "Look what I ve said, will that persuade him?",
      "Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute.",
      "Would you seal it up, please, and send it off?",
      "she said from the door; I have to give some directions.",
      "Without a moment s thought, Anna sat down to the table with Betsy s letter, and, without reading it, wrote below: It s essential for me to see you.",
      "Come to the Vrede garden.",
      "I shall be there at six o clock.",
      "She sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in her presence handed the note to be taken.",
      "At tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little drawing-room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women.",
      "They criticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell upon Liza Merkalova.",
      "She s very sweet, and I always liked her, said Anna.",
      "You ought to like her.",
      "She raves about you.",
      "Yesterday she came up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you.",
      "She says you re a real heroine of romance, and that if she were a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake.",
      "Stremov says she does that as it is.",
      "But do tell me, please, I never could make it out, said Anna, after being silent for some time, speaking in a tone that showed she was not asking an idle question, but that what she was asking was of more importance to her than it should have been; do tell me, please, what are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as he s called?",
      "I ve met them so little.",
      "Betsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna.",
      "It s a new manner, she said.",
      "They ve all adopted that manner.",
      "They ve flung their caps over the windmills.",
      "But there are ways and ways of flinging them.",
      "Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?",
      "Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, a thing which rarely happened with her.",
      "You re encroaching on Princess Myakaya s special domain now.",
      "That s the question of an _enfant terrible_, and Betsy obviously tried to restrain herself, but could not, and went off into peals of that infectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often.",
      "You d better ask them, she brought out, between tears of laughter.",
      "No; you laugh, said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself, but I never could understand it.",
      "I can t understand the husband s r le in it.",
      "The husband?",
      "Liza Merkalova s husband carries her shawl, and is always ready to be of use.",
      "But anything more than that in reality, no one cares to inquire.",
      "You know in decent society one doesn t talk or think even of certain details of the toilet.",
      "That s how it is with this.",
      "Will you be at Madame Rolandak s f te?",
      "asked Anna, to change the conversation.",
      "I don t think so, answered Betsy, and, without looking at her friend, she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea.",
      "Putting a cup before Anna, she took out a cigarette, and, fitting it into a silver holder, she lighted it.",
      "It s like this, you see: I m in a fortunate position, she began, quite serious now, as she took up her cup.",
      "I understand you, and I understand Liza.",
      "Liza now is one of those na ve natures that, like children, don t know what s good and what s bad.",
      "Anyway, she didn t comprehend it when she was very young.",
      "And now she s aware that the lack of comprehension suits her.",
      "Now, perhaps, she doesn t know on purpose, said Betsy, with a subtle smile.",
      "But, anyway, it suits her.",
      "The very same thing, don t you see, may be looked at tragically, and turned into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even humorously.",
      "Possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically.",
      "How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!",
      "said Anna, seriously and dreamily.",
      "Am I worse than other people, or better?",
      "I think I m worse.",
      "_Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!_ repeated Betsy.",
      "But here they are.",
      "Chapter 18 They heard the sound of steps and a man s voice, then a woman s voice and laughter, and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming with excess of health, the so-called Vaska.",
      "It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak, truffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour.",
      "Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one second.",
      "He walked after Sappho into the drawing-room, and followed her about as though he were chained to her, keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her.",
      "Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes.",
      "She walked with smart little steps in high-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man.",
      "Anna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her beauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried, and the boldness of her manners.",
      "On her head there was such a superstructure of soft, golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was exposed in front.",
      "The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress, and the question involuntarily rose to the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked in front, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.",
      "Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.",
      "Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers, she began telling them at once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she flung back at one stroke all on one side.",
      "I drove here with Vaska.... Ah, to be sure, you don t know each other.",
      "And mentioning his surname she introduced the young man, and reddening a little, broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake that is, at her having called him Vaska to a stranger.",
      "Vaska bowed once more to Anna, but he said nothing to her.",
      "He addressed Sappho: You ve lost your bet.",
      "We got here first.",
      "Pay up, said he, smiling.",
      "Sappho laughed still more festively.",
      "Not just now, said she.",
      "Oh, all right, I ll have it later.",
      "Very well, very well.",
      "Oh, yes.",
      "She turned suddenly to Princess Betsy: I am a nice person ...",
      "I positively forgot it ...",
      "I ve brought you a visitor.",
      "And here he comes.",
      "The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho had invited, and whom she had forgotten, was, however, a personage of such consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the ladies rose on his entrance.",
      "He was a new admirer of Sappho s. He now dogged her footsteps, like Vaska.",
      "Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived, and Liza Merkalova with Stremov.",
      "Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette, with an Oriental, languid type of face, and as everyone used to say exquisite enigmatic eyes.",
      "The tone of her dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty.",
      "Liza was as soft and enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.",
      "But to Anna s taste Liza was far more attractive.",
      "Betsy had said to Anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when Anna saw her, she felt that this was not the truth.",
      "She really was both innocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman.",
      "It is true that her tone was the same as Sappho s; that like Sappho, she had two men, one young and one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their eyes.",
      "But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her.",
      "There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.",
      "This glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes.",
      "The weary, and at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by dark rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity.",
      "Everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly, and knowing her, could not but love her.",
      "At the sight of Anna, her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight.",
      "she said, going up to her.",
      "Yesterday at the races all I wanted was to get to you, but you d gone away.",
      "I did so want to see you, yesterday especially.",
      "Wasn t it awful?",
      "she said, looking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul.",
      "Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling, said Anna, blushing.",
      "The company got up at this moment to go into the garden.",
      "I m not going, said Liza, smiling and settling herself close to Anna.",
      "You won t go either, will you?",
      "Who wants to play croquet?",
      "Oh, I like it, said Anna.",
      "There, how do you manage never to be bored by things?",
      "It s delightful to look at you.",
      "You re alive, but I m bored.",
      "How can you be bored?",
      "Why, you live in the liveliest set in Petersburg, said Anna.",
      "Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but we I certainly are not happy, but awfully, awfully bored.",
      "Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men.",
      "Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.",
      "What, bored!",
      "Sappho says they did enjoy themselves tremendously at your house last night.",
      "Ah, how dreary it all was!",
      "said Liza Merkalova.",
      "We all drove back to my place after the races.",
      "And always the same people, always the same.",
      "Always the same thing.",
      "We lounged about on sofas all the evening.",
      "What is there to enjoy in that?",
      "No; do tell me how you manage never to be bored?",
      "she said, addressing Anna again.",
      "One has but to look at you and one sees, here s a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but isn t bored.",
      "Tell me how you do it?",
      "I do nothing, answered Anna, blushing at these searching questions.",
      "That s the best way, Stremov put in.",
      "Stremov was a man of fifty, partly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but with a characteristic and intelligent face.",
      "Liza Merkalova was his wife s niece, and he spent all his leisure hours with her.",
      "On meeting Anna Karenina, as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch s enemy in the government, he tried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to be particularly cordial with her, the wife of his enemy.",
      "Nothing, he put in with a subtle smile, that s the very best way.",
      "I told you long ago, he said, turning to Liza Merkalova, that if you don t want to be bored, you mustn t think you re going to be bored.",
      "It s just as you mustn t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if you re afraid of sleeplessness.",
      "That s just what Anna Arkadyevna has just said.",
      "I should be very glad if I had said it, for it s not only clever but true, said Anna, smiling.",
      "No, do tell me why it is one can t go to sleep, and one can t help being bored?",
      "To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too.",
      "What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?",
      "And I can t and won t knowingly make a pretense about it.",
      "You re incorrigible, said Stremov, not looking at her, and he spoke again to Anna.",
      "As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but commonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of her, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that.",
      "Tushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet.",
      "No, don t go away, please don t, pleaded Liza Merkalova, hearing that Anna was going.",
      "Stremov joined in her entreaties.",
      "It s too violent a transition, he said, to go from such company to old Madame Vrede.",
      "And besides, you will only give her a chance for talking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind, he said to her.",
      "Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty.",
      "This shrewd man s flattering words, the na ve, childlike affection shown her by Liza Merkalova, and all the social atmosphere she was used to, it was all so easy, and what was in store for her was so difficult, that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation.",
      "But remembering what was in store for her alone at home, if she did not come to some decision, remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said good-bye and went away.",
      "Chapter 19 In spite of Vronsky s apparently frivolous life in society, he was a man who hated irregularity.",
      "In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again.",
      "In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he used about five times a year (more or less frequently, according to circumstances) to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape.",
      "This he used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.",
      "On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen coat, and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the table moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work.",
      "Petritsky, who knew he was ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way.",
      "Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is something exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is.",
      "So indeed it seemed to Vronsky.",
      "And not without inward pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult position.",
      "But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties.",
      "What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position.",
      "Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed, he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the sake of clearness.",
      "Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in before the New Year.",
      "Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky copied it, dividing it into three classes.",
      "In the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment s delay in paying.",
      "Such debts amounted to about four thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in Vronsky s presence.",
      "Vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and Yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.",
      "That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business, though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the swindler, and have no more words with him.",
      "And so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles.",
      "The second class eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts.",
      "These were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses, to the purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on.",
      "He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to be quite free from anxiety.",
      "The last class of debts to shops, to hotels, to his tailor were such as need not be considered.",
      "So that he needed at least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he only had one thousand eight hundred.",
      "For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky s income, such debts, one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand.",
      "His father s immense property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand, was left undivided between the brothers.",
      "At the time when the elder brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova, the daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father s estate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.",
      "Alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for him until he married, which he probably never would do.",
      "And his brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift.",
      "His mother, who had her own separate property, had allowed Alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had reserved, and Alexey had spent it all.",
      "Of late his mother, incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow, had given up sending him the money.",
      "And in consequence of this, Vronsky, who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand a year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found himself now in difficulties.",
      "To get out of these difficulties, he could not apply to his mother for money.",
      "Her last letter, which he had received the day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society.",
      "His mother s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever to her.",
      "But he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered, even though he felt now, vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame Karenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income.",
      "But it was impossible to draw back.",
      "He had only to recall his brother s wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful Varya sought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift.",
      "It was as impossible as beating a woman, stealing, or lying.",
      "One thing only could and ought to be done, and Vronsky determined upon it without an instant s hesitation: to borrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding which presented no difficulty, to cut down his expenses generally, and to sell his race horses.",
      "Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him.",
      "Then he sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay.",
      "Having finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother.",
      "Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna s, read them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the previous day, he sank into meditation.",
      "Chapter 20 Vronsky s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do.",
      "This code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never doubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that circle, had never had a moment s hesitation about doing what he ought to do.",
      "These principles laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a cardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie to a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but one may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may give one and so on.",
      "These principles were possibly not reasonable and not good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he adhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up.",
      "Only quite lately in regard to his relations with Anna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.",
      "His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple.",
      "It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided.",
      "She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he loved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife.",
      "He would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word, by a hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for.",
      "His attitude to society, too, was clear.",
      "Everyone might know, might suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it.",
      "If any did so, he was ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the non-existent honor of the woman he loved.",
      "His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all.",
      "From the moment that Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable.",
      "Her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person.",
      "No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?",
      "The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vronsky was prepared for this at any minute.",
      "But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness.",
      "Only the day before she had told him that she was with child.",
      "And he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life.",
      "And he had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband.",
      "He had said that, but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the same time, as he told himself so, he was afraid whether it was not wrong.",
      "If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her life with mine; am I prepared for that?",
      "How can I take her away now, when I have no money?",
      "Supposing I could arrange....",
      "But how can I take her away while I m in the service?",
      "If I say that I ought to be prepared to do it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.",
      "And he grew thoughtful.",
      "The question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life, of which none knew but he.",
      "Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream which he did not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love.",
      "His first steps in the world and in the service had been successful, but two years before he had made a great mistake.",
      "Anxious to show his independence and to advance, he had refused a post that had been offered him, hoping that this refusal would heighten his value; but it turned out that he had been too bold, and he was passed over.",
      "And having, whether he liked or not, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he carried it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any way, and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself.",
      "In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before, when he went away to Moscow.",
      "He felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything, but cared to do nothing, was already beginning to pall, that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward, good-natured fellow.",
      "His connection with Madame Karenina, by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention, had given him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while, but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force.",
      "The friend of his childhood, a man of the same set, of the same coterie, his comrade in the Corps of Pages, Serpuhovskoy, who had left school with him and had been his rival in class, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had come back a few days before from Central Asia, where he had gained two steps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young.",
      "As soon as he arrived in Petersburg, people began to talk about him as a newly risen star of the first magnitude.",
      "A schoolfellow of Vronsky s and of the same age, he was a general and was expecting a command, which might have influence on the course of political events; while Vronsky, independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman though he was, was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he liked.",
      "Of course I don t envy Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch one s opportunity, and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made.",
      "Three years ago he was in just the same position as I am.",
      "If I retire, I burn my ships.",
      "If I remain in the army, I lose nothing.",
      "She said herself she did not wish to change her position.",
      "And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy.",
      "And slowly twirling his mustaches, he got up from the table and walked about the room.",
      "His eyes shone particularly brightly, and he felt in that confident, calm, and happy frame of mind which always came after he had thoroughly faced his position.",
      "Everything was straight and clear, just as after former days of reckoning.",
      "He shaved, took a cold bath, dressed and went out.",
      "Chapter 21 We ve come to fetch you.",
      "Your _lessive_ lasted a good time today, said Petritsky.",
      "Well, is it over?",
      "It is over, answered Vronsky, smiling with his eyes only, and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over-bold or rapid movement might disturb it.",
      "You re always just as if you d come out of a bath after it, said Petritsky.",
      "I ve come from Gritsky s (that was what they called the colonel); they re expecting you.",
      "Vronsky, without answering, looked at his comrade, thinking of something else.",
      "Yes; is that music at his place?",
      "he said, listening to the familiar sounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him.",
      "What s the f te?",
      "Serpuhovskoy s come.",
      "said Vronsky, why, I didn t know.",
      "The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.",
      "Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love, that he sacrificed his ambition to it having anyway taken up this position, Vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt with him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment.",
      "Serpuhovskoy was a good friend, and he was delighted he had come.",
      "Ah, I m very glad!",
      "The colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house.",
      "The whole party were in the wide lower balcony.",
      "In the courtyard the first objects that met Vronsky s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats, standing near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers.",
      "He had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played Offenbach s quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side.",
      "A group of soldiers, a quartermaster, and several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky.",
      "The colonel returned to the table, went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in his hand, and proposed the toast, To the health of our former comrade, the gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy.",
      "Hurrah!",
      "The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps smiling, with a glass in his hand.",
      "You always get younger, Bondarenko, he said to the rosy-cheeked, smart-looking quartermaster standing just before him, still youngish looking though doing his second term of service.",
      "It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy.",
      "He looked more robust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful creature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their softness and nobility than their beauty.",
      "The only change Vronsky detected in him was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone.",
      "Vronsky knew that radiant air, and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy.",
      "As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky.",
      "A smile of pleasure lighted up his face.",
      "He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in his hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before the quartermaster, who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed.",
      "shouted the colonel.",
      "Yashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers.",
      "Serpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the gallant-looking quartermaster, and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief, went up to Vronsky.",
      "How glad I am!",
      "he said, squeezing his hand and drawing him on one side.",
      "You look after him, the colonel shouted to Yashvin, pointing to Vronsky; and he went down below to the soldiers.",
      "Why weren t you at the races yesterday?",
      "I expected to see you there, said Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy.",
      "I did go, but late.",
      "I beg your pardon, he added, and he turned to the adjutant: Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it runs to.",
      "And he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from his pocketbook, blushing a little.",
      "Have anything to eat or drink?",
      "Hi, something for the count to eat!",
      "Ah, here it is: have a glass!",
      "The f te at the colonel s lasted a long while.",
      "There was a great deal of drinking.",
      "They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again several times.",
      "Then they did the same to the colonel.",
      "Then, to the accompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky.",
      "Then the colonel, who began to show signs of feebleness, sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the superiority of Russia over Prussia, especially in cavalry attack, and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment.",
      "Serpuhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there; Vronsky was drenching his head with water.",
      "He had taken off his coat and put his sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and his head with his hands.",
      "When he had finished, Vronsky sat down by Serpuhovskoy.",
      "They both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them.",
      "I ve always been hearing about you through my wife, said Serpuhovskoy.",
      "I m glad you ve been seeing her pretty often.",
      "She s friendly with Varya, and they re the only women in Petersburg I care about seeing, answered Vronsky, smiling.",
      "He smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of it.",
      "The only ones?",
      "Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.",
      "Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife, said Vronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of face.",
      "I was greatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised.",
      "I expected even more.",
      "Serpuhovskoy smiled.",
      "Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it.",
      "Well, I on the contrary expected less I ll own frankly.",
      "But I m glad, very glad.",
      "I m ambitious; that s my weakness, and I confess to it.",
      "Perhaps you wouldn t confess to it if you hadn t been successful, said Vronsky.",
      "I don t suppose so, said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again.",
      "I won t say life wouldn t be worth living without it, but it would be dull.",
      "Of course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I ve chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to be, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know, said Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success; and so the nearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.",
      "Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone.",
      "I used to think so too, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.",
      "There it s out!",
      "here it comes!",
      "said Serpuhovskoy, laughing.",
      "Ever since I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I approved of what you did.",
      "But there are ways of doing everything.",
      "And I think your action was good in itself, but you didn t do it quite in the way you ought to have done.",
      "What s done can t be undone, and you know I never go back on what I ve done.",
      "And besides, I m very well off.",
      "Very well off for the time.",
      "But you re not satisfied with that.",
      "I wouldn t say this to your brother.",
      "He s a nice child, like our host here.",
      "There he goes!",
      "he added, listening to the roar of hurrah!",
      "and he s happy, but that does not satisfy you.",
      "I didn t say it did satisfy me.",
      "Yes, but that s not the only thing.",
      "Such men as you are wanted.",
      "By whom?",
      "By society, by Russia.",
      "Russia needs men; she needs a party, or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.",
      "Bertenev s party against the Russian communists?",
      "No, said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity.",
      "_Tout a est une blague_.",
      "That s always been and always will be.",
      "There are no communists.",
      "But intriguing people have to invent a noxious, dangerous party.",
      "It s an old trick.",
      "No, what s wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.",
      "But why so?",
      "Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power.",
      "Why aren t they independent men?",
      "Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an independent fortune; they ve not had a name, they ve not been close to the sun and center as we have.",
      "They can be bought either by money or by favor.",
      "And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy.",
      "And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don t believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income.",
      "_Cela n est pas plus fin que a_, when you get a peep at their cards.",
      "I may be inferior to them, stupider perhaps, though I don t see why I should be inferior to them.",
      "But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in being more difficult to buy.",
      "And such men are more needed than ever.",
      "Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his likes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment.",
      "Vronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in, through his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the world in which he moved.",
      "And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt envious.",
      "Still I haven t the one thing of most importance for that, he answered; I haven t the desire for power.",
      "I had it once, but it s gone.",
      "Excuse me, that s not true, said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.",
      "Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!",
      "Vronsky added, to be truthful.",
      "Yes, it s true now, that s another thing; but that _now_ won t last forever.",
      "Perhaps, answered Vronsky.",
      "You say _perhaps_, Serpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his thoughts, but I say _for certain_.",
      "And that s what I wanted to see you for.",
      "Your action was just what it should have been.",
      "I see that, but you ought not to keep it up.",
      "I only ask you to give me _carte blanche_.",
      "I m not going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn t I protect you?",
      "you ve protected me often enough!",
      "I should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing.",
      "Yes, he said, smiling to him as tenderly as a woman, give me _carte blanche_, retire from the regiment, and I ll draw you upwards imperceptibly.",
      "But you must understand that I want nothing, said Vronsky, except that all should be as it is.",
      "Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.",
      "You say that all should be as it is.",
      "I understand what that means.",
      "But listen: we re the same age, you ve known a greater number of women perhaps than I have.",
      "Serpohovskoy s smile and gestures told Vronsky that he mustn t be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place.",
      "But I m married, and believe me, in getting to know thoroughly one s wife, if one loves her, as someone has said, one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.",
      "We re coming directly!",
      "Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into the room and called them to the colonel.",
      "Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey would say to him.",
      "And here s my opinion for you.",
      "Women are the chief stumbling block in a man s career.",
      "It s hard to love a woman and do anything.",
      "There s only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance that s marriage.",
      "How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",
      "said Serpuhovskoy, who liked similes.",
      "Wait a minute, wait a minute!",
      "Yes, just as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your hands, when the _fardeau_ is tied on your back, and that s marriage.",
      "And that s what I felt when I was married.",
      "My hands were suddenly set free.",
      "But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing.",
      "Look at Mazankov, at Krupov.",
      "They ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.",
      "What women!",
      "said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.",
      "The firmer the woman s footing in society, the worse it is.",
      "That s much the same as not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms but tearing it away from someone else.",
      "You have never loved, Vronsky said softly, looking straight before him and thinking of Anna.",
      "Perhaps.",
      "But you remember what I ve said to you.",
      "And another thing, women are all more materialistic than men.",
      "We make something immense out of love, but they are always _terre- -terre_.",
      "Directly, directly!",
      "he cried to a footman who came in.",
      "But the footman had not come to call them again, as he supposed.",
      "The footman brought Vronsky a note.",
      "A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.",
      "Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.",
      "My head s begun to ache; I m going home, he said to Serpuhovskoy.",
      "Oh, good-bye then.",
      "You give me _carte blanche!_ We ll talk about it later on; I ll look you up in Petersburg.",
      "Chapter 22 It was six o clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and at the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to everyone, Vronsky got into Yashvin s hired fly, and told the driver to drive as quickly as possible.",
      "It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for four.",
      "He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out on the front seat, and sank into meditation.",
      "A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy, who had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the anticipation of the interview before him all blended into a general, joyous sense of life.",
      "This feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling.",
      "He dropped his legs, crossed one leg over the other knee, and taking it in his hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it had been grazed the day before by his fall, and leaning back he drew several deep breaths.",
      "I m happy, very happy!",
      "he said to himself.",
      "He had often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never felt so fond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment.",
      "He enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed.",
      "The bright, cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.",
      "The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air.",
      "Everything he saw from the carriage window, everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was as fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the carriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished.",
      "Get on, get on!",
      "he said to the driver, putting his head out of the window, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket he handed it to the man as he looked round.",
      "The driver s hand fumbled with something at the lamp, the whip cracked, and the carriage rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad.",
      "I want nothing, nothing but this happiness, he thought, staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows, and picturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time.",
      "And as I go on, I love her more and more.",
      "Here s the garden of the Vrede Villa.",
      "Whereabouts will she be?",
      "Where?",
      "How?",
      "Why did she fix on this place to meet me, and why does she write in Betsy s letter?",
      "he thought, wondering now for the first time at it.",
      "But there was now no time for wonder.",
      "He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and opening the door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went into the avenue that led up to the house.",
      "There was no one in the avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her.",
      "Her face was hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of the shoulders, and the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him.",
      "With fresh force, he felt conscious of himself from the springy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he breathed, and something set his lips twitching.",
      "Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly.",
      "You re not angry that I sent for you?",
      "I absolutely had to see you, she said; and the serious and set line of her lips, which he saw under the veil, transformed his mood at once.",
      "I angry!",
      "But how have you come, where from?",
      "Never mind, she said, laying her hand on his, come along, I must talk to you.",
      "He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be a joyous one.",
      "In her presence he had no will of his own: without knowing the grounds of her distress, he already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him.",
      "he asked her, squeezing her hand with his elbow, and trying to read her thoughts in her face.",
      "She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; then suddenly she stopped.",
      "I did not tell you yesterday, she began, breathing quickly and painfully, that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him everything.",
      "He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her.",
      "But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a proud and hard expression came over his face.",
      "Yes, yes, that s better, a thousand times better!",
      "I know how painful it was, he said.",
      "But she was not listening to his words, she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face.",
      "She could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to Vronsky that a duel was now inevitable.",
      "The idea of a duel had never crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness.",
      "When she got her husband s letter, she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son, and to join her lover.",
      "The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya s had confirmed her still more in this.",
      "But this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her.",
      "She hoped that this interview would transform her position, and save her.",
      "If on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely, passionately, without an instant s wavering: Throw up everything and come with me!",
      "she would give up her son and go away with him.",
      "But this news had not produced what she had expected in him; he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.",
      "It was not in the least painful to me.",
      "It happened of itself, she said irritably; and see.... she pulled her husband s letter out of her glove.",
      "I understand, I understand, he interrupted her, taking the letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her.",
      "The one thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as to devote my life to your happiness.",
      "Why do you tell me that?",
      "Do you suppose I can doubt it?",
      "If I doubted.... Who s that coming?",
      "said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies walking towards them.",
      "Perhaps they know us!",
      "and he hurriedly turned off, drawing her after him into a side path.",
      "Her lips were quivering.",
      "And he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil.",
      "I tell you that s not the point I can t doubt that; but see what he writes to me.",
      "Read it.",
      "She stood still again.",
      "Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the betrayed husband.",
      "Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could not help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured husband s shot, after having himself fired into the air.",
      "And at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.",
      "Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no determination in them.",
      "She saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself.",
      "She knew that whatever he might say to her, he would not say all he thought.",
      "And she knew that her last hope had failed her.",
      "This was not what she had been reckoning on.",
      "You see the sort of man he is, she said, with a shaking voice; he.... Forgive me, but I rejoice at it, Vronsky interrupted.",
      "For God s sake, let me finish!",
      "he added, his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words.",
      "I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes.",
      "Why can t they?",
      "Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said.",
      "She felt that her fate was sealed.",
      "Vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable, he thought things could not go on as before, but he said something different.",
      "It can t go on.",
      "I hope that now you will leave him.",
      "I hope he was confused, and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life.",
      "Tomorrow.... he was beginning.",
      "She did not let him go on.",
      "But my child!",
      "she shrieked.",
      "You see what he writes!",
      "I should have to leave him, and I can t and won t do that.",
      "But, for God s sake, which is better?",
      "leave your child, or keep up this degrading position?",
      "To whom is it degrading?",
      "To all, and most of all to you.",
      "You say degrading ... don t say that.",
      "Those words have no meaning for me, she said in a shaking voice.",
      "She did not want him now to say what was untrue.",
      "She had nothing left her but his love, and she wanted to love him.",
      "Don t you understand that from the day I loved you everything has changed for me?",
      "For me there is one thing, and one thing only your love.",
      "If that s mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that nothing can be humiliating to me.",
      "I am proud of my position, because ... proud of being ... proud.... She could not say what she was proud of.",
      "Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance.",
      "She stood still and sobbed.",
      "He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping.",
      "He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so.",
      "He felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done something wrong.",
      "Is not a divorce possible?",
      "he said feebly.",
      "She shook her head, not answering.",
      "Couldn t you take your son, and still leave him?",
      "Yes; but it all depends on him.",
      "Now I must go to him, she said shortly.",
      "Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her.",
      "On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.",
      "Yes, she said.",
      "But don t let us talk any more of it.",
      "Anna s carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come back to the little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up.",
      "Anna said good-bye to Vronsky, and drove home.",
      "Chapter 23 On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of June.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was held, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in his place, putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him.",
      "Among these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make.",
      "But he did not really need these documents.",
      "He remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say.",
      "He knew that when the time came, and when he saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now.",
      "He felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight.",
      "Meantime, as he listened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and inoffensive air.",
      "No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the members shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to call for order.",
      "When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch announced in his subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the Reorganization of the Native Tribes.",
      "All attention was turned upon him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat, and not looking at his opponent, but selecting, as he always did while he was delivering his speeches, the first person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little old man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began to expound his views.",
      "When he reached the point about the fundamental and radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest.",
      "Stremov, who was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick, began defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his motion was carried, three new commissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s success had been even greater than he had anticipated.",
      "Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not help smiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the chief secretary of his department, anxious to flatter him, informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the Commission.",
      "Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him for the return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival.",
      "Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so Alexey Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival.",
      "But when she arrived, he did not meet her.",
      "She was told that he had not yet gone out, but was busy with his secretary.",
      "She sent word to her husband that she had come, went to her own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her things, expecting he would come to her.",
      "But an hour passed; he did not come.",
      "She went into the dining-room on the pretext of giving some directions, and spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out there; but he did not come, though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the chief secretary.",
      "She knew that he usually went out quickly to his office, and she wanted to see him before that, so that their attitude to one another might be defined.",
      "She walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him.",
      "When she went into his study he was in official uniform, obviously ready to go out, sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows, looking dejectedly before him.",
      "She saw him before he saw her, and she saw that he was thinking of her.",
      "On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then his face flushed hotly a thing Anna had never seen before, and he got up quickly and went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, but above them at her forehead and hair.",
      "He went up to her, took her by the hand, and asked her to sit down.",
      "I am very glad you have come, he said, sitting down beside her, and obviously wishing to say something, he stuttered.",
      "Several times he tried to begin to speak, but stopped.",
      "In spite of the fact that, preparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself to despise and reproach him, she did not know what to say to him, and she felt sorry for him.",
      "And so the silence lasted for some time.",
      "he said, and not waiting for an answer, he added: I shan t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.",
      "I had thought of going to Moscow, she said.",
      "No, you did quite, quite right to come, he said, and was silent again.",
      "Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began herself.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, she said, looking at him and not dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair, I m a guilty woman, I m a bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have come to tell you that I can change nothing.",
      "I have asked you no question about that, he said, all at once, resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face; that was as I had supposed.",
      "Under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties.",
      "But as I told you then, and have written to you, he said in a thin, shrill voice, I repeat now, that I am not bound to know this.",
      "I ignore it.",
      "Not all wives are so kind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands.",
      "He laid special emphasis on the word agreeable.",
      "I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as my name is not disgraced.",
      "And so I simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor.",
      "But our relations cannot be the same as always, Anna began in a timid voice, looking at him with dismay.",
      "When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill, childish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position.",
      "I cannot be your wife while I.... she began.",
      "He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.",
      "The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your ideas.",
      "I have too much respect or contempt, or both ...",
      "I respect your past and despise your present ... that I was far from the interpretation you put on my words.",
      "Anna sighed and bowed her head.",
      "Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you show, he went on, getting hot, announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently you can see anything reprehensible in performing a wife s duties in relation to your husband.",
      "What is it you want of me?",
      "I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.",
      "That s not much, I think.",
      "And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties.",
      "That s all I have to say to you.",
      "Now it s time for me to go.",
      "I m not dining at home.",
      "He got up and moved towards the door.",
      "Anna got up too.",
      "Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.",
      "Chapter 24 The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for him.",
      "The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and had lost all attraction for him.",
      "In spite of the magnificent harvest, never had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year, and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him.",
      "The delight he had experienced in the work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants, the envy he felt of them, of their life, the desire to adopt that life, which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention, the execution of which he had thought out in detail all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it, that he could not take his former interest in it, and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all.",
      "The herd of improved cows such as Pava, the whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields surrounded with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured, the seed sown in drills, and all the rest of it it was all splendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for themselves and comrades people in sympathy with them.",
      "But he saw clearly now (his work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him in this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers, in which there was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side, the natural order of things.",
      "And in this struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side, and with no effort or even intention on the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone.",
      "Worst of all, the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted.",
      "He could not help feeling now, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him, that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one.",
      "In reality, what was the struggle about?",
      "He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and he could not help it, for he had only to relax his efforts, and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers wages), while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably, that is to say, as they were used to doing it.",
      "It was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him, so as to try not to break the winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that he should attend to what he was doing.",
      "What the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly and heedlessly, without thinking.",
      "That summer Levin saw this at every step.",
      "He sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover, justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to, and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow.",
      "He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him.",
      "And he was told, Don t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough.",
      "The ploughs were practically useless, because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the plough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses and tore up the ground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it.",
      "The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary, the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after working all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault, saying, Do what you will to me, your honor.",
      "They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told him, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days.",
      "All this happened, not because anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he knew that they liked him, thought him a simple gentleman (their highest praise); but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly, and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed to their most just claims.",
      "Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land.",
      "He saw where his boat leaked, but he did not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving himself.",
      "(Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it.)",
      "But now he could deceive himself no longer.",
      "The farming of the land, as he was managing it, had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him, and he could take no further interest in it.",
      "To this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to come; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who would, so she gave him to understand, accept him now.",
      "Levin himself had felt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love her; but he could not go over to the Oblonskys , knowing she was there.",
      "The fact that he had made her an offer, and she had refused him, had placed an insuperable barrier between her and him.",
      "I can t ask her to be my wife merely because she can t be the wife of the man she wanted to marry, he said to himself.",
      "The thought of this made him cold and hostile to her.",
      "I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will only hate me all the more, as she s bound to.",
      "And besides, how can I now, after what Darya Alexandrovna told me, go to see them?",
      "Can I help showing that I know what she told me?",
      "And me to go magnanimously to forgive her, and have pity on her!",
      "Me go through a performance before her of forgiving, and deigning to bestow my love on her!...",
      "What induced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that?",
      "By chance I might have seen her, then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it s out of the question, out of the question!",
      "Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for Kitty s use.",
      "I m told you have a side-saddle, she wrote to him; I hope you will bring it over yourself.",
      "This was more than he could stand.",
      "How could a woman of any intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating position!",
      "He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle without any reply.",
      "To write that he would go was impossible, because he could not go; to write that he could not come because something prevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse.",
      "He sent the saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something shameful; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his neighborhood, and had lately written to ask him to keep a long-standing promise to stay with him.",
      "The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district, had long tempted Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate.",
      "Now he was glad to get away from the neighborhood of the Shtcherbatskys, and still more from his farm work, especially on a shooting expedition, which always in trouble served as the best consolation.",
      "Chapter 25 In the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post horses, and Levin drove there with his own horses in his big, old-fashioned carriage.",
      "He stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant s to feed his horses.",
      "A bald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his cheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass.",
      "Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big, clean, tidy yard, with charred, old-fashioned ploughs in it, the old man asked Levin to come into the parlor.",
      "A cleanly dressed young woman, with clogs on her bare feet, was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room.",
      "She was frightened of the dog, that ran in after Levin, and uttered a shriek, but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her.",
      "Pointing Levin with her bare arm to the door into the parlor, she bent down again, hiding her handsome face, and went on scrubbing.",
      "Would you like the samovar?",
      "Yes, please.",
      "The parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it into two.",
      "Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns, a bench, and two chairs.",
      "Near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery.",
      "The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and it was so clean that Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles, should not muddy the floor, and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door.",
      "After looking round the parlor, Levin went out in the back yard.",
      "The good-looking young woman in clogs, swinging the empty pails on the yoke, ran on before him to the well for water.",
      "Look sharp, my girl!",
      "the old man shouted after her, good-humoredly, and he went up to Levin.",
      "Well, sir, are you going to Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky?",
      "His honor comes to us too, he began, chatting, leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps.",
      "In the middle of the old man s account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates creaked again, and laborers came into the yard from the fields, with wooden ploughs and harrows.",
      "The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows were sleek and fat.",
      "The laborers were obviously of the household: two were young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts, one an old man, the other a young fellow.",
      "Moving off from the steps, the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them.",
      "What have they been ploughing?",
      "Ploughing up the potatoes.",
      "We rent a bit of land too.",
      "Fedot, don t let out the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we ll put the other in harness.",
      "Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he brought them along?",
      "asked the big, healthy-looking fellow, obviously the old man s son.",
      "There ... in the outer room, answered the old man, bundling together the harness he had taken off, and flinging it on the ground.",
      "You can put them on, while they have dinner.",
      "The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders.",
      "More women came on the scene from somewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, with children and without children.",
      "The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, having disposed of the horses, came in to dinner.",
      "Levin, getting his provisions out of his carriage, invited the old man to take tea with him.",
      "Well, I have had some today already, said the old man, obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure.",
      "But just a glass for company.",
      "Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man s farming.",
      "Ten years before, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who owned them, and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner.",
      "A small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent, while a hundred acres of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers.",
      "The old man complained that things were doing badly.",
      "But Levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a flourishing condition.",
      "If it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he would not have married his three sons and a nephew, he would not have rebuilt twice after fires, and each time on a larger scale.",
      "In spite of the old man s complaints, it was evident that he was proud, and justly proud, of his prosperity, proud of his sons, his nephew, his sons wives, his horses and his cows, and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going.",
      "From his conversation with the old man, Levin thought he was not averse to new methods either.",
      "He had planted a great many potatoes, and his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were already past flowering and beginning to die down, while Levin s were only just coming into flower.",
      "He earthed up his potatoes with a modern plough borrowed from a neighboring landowner.",
      "He sowed wheat.",
      "The trifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses, specially struck Levin.",
      "How many times had Levin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get it saved; but always it had turned out to be impossible.",
      "The peasant got this done, and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts.",
      "What have the wenches to do?",
      "They carry it out in bundles to the roadside, and the cart brings it away.",
      "Well, we landowners can t manage well with our laborers, said Levin, handing him a glass of tea.",
      "Thank you, said the old man, and he took the glass, but refused sugar, pointing to a lump he had left.",
      "They re simple destruction, said he.",
      "Look at Sviazhsky s, for instance.",
      "We know what the land s like first-rate, yet there s not much of a crop to boast of.",
      "It s not looked after enough that s all it is!",
      "But you work your land with hired laborers?",
      "We re all peasants together.",
      "We go into everything ourselves.",
      "If a man s no use, he can go, and we can manage by ourselves.",
      "Father, Finogen wants some tar, said the young woman in the clogs, coming in.",
      "Yes, yes, that s how it is, sir!",
      "said the old man, getting up, and crossing himself deliberately, he thanked Levin and went out.",
      "When Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family at dinner.",
      "The women were standing up waiting on them.",
      "The young, sturdy-looking son was telling something funny with his mouth full of pudding, and they were all laughing, the woman in the clogs, who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl, laughing most merrily of all.",
      "Very probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant household made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that Levin could never get rid of it.",
      "And all the way from the old peasant s to Sviazhsky s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression that demanded his special attention.",
      "Chapter 26 Sviazhsky was the marshal of his district.",
      "He was five years older than Levin, and had long been married.",
      "His sister-in-law, a young girl Levin liked very much, lived in his house; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him.",
      "He knew this with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it, though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone; and he knew too that, although he wanted to get married, and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife, he could no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, than he could have flown up to the sky.",
      "And this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to Sviazhsky.",
      "On getting Sviazhsky s letter with the invitation for shooting, Levin had immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his mind that Sviazhsky s having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition, and so he would go, all the same.",
      "Besides, at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself, put himself to the test in regard to this girl.",
      "The Sviazhskys home-life was exceedingly pleasant, and Sviazhsky himself, the best type of man taking part in local affairs that Levin knew, was very interesting to him.",
      "Sviazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder to Levin, whose convictions, very logical though never original, go one way by themselves, while their life, exceedingly definite and firm in its direction, goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions.",
      "Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced man.",
      "He despised the nobility, and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom, and only concealing their views from cowardice.",
      "He regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the style of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and when he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the red band.",
      "He considered human life only tolerable abroad, and went abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in Russia.",
      "He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at the same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion.",
      "He believed neither in God nor the devil, but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village.",
      "On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor.",
      "But he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged his wife s life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband s efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible.",
      "If it had not been a characteristic of Levin s to put the most favorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky s character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to himself, a fool or a knave, and everything would have seemed clear.",
      "But he could not say a fool, because Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever, and moreover, a highly cultivated man, who was exceptionally modest over his culture.",
      "There was not a subject he knew nothing of.",
      "But he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so.",
      "Still less could Levin say that he was a knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest, good-hearted, sensible man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly, and perseveringly at his work; he was held in high honor by everyone about him, and certainly he had never consciously done, and was indeed incapable of doing, anything base.",
      "Levin tried to understand him, and could not understand him, and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma.",
      "Levin and he were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture to sound Sviazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life; but it was always in vain.",
      "Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky s mind, which were hospitably open to all, he noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted; faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes, as though he were afraid Levin would understand him, and he would give him a kindly, good-humored repulse.",
      "Just now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly glad to stay with Sviazhsky.",
      "Apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone else, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on Levin, he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness, definiteness, and good courage in life.",
      "Moreover, Levin knew that at Sviazhsky s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops, laborers wages, and so on, which, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low, but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance.",
      "It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom, and it may not be of importance in England.",
      "In both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now, when everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking shape, the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in Russia, thought Levin.",
      "The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected.",
      "The marsh was dry and there were no grouse at all.",
      "He walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds, but to make up for that he brought back, as he always did from shooting, an excellent appetite, excellent spirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion.",
      "And while out shooting, when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all, suddenly the old man and his family kept coming back to his mind, and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention, but the solution of some question connected with them.",
      "In the evening at tea, two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party, and the interesting conversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.",
      "Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table, and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister, who was sitting opposite him.",
      "Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced, fair-haired, rather short woman, all smiles and dimples.",
      "Levin tried through her to get a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind; but he had not complete freedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of embarrassment.",
      "This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister-in-law was sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put on, as he fancied, for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape of a trapeze, on her white bosom.",
      "This quadrangular opening, in spite of the bosom s being very white, or just because it was very white, deprived Levin of the full use of his faculties.",
      "He imagined, probably mistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his account, and felt that he had no right to look at it, and tried not to look at it; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the low-necked bodice having been made.",
      "It seemed to Levin that he had deceived someone, that he ought to explain something, but that to explain it was impossible, and for that reason he was continually blushing, was ill at ease and awkward.",
      "His awkwardness infected the pretty sister-in-law too.",
      "But their hostess appeared not to observe this, and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation.",
      "You say, she said, pursuing the subject that had been started, that my husband cannot be interested in what s Russian.",
      "It s quite the contrary; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad, but not as he is here.",
      "Here, he feels in his proper place.",
      "He has so much to do, and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything.",
      "Oh, you ve not been to see our school, have you?",
      "I ve seen it....",
      "The little house covered with ivy, isn t it?",
      "Yes; that s Nastia s work, she said, indicating her sister.",
      "You teach in it yourself?",
      "asked Levin, trying to look above the open neck, but feeling that wherever he looked in that direction he should see it.",
      "Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we have a first-rate schoolmistress now.",
      "And we ve started gymnastic exercises.",
      "No, thank you, I won t have any more tea, said Levin, and conscious of doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing the conversation, he got up, blushing.",
      "I hear a very interesting conversation, he added, and walked to the other end of the table, where Sviazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood.",
      "Sviazhsky was sitting sideways, with one elbow on the table, and a cup in one hand, while with the other hand he gathered up his beard, held it to his nose and let it drop again, as though he were smelling it.",
      "His brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whiskers, and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks.",
      "The gentleman was complaining of the peasants.",
      "It was evident to Levin that Sviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman s complaints, which would at once demolish his whole contention, but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer, and listened, not without pleasure, to the landowner s comic speeches.",
      "The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his life in the country.",
      "Levin saw proofs of this in his dress, in the old-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his everyday attire, in his shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his idiomatic, fluent Russian, in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use, and in the resolute gestures of his large, red, sunburnt hands, with an old betrothal ring on the little finger.",
      "Chapter 27 If I d only the heart to throw up what s been set going ... such a lot of trouble wasted ...",
      "I d turn my back on the whole business, sell up, go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _La Belle H l ne_, said the landowner, a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face.",
      "But you see you don t throw it up, said Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky; so there must be something gained.",
      "The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor hired.",
      "Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense.",
      "Though, instead of that, you d never believe it the drunkenness, the immorality!",
      "They keep chopping and changing their bits of land.",
      "Not a sight of a horse or a cow.",
      "The peasant s dying of hunger, but just go and take him on as a laborer, he ll do his best to do you a mischief, and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.",
      "But then you make complaints to the justice too, said Sviazhsky.",
      "I lodge complaints?",
      "Not for anything in the world!",
      "Such a talking, and such a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it.",
      "At the works, for instance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off.",
      "What did the justice do?",
      "Why, acquitted them.",
      "Nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder.",
      "He ll flog them in the good old style!",
      "But for that there d be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away.",
      "Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, far from resenting it, was apparently amused by it.",
      "But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures, said he, smiling: Levin and I and this gentleman.",
      "He indicated the other landowner.",
      "Yes, the thing s done at Mihail Petrovitch s, but ask him how it s done.",
      "Do you call that a rational system?",
      "said the landowner, obviously rather proud of the word rational.",
      "My system s very simple, said Mihail Petrovitch, thank God.",
      "All my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and the peasants come to me, Father, master, help us!",
      "Well, the peasants are all one s neighbors; one feels for them.",
      "So one advances them a third, but one says: Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must help me when I need it whether it s the sowing of the oats, or the haycutting, or the harvest ; and well, one agrees, so much for each taxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too, it s true.",
      "Levin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods, exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch, turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.",
      "Then what do you think?",
      "he asked; what system is one to adopt nowadays?",
      "Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants; that one can do only that s just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined.",
      "Where the land with serf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one, on the half-crop system it yields three to one.",
      "Russia has been ruined by the emancipation!",
      "Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin, and even made a faint gesture of irony to him; but Levin did not think the landowner s words absurd, he understood them better than he did Sviazhsky.",
      "A great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true, new to him, and quite incontestable.",
      "The landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought a thing that very rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain, but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life, which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village, and had considered in every aspect.",
      "The point is, don t you see, that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority, he said, evidently wishing to show he was not without culture.",
      "Take the reforms of Peter, of Catherine, of Alexander.",
      "Take European history.",
      "And progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato, for instance, that was introduced among us by force.",
      "The wooden plough too wasn t always used.",
      "It was introduced maybe in the days before the Empire, but it was probably brought in by force.",
      "Now, in our own day, we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing machines, and carting manure and all the modern implements all that we brought into use by our authority, and the peasants opposed it at first, and ended by imitating us.",
      "Now, by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry, where it had been raised to a high level, is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition.",
      "That s how I see it.",
      "If it s rational, you ll be able to keep up the same system with hired labor, said Sviazhsky.",
      "We ve no power over them.",
      "With whom am I going to work the system, allow me to ask?",
      "There it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture, thought Levin.",
      "With laborers.",
      "The laborers won t work well, and won t work with good implements.",
      "Our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig, and when he s drunk he ruins everything you give him.",
      "He makes the horses ill with too much water, cuts good harness, barters the tires of the wheels for drink, drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so as to break it.",
      "He loathes the sight of anything that s not after his fashion.",
      "And that s how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.",
      "Lands gone out of cultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the wealth of the country has decreased.",
      "If the same thing had been done, but with care that.... And he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided.",
      "This did not interest Levin, but when he had finished, Levin went back to his first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion: That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit that s perfectly true, said he.",
      "I don t believe it, Sviazhsky replied quite seriously; all I see is that we don t know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low.",
      "We have no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don t even know how to keep accounts.",
      "Ask any landowner; he won t be able to tell you what crop s profitable, and what s not.",
      "Italian bookkeeping, said the gentleman of the gray whiskers ironically.",
      "You may keep your books as you like, but if they spoil everything for you, there won t be any profit.",
      "Why do they spoil things?",
      "A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian presser, they will break, but my steam press they don t break.",
      "A wretched Russian nag they ll ruin, but keep good dray-horses they won t ruin them.",
      "And so it is all round.",
      "We must raise our farming to a higher level.",
      "Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch!",
      "It s all very well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the university, lads to be educated at the high school how am I going to buy these dray-horses?",
      "Well, that s what the land banks are for.",
      "To get what s left me sold by auction?",
      "I don t agree that it s necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher, said Levin.",
      "I devote myself to it, and I have means, but I can do nothing.",
      "As to the banks, I don t know to whom they re any good.",
      "For my part, anyway, whatever I ve spent money on in the way of husbandry, it has been a loss: stock a loss, machinery a loss.",
      "That s true enough, the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in, positively laughing with satisfaction.",
      "And I m not the only one, pursued Levin.",
      "I mix with all the neighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss.",
      "Come, tell us how does your land do does it pay?",
      "said Levin, and at once in Sviazhsky s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky s mind.",
      "Moreover, this question on Levin s part was not quite in good faith.",
      "Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles.",
      "She did not remember the precise sum, but it appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a farthing.",
      "The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky s farming, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making.",
      "Possibly it does not pay, answered Sviazhsky.",
      "That merely proves either that I m a bad manager, or that I ve sunk my capital for the increase of my rents.",
      "Oh, rent!",
      "Rent there may be in Europe, where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words they re working it out; so there s no question of rent.",
      "How no rent?",
      "It s a law.",
      "Then we re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply muddles us.",
      "No, tell me how there can be a theory of rent?...",
      "Will you have some junket?",
      "Masha, pass us some junket or raspberries.",
      "He turned to his wife.",
      "Extraordinarily late the raspberries are lasting this year.",
      "And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off, apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.",
      "Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don t find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all men who think independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any other person s idea, and particularly partial to his own.",
      "He stuck to it that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority, and there is none; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air.",
      "What makes you think, said Levin, trying to get back to the question, that it s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive?",
      "That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we ve no power over them, answered the landowner.",
      "How can new conditions be found?",
      "said Sviazhsky.",
      "Having eaten some junket and lighted a cigarette, he came back to the discussion.",
      "All possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied, he said.",
      "The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each guarantee for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed and ready made, and must be adopted.",
      "Permanent hands, day-laborers, rammers you can t get out of those forms.",
      "But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.",
      "Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones.",
      "And will find them, in all probability.",
      "That s just what I was meaning, answered Levin.",
      "Why shouldn t we seek them for ourselves?",
      "Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways.",
      "They are ready, invented.",
      "But if they don t do for us, if they re stupid?",
      "And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.",
      "Oh, yes; we ll bury the world under our caps!",
      "We ve found the secret Europe was seeking for!",
      "I ve heard all that; but, excuse me, do you know all that s been done in Europe on the question of the organization of labor?",
      "No, very little.",
      "That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe.",
      "The Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of the labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the Mulhausen experiment?",
      "That s a fact by now, as you re probably aware.",
      "I have some idea of it, but very vague.",
      "No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do.",
      "I m not a professor of sociology, of course, but it interested me, and really, if it interests you, you ought to study it.",
      "But what conclusion have they come to?",
      "Excuse me....",
      "The two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind, went to see his guests out.",
      "Chapter 28 Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia; that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work, as with the peasant he had met half-way to the Sviazhskys , was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved.",
      "And it seemed to him that the problem could be solved, and that he ought to try and solve it.",
      "After saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole of the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going to bed, into his host s study to get the books on the labor question that Sviazhsky had offered him.",
      "Sviazhsky s study was a huge room, surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing-table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a round table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp.",
      "On the writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering, and full of papers of various sorts.",
      "Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.",
      "What are you looking at there?",
      "he said to Levin, who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews.",
      "Oh, yes, there s a very interesting article here, said Sviazhsky of the review Levin was holding in his hand.",
      "It appears, he went on, with eager interest, that Friedrich was not, after all, the person chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland.",
      "It is proved.... And with his characteristic clearness, he summed up those new, very important, and interesting revelations.",
      "Although Levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land, he wondered, as he heard Sviazhsky: What is there inside of him?",
      "And why, why is he interested in the partition of Poland?",
      "When Sviazhsky had finished, Levin could not help asking: Well, and what then?",
      "But there was nothing to follow.",
      "It was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so.",
      "But Sviazhsky did not explain, and saw no need to explain why it was interesting to him.",
      "Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor, said Levin, sighing.",
      "He s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.",
      "Oh, get along with you!",
      "An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart, like all of them!",
      "Whose marshal you are.",
      "Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction, said Sviazhsky, laughing.",
      "I ll tell you what interests me very much, said Levin.",
      "He s right that our system, that s to say of rational farming, doesn t answer, that the only thing that answers is the money-lender system, like that meek-looking gentleman s, or else the very simplest.... Whose fault is it?",
      "Our own, of course.",
      "Besides, it s not true that it doesn t answer.",
      "It answers with Vassiltchikov.",
      "A factory....",
      "But I really don t know what it is you are surprised at.",
      "The people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development, that it s obvious they re bound to oppose everything that s strange to them.",
      "In Europe, a rational system answers because the people are educated; it follows that we must educate the people that s all.",
      "But how are we to educate the people?",
      "To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and schools, and schools.",
      "But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development: what help are schools for that?",
      "Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man You should try purgative medicine.",
      "Taken: worse.",
      "Try leeches.",
      "Tried them: worse.",
      "Well, then, there s nothing left but to pray to God.",
      "Tried it: worse.",
      "That s just how it is with us.",
      "I say political economy; you say worse.",
      "I say socialism: worse.",
      "Education: worse.",
      "But how do schools help matters?",
      "They give the peasant fresh wants.",
      "Well, that s a thing I ve never understood, Levin replied with heat.",
      "In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position?",
      "You say schools, education, will give them fresh wants.",
      "So much the worse, since they won t be capable of satisfying them.",
      "And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition, I never could make out.",
      "The day before yesterday, I met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby, and asked her where she was going.",
      "She said she was going to the wise woman; her boy had screaming fits, so she was taking him to be doctored.",
      "I asked, Why, how does the wise woman cure screaming fits?",
      "She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some charm.... Well, you re saying it yourself!",
      "What s wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just.... Sviazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly.",
      "said Levin with annoyance; that method of doctoring I merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools.",
      "The people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams.",
      "But in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen-roost affects the screaming.",
      "What has to be cured is what makes him poor.",
      "Well, in that, at least, you re in agreement with Spencer, whom you dislike so much.",
      "He says, too, that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing, as he says, but not of being able to read and write.... Well, then, I m very glad or the contrary, very sorry, that I m in agreement with Spencer; only I ve known it a long while.",
      "Schools can do no good; what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will become richer, will have more leisure and then there will be schools.",
      "Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.",
      "And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?",
      "But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky s eyes, and he said smiling: No; that screaming story is positively capital!",
      "Did you really hear it yourself?",
      "Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man s life and his thoughts.",
      "Obviously he did not care in the least what his reasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of reasoning.",
      "And he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a blind alley.",
      "That was the only thing he disliked, and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.",
      "All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by the old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of all the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent excitement.",
      "This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply for social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden from Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he guided public opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country gentleman, perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life, but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class, and that the best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation of some solution near at hand.",
      "Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg, Levin did not fall asleep for a long while.",
      "Not one conversation with Sviazhsky, though he had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin; but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.",
      "Levin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in imagination amending his own replies.",
      "Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be forced on him by authority.",
      "If no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements, you would be quite right.",
      "But the only system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with his habits, just as on the old peasant s land half-way here.",
      "Your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers.",
      "We have gone our way the European way a long while, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.",
      "Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but as the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that.",
      "Imagine, I ought to have said to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting the soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before.",
      "Divide it in halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will be greater, and the share of labor will be greater too.",
      "And to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success.",
      "How to do this?",
      "that s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be done.",
      "This idea threw Levin into a great excitement.",
      "He did not sleep half the night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice.",
      "He had not intended to go away next day, but he now determined to go home early in the morning.",
      "Besides, the sister-in-law with her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action.",
      "Most important of all he must get back without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis.",
      "He had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system.",
      "Chapter 29 The carrying out of Levin s plan presented many difficulties; but he struggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, though not what he desired, was enough to enable him, without self-deception, to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble.",
      "One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.",
      "When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless.",
      "The bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago, but no heed had been paid him.",
      "But as for the proposal made by Levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second ploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it.",
      "On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme.",
      "The simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp Levin s proposal that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle-yard and he was in complete sympathy with the plan.",
      "But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, Ivan s face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say, and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens, or ran to get water or to clear out the dung.",
      "Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them.",
      "They were firmly convinced that his real aim (whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say to them.",
      "And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great deal but never said what was their real object.",
      "Moreover (Levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to use new implements.",
      "They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better, that the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give up improved methods, the advantages of which were so obvious.",
      "But in spite of all these difficulties he got his way, and by autumn the system was working, or at least so it seemed to him.",
      "At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible, and determined to divide it up.",
      "The cattle-yard, the garden, hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to be made into separate lots.",
      "The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin fancied, understood the matter better than any of them, collecting together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his own family, became a partner in the cattle-yard.",
      "A distant part of the estate, a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was with the help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant Shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms.",
      "The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system, but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization of the whole, and they completely took up Levin s time.",
      "It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits.",
      "It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov s company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short.",
      "It is true that the peasants of the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but as rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov himself said to Levin, If you would take a rent for the land, it would save you trouble, and we should be more free.",
      "Moreover the same peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it till the winter.",
      "It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants.",
      "He evidently quite misunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, the conditions upon which the land had been given to him.",
      "Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he might say, not to let themselves be taken in.",
      "He felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the gleam in Ryezunov s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if anyone were to be taken in, it would not be he, Ryezunov.",
      "But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.",
      "These matters, together with the management of the land still left on his hands, and the indoor work over his book, so engrossed Levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting.",
      "At the end of August he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow, from their servant who brought back the side-saddle.",
      "He felt that in not answering Darya Alexandrovna s letter he had by his rudeness, of which he could not think without a flush of shame, burned his ships, and that he would never go and see them again.",
      "He had been just as rude with the Sviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye.",
      "But he would never go to see them again either.",
      "He did not care about that now.",
      "The business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life.",
      "He read the books lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he had anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken.",
      "In the books on political economy in Mill, for instance, whom he studied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these laws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general.",
      "He saw just the same thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student, or they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia had nothing in common.",
      "Political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were universal and unvarying.",
      "Socialism told him that development along these lines leads to ruin.",
      "And neither of them gave an answer, or even a hint, in reply to the question what he, Levin, and all the Russian peasants and landowners, were to do with their millions of hands and millions of acres, to make them as productive as possible for the common weal.",
      "Having once taken the subject up, he read conscientiously everything bearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot, in order that he might not on this question be confronted with what so often met him on various subjects.",
      "Often, just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was talking to, and was beginning to explain his own, he would suddenly be told: But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli?",
      "You haven t read them: they ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.",
      "He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell him.",
      "He knew what he wanted.",
      "He saw that Russia has splendid land, splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant s on the way to Sviazhsky s, the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the European way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable, and has its roots in the national spirit.",
      "He thought that the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was occupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed.",
      "And he wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land.",
      "Chapter 30 At the end of September the timber had been carted for building the cattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided.",
      "In practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, so it seemed to Levin.",
      "In order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book, which, in Levin s daydreams, was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy, but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil, all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad, and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction, and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted.",
      "Levin was only waiting for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad.",
      "But the rains began, preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the delivery of the wheat.",
      "The mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away, and the weather got worse and worse.",
      "On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and hoping for fine weather, Levin began making final preparations for his journey.",
      "He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him, and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off.",
      "Having finished all his business, soaked through with the streams of water which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his gaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned homewards in the evening.",
      "The weather had become worse than ever towards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right under his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm-tree.",
      "In spite of the gloominess of nature around him, he felt peculiarly eager.",
      "The talks he had been having with the peasants in the further village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position.",
      "The old servant to whose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin s plan, and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase of cattle.",
      "I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my end, thought Levin; and it s something to work and take trouble for.",
      "This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public welfare comes into it.",
      "The whole system of culture, the chief element in the condition of the people, must be completely transformed.",
      "Instead of poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility, harmony and unity of interests.",
      "In short, a bloodless revolution, but a revolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of our district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world.",
      "Because a just idea cannot but be fruitful.",
      "Yes, it s an aim worth working for.",
      "And its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such a pitiful, worthless creature that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin felt just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of himself as a whole.",
      "That means nothing.",
      "And he too, most likely, had an Agafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets.",
      "Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.",
      "The bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat.",
      "An agreement had been made with the old servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields, so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others.",
      "After dinner Levin was sitting, as he usually did, in an easy chair with a book, and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in connection with his book.",
      "Today all the significance of his book rose before him with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories.",
      "I must write that down, he thought.",
      "That ought to form a brief introduction, which I thought unnecessary before.",
      "He got up to go to his writing-table, and Laska, lying at his feet, got up too, stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go.",
      "But he had not time to write it down, for the head peasants had come round, and Levin went out into the hall to them.",
      "After his levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of the next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him, Levin went back to his study and sat down to work.",
      "Laska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her place with her stocking.",
      "After writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting.",
      "He got up and began walking about the room.",
      "What s the use of being dreary?",
      "Come, why do you stay on at home?",
      "You ought to go to some warm springs, especially now you re ready for the journey.",
      "Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must finish my work.",
      "There, there, your work, you say!",
      "As if you hadn t done enough for the peasants!",
      "Why, as tis, they re saying, Your master will be getting some honor from the Tsar for it.",
      "Indeed and it is a strange thing; why need you worry about the peasants?",
      "I m not worrying about them; I m doing it for my own good.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin s plans for his land.",
      "Levin often put his views before her in all their complexity, and not uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments.",
      "But on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said.",
      "Of one s soul s salvation we all know and must think before all else, she said with a sigh.",
      "Parfen Denisitch now, for all he was no scholar, he died a death that God grant everyone of us the like, she said, referring to a servant who had died recently.",
      "Took the sacrament and all.",
      "That s not what I mean, said he.",
      "I mean that I m acting for my own advantage.",
      "It s all the better for me if the peasants do their work better.",
      "Well, whatever you do, if he s a lazy good-for-nought, everything ll be at sixes and sevens.",
      "If he has a conscience, he ll work, and if not, there s no doing anything.",
      "Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle better.",
      "All I say is, answered Agafea Mihalovna, evidently not speaking at random, but in strict sequence of idea, that you ought to get married, that s what I say.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna s allusion to the very subject he had only just been thinking about, hurt and stung him.",
      "Levin scowled, and without answering her, he sat down again to his work, repeating to himself all that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work.",
      "Only at intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea Mihalovna s needles, and recollecting what he did not want to remember, he frowned again.",
      "At nine o clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud.",
      "Well, here s visitors come to us, and you won t be dull, said Agafea Mihalovna, getting up and going to the door.",
      "But Levin overtook her.",
      "His work was not going well now, and he was glad of a visitor, whoever it might be.",
      "Chapter 31 Running halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he knew, a familiar cough in the hall.",
      "But he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken.",
      "Then he caught sight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay.",
      "Levin loved his brother, but being with him was always a torture.",
      "Just now, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him, and Agafea Mihalovna s hint, was in a troubled and uncertain humor, the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed particularly difficult.",
      "Instead of a lively, healthy visitor, some outsider who would, he hoped, cheer him up in his uncertain humor, he had to see his brother, who knew him through and through, who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart, would force him to show himself fully.",
      "And that he was not disposed to do.",
      "Angry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the hall; as soon as he had seen his brother close, this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity.",
      "Terrible as his brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness, now he looked still more emaciated, still more wasted.",
      "He was a skeleton covered with skin.",
      "He stood in the hall, jerking his long thin neck, and pulling the scarf off it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile.",
      "When he saw that smile, submissive and humble, Levin felt something clutching at his throat.",
      "You see, I ve come to you, said Nikolay in a thick voice, never for one second taking his eyes off his brother s face.",
      "I ve been meaning to a long while, but I ve been unwell all the time.",
      "Now I m ever so much better, he said, rubbing his beard with his big thin hands.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "And he felt still more frightened when, kissing him, he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother s skin and saw close to him his big eyes, full of a strange light.",
      "A few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property, that had remained undivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share.",
      "Nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and, what was more important, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in touch with the earth, so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him.",
      "In spite of his exaggerated stoop, and the emaciation that was so striking from his height, his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever.",
      "Levin led him into his study.",
      "His brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went upstairs.",
      "He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin often remembered him in childhood.",
      "He even referred to Sergey Ivanovitch without rancor.",
      "When he saw Agafea Mihalovna, he made jokes with her and asked after the old servants.",
      "The news of the death of Parfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him.",
      "A look of fear crossed his face, but he regained his serenity immediately.",
      "Of course he was quite old, he said, and changed the subject.",
      "Well, I ll spend a month or two with you, and then I m off to Moscow.",
      "Do you know, Myakov has promised me a place there, and I m going into the service.",
      "Now I m going to arrange my life quite differently, he went on.",
      "You know I got rid of that woman.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna?",
      "Oh, she was a horrid woman!",
      "She caused me all sorts of worries.",
      "But he did not say what the annoyances were.",
      "He could not say that he had cast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak, and, above all, because she would look after him, as though he were an invalid.",
      "Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now.",
      "I ve done silly things, of course, like everyone else, but money s the last consideration; I don t regret it.",
      "So long as there s health, and my health, thank God, is quite restored.",
      "Levin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing to say.",
      "Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother about his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, because then he could speak without hypocrisy.",
      "He told his brother of his plans and his doings.",
      "His brother listened, but evidently he was not interested by it.",
      "These two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest gesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said in words.",
      "Both of them now had only one thought the illness of Nikolay and the nearness of his death which stifled all else.",
      "But neither of them dared to speak of it, and so whatever they said not uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood.",
      "Never had Levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed.",
      "Never with any outside person, never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening.",
      "And the consciousness of this unnaturalness, and the remorse he felt at it, made him even more unnatural.",
      "He wanted to weep over his dying, dearly loved brother, and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live.",
      "As the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.",
      "His brother got into bed, and whether he slept or did not sleep, tossed about like a sick man, coughed, and when he could not get his throat clear, mumbled something.",
      "Sometimes when his breathing was painful, he said, Oh, my God!",
      "Sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily, Ah, the devil!",
      "Levin could not sleep for a long while, hearing him.",
      "His thoughts were of the most various, but the end of all his thoughts was the same death.",
      "Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force.",
      "And death, which was here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit calling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him.",
      "It was in himself too, he felt that.",
      "If not today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn t it all the same!",
      "And what was this inevitable death he did not know, had never thought about it, and what was more, had not the power, had not the courage to think about it.",
      "I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I had forgotten death.",
      "He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and holding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered.",
      "But the more intensely he thought, the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he had forgotten one little fact that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was even worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway.",
      "Yes, it was awful, but it was so.",
      "But I am alive still.",
      "Now what s to be done?",
      "he said in despair.",
      "He lighted a candle, got up cautiously and went to the looking-glass, and began looking at his face and hair.",
      "Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples.",
      "He opened his mouth.",
      "His back teeth were beginning to decay.",
      "He bared his muscular arms.",
      "Yes, there was strength in them.",
      "But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of lungs, had had a strong, healthy body too.",
      "And suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited till Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor Bogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life and happiness.",
      "And now that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing what will become of me, or wherefore.... K...ha!",
      "K...ha!",
      "Damnation!",
      "Why do you keep fidgeting, why don t you go to sleep?",
      "his brother s voice called to him.",
      "Oh, I don t know, I m not sleepy.",
      "I have had a good sleep, I m not in a sweat now.",
      "Just see, feel my shirt; it s not wet, is it?",
      "Levin felt, withdrew behind the screen, and put out the candle, but for a long while he could not sleep.",
      "The question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him, when a new, insoluble question presented itself death.",
      "Why, he s dying yes, he ll die in the spring, and how help him?",
      "What can I say to him?",
      "What do I know about it?",
      "I d even forgotten that it was at all.",
      "Chapter 32 Levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability.",
      "He felt that this was how it would be with his brother.",
      "And his brother Nikolay s gentleness did in fact not last out for long.",
      "The very next morning he began to be irritable, and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking him on his tenderest points.",
      "Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right.",
      "He felt that if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is called, from the heart that is to say, had said only just what they were thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each other s faces, and Konstantin could only have said, You re dying, you re dying!",
      "and Nikolay could only have answered, I know I m dying, but I m afraid, I m afraid, I m afraid!",
      "And they could have said nothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts.",
      "But life like that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life, and never could learn to do, though, as far as he could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and without it there was no living at all.",
      "He tried to say what he was not thinking, but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that his brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it.",
      "The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him again, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding it with communism.",
      "You ve simply borrowed an idea that s not your own, but you ve distorted it, and are trying to apply it where it s not applicable.",
      "But I tell you it s nothing to do with it.",
      "They deny the justice of property, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this chief stimulus.",
      "(Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions, but ever since he had been engrossed by his work, he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words not Russian.)",
      "All I want is to regulate labor.",
      "Which means, you ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that gave it its force, and want to make believe that it s something new, said Nikolay, angrily tugging at his necktie.",
      "But my idea has nothing in common.... That, anyway, said Nikolay Levin, with an ironical smile, his eyes flashing malignantly, has the charm of what s one to call it?",
      "geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness.",
      "It may be a Utopia.",
      "But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the past a _tabula rasa_ no property, no family then labor would organize itself.",
      "But you gain nothing.... Why do you mix things up?",
      "I ve never been a communist.",
      "But I have, and I consider it s premature, but rational, and it has a future, just like Christianity in its first ages.",
      "All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it ought to be studied, its qualities ascertained....",
      "But that s utter waste of time.",
      "That force finds a certain form of activity of itself, according to the stage of its development.",
      "There have been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the half-crop system, rent, and day laborers.",
      "What are you trying to find?",
      "Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms, and that this was hardly possible.",
      "I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers.",
      "I want to organize.... he answered hotly.",
      "You don t want to organize anything; it s simply just as you ve been all your life, that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting the peasants simply, but with some idea in view.",
      "Oh, all right, that s what you think and let me alone!",
      "answered Levin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably.",
      "You ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want is to please your vanity.",
      "Oh, very well; then let me alone!",
      "And I will let you alone!",
      "and it s high time I did, and go to the devil with you!",
      "and I m very sorry I ever came!",
      "In spite of all Levin s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards, Nikolay would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was better to part, and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to him.",
      "Nikolay was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in to him again and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way.",
      "Ah, generosity!",
      "said Nikolay, and he smiled.",
      "If you want to be right, I can give you that satisfaction.",
      "You re in the right; but I m going all the same.",
      "It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him, and said, looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother: Anyway, don t remember evil against me, Kostya!",
      "and his voice quivered.",
      "These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them.",
      "Levin knew that those words meant, You see, and you know, that I m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other again.",
      "Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes.",
      "He kissed his brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to say.",
      "Three days after his brother s departure, Levin too set off for his foreign tour.",
      "Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky, Kitty s cousin, in the railway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression.",
      "Shtcherbatsky asked him.",
      "Oh, nothing; there s not much happiness in life.",
      "Not much?",
      "You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen.",
      "You shall see how to be happy.",
      "No, I ve done with it all.",
      "It s time I was dead.",
      "Well, that s a good one!",
      "said Shtcherbatsky, laughing; why, I m only just getting ready to begin.",
      "Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon be dead.",
      "Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late.",
      "He saw nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything.",
      "But his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more.",
      "Life had to be got through somehow till death did come.",
      "Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work, and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength.",
      "PART FOUR Chapter 1 The Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met every day, but were complete strangers to one another.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at home.",
      "Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch s house, but Anna saw him away from home, and her husband was aware of it.",
      "The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had not been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch hoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that everyone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.",
      "Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable than for anyone, endured it because she not merely hoped, but firmly believed, that it would all very soon be settled and come right.",
      "She had not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now.",
      "Vronsky, against his own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something, apart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.",
      "In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week.",
      "A foreign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under his charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing.",
      "Vronsky was of distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of behaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with such grand personages that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince.",
      "But he felt his duties very irksome.",
      "The prince was anxious to miss nothing of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in Russia?",
      "And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all Russian forms of amusement.",
      "Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both these inclinations.",
      "The mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the national entertainments.",
      "The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even among princes.",
      "By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber.",
      "The prince had traveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations.",
      "He had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin.",
      "In Switzerland he had killed chamois.",
      "In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet.",
      "In Turkey he had got into a harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia he wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.",
      "Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him, was at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince.",
      "They had race horses, and Russian pancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and drinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery.",
      "And the prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit, smashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and seemed to be asking what more, and does the whole Russian spirit consist in just this?",
      "In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne.",
      "Vronsky was used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of late, or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him.",
      "The whole of that week he experienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a dangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from being with him, fearing for his own reason.",
      "Vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted.",
      "The prince s manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky s surprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with Russian amusements, was contemptuous.",
      "His criticisms of Russian women, whom he wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with indignation.",
      "The chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him.",
      "And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem.",
      "He was a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very well-washed man, and nothing else.",
      "He was a gentleman that was true, and Vronsky could not deny it.",
      "He was equable and not cringing with his superiors, was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals, and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors.",
      "Vronsky was himself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so.",
      "But for this prince he was an inferior, and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him.",
      "Brainless beef!",
      "can I be like that?",
      "Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the prince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself.",
      "He said good-bye to him at the station on their return from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian prowess kept up all night.",
      "Chapter 2 When he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna.",
      "She wrote, I am ill and unhappy.",
      "I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer without seeing you.",
      "Come in this evening.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to the council at seven and will be there till ten.",
      "Thinking for an instant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her, in spite of her husband s insisting on her not receiving him, he decided to go.",
      "Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left the regimental quarters, and was living alone.",
      "After having some lunch, he lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were confused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the peasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky fell asleep.",
      "He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made haste to light a candle.",
      "What was the dreadful thing I dreamed?",
      "Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in French.",
      "Yes, there was nothing else in the dream, he said to himself.",
      "But why was it so awful?",
      "He vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the peasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his spine.",
      "thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.",
      "It was half-past eight already.",
      "He rang up his servant, dressed in haste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late.",
      "As he drove up to the Karenins entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine.",
      "A high, narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance.",
      "He recognized Anna s carriage.",
      "She is coming to me, thought Vronsky, and better she should.",
      "I don t like going into that house.",
      "But no matter; I can t hide myself, he thought, and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of, Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door.",
      "The door opened, and the hall-porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage.",
      "Vronsky, though he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him.",
      "In the very doorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.",
      "Karenin s fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky s face.",
      "Vronsky bowed, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to his hat and went on.",
      "Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the carriage, pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and disappear.",
      "Vronsky went into the hall.",
      "His brows were scowling, and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.",
      "What a position!",
      "If he would fight, would stand up for his honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or baseness....",
      "He puts me in the position of playing false, which I never meant and never mean to do.",
      "Vronsky s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna in the Vrede garden.",
      "Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna who had surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply looked to him to decide her fate, ready to submit to anything he had long ceased to think that their tie might end as he had thought then.",
      "His ambitious plans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he had given himself entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her.",
      "He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps.",
      "He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him, and was now going back to the drawing-room.",
      "No, she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes.",
      "No; if things are to go on like this, the end will come much, much too soon.",
      "What is it, dear one?",
      "I ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ... No, I won t ...",
      "I can t quarrel with you.",
      "Of course you couldn t come.",
      "No, I won t. She laid her two hands on his shoulders, and looked a long while at him with a profound, passionate, and at the same time searching look.",
      "She was studying his face to make up for the time she had not seen him.",
      "She was, every time she saw him, making the picture of him in her imagination (incomparably superior, impossible in reality) fit with him as he really was.",
      "Chapter 3 You met him?",
      "she asked, when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight.",
      "You re punished, you see, for being late.",
      "Yes; but how was it?",
      "Wasn t he to be at the council?",
      "He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again.",
      "But that s no matter.",
      "Don t talk about it.",
      "Where have you been?",
      "With the prince still?",
      "She knew every detail of his existence.",
      "He was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face, he was ashamed.",
      "And he said he had had to go to report on the prince s departure.",
      "But it s over now?",
      "He is gone?",
      "Thank God it s over!",
      "You wouldn t believe how insufferable it s been for me.",
      "Isn t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?",
      "she said, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at Vronsky.",
      "I gave that life up long ago, said he, wondering at the change in her face, and trying to divine its meaning.",
      "And I confess, he said, with a smile, showing his thick, white teeth, this week I ve been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn t like it.",
      "She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him with strange, shining, and hostile eyes.",
      "This morning Liza came to see me they re not afraid to call on me, in spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, she put in and she told me about your Athenian evening.",
      "How loathsome!",
      "I was just going to say.... She interrupted him.",
      "It was that Th r se you used to know?",
      "I was just saying.... How disgusting you are, you men!",
      "How is it you can t understand that a woman can never forget that, she said, getting more and more angry, and so letting him see the cause of her irritation, especially a woman who cannot know your life?",
      "What have I ever known?",
      "she said, what you tell me.",
      "And how do I know whether you tell me the truth?...",
      "Anna, you hurt me.",
      "Don t you trust me?",
      "Haven t I told you that I haven t a thought I wouldn t lay bare to you?",
      "Yes, yes, she said, evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts.",
      "But if only you knew how wretched I am!",
      "I believe you, I believe you.... What were you saying?",
      "But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say.",
      "These fits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with her, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise the fact, made him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him.",
      "How often he had told himself that her love was happiness; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow.",
      "Then he had thought himself unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind.",
      "She was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her.",
      "Both morally and physically she had changed for the worse.",
      "She had broadened out all over, and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it.",
      "He looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it.",
      "And in spite of this he felt that then, when his love was stronger, he could, if he had greatly wished it, have torn that love out of his heart; but now, when as at that moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her, he knew that what bound him to her could not be broken.",
      "Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?",
      "I have driven away the fiend, she added.",
      "The fiend was the name they had given her jealousy.",
      "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
      "Why did you find it so tiresome?",
      "Oh, it was intolerable!",
      "he said, trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought.",
      "He does not improve on closer acquaintance.",
      "If you want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more, he said, with a tone of vexation that interested her.",
      "No; how so?",
      "she replied.",
      "He s seen a great deal, anyway; he s cultured?",
      "It s an utterly different culture their culture.",
      "He s cultivated, one sees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise everything but animal pleasures.",
      "But don t you all care for these animal pleasures?",
      "she said, and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.",
      "How is it you re defending him?",
      "he said, smiling.",
      "I m not defending him, it s nothing to me; but I imagine, if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have got out of them.",
      "But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Th r se in the attire of Eve.... Again, the devil again, Vronsky said, taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it.",
      "Yes; but I can t help it.",
      "You don t know what I have suffered waiting for you.",
      "I believe I m not jealous.",
      "I m not jealous: I believe you when you re here; but when you re away somewhere leading your life, so incomprehensible to me.... She turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.",
      "How was it, then?",
      "Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch?",
      "Her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.",
      "We ran up against each other in the doorway.",
      "And he bowed to you like this?",
      "She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed her expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had bowed to him.",
      "He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep laugh, which was one of her greatest charms.",
      "I don t understand him in the least, said Vronsky.",
      "If after your avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had called me out but this I can t understand.",
      "How can he put up with such a position?",
      "He feels it, that s evident.",
      "He?",
      "she said sneeringly.",
      "He s perfectly satisfied.",
      "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
      "Only not he.",
      "Don t I know him, the falsity in which he s utterly steeped?...",
      "Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?",
      "He understands nothing, and feels nothing.",
      "Could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife?",
      "Could he talk to her, call her my dear ?",
      "And again she could not help mimicking him: Anna, _ma ch re_; Anna, dear!",
      "He s not a man, not a human being he s a doll!",
      "No one knows him; but I know him.",
      "Oh, if I d been in his place, I d long ago have killed, have torn to pieces a wife like me.",
      "I wouldn t have said, Anna, _ma ch re_ !",
      "He s not a man, he s an official machine.",
      "He doesn t understand that I m your wife, that he s outside, that he s superfluous.... Don t let s talk of him!...",
      "You re unfair, very unfair, dearest, said Vronsky, trying to soothe her.",
      "But never mind, don t let s talk of him.",
      "Tell me what you ve been doing?",
      "What is the matter?",
      "What has been wrong with you, and what did the doctor say?",
      "She looked at him with mocking amusement.",
      "Evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them.",
      "But he went on: I imagine that it s not illness, but your condition.",
      "When will it be?",
      "The ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, a consciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet melancholy, came over her face.",
      "Soon, soon.",
      "You say that our position is miserable, that we must put an end to it.",
      "If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would give to be able to love you freely and boldly!",
      "I should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but not as we expect.",
      "And at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go on.",
      "She laid her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the lamplight.",
      "It won t come as we suppose.",
      "I didn t mean to say this to you, but you ve made me.",
      "Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall all, all be at peace, and suffer no more.",
      "I don t understand, he said, understanding her.",
      "You asked when?",
      "Soon.",
      "And I shan t live through it.",
      "Don t interrupt me!",
      "and she made haste to speak.",
      "I know it; I know for certain.",
      "I shall die; and I m very glad I shall die, and release myself and you.",
      "Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began kissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, had no sort of grounds, though he could not control it.",
      "Yes, it s better so, she said, tightly gripping his hand.",
      "That s the only way, the only way left us.",
      "He had recovered himself, and lifted his head.",
      "How absurd!",
      "What absurd nonsense you are talking!",
      "No, it s the truth.",
      "What, what s the truth?",
      "That I shall die.",
      "I have had a dream.",
      "A dream?",
      "repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream.",
      "Yes, a dream, she said.",
      "It s a long while since I dreamed it.",
      "I dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there, to find out something; you know how it is in dreams, she said, her eyes wide with horror; and in the bedroom, in the corner, stood something.",
      "Oh, what nonsense!",
      "How can you believe....",
      "But she would not let him interrupt her.",
      "What she was saying was too important to her.",
      "And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking.",
      "I wanted to run away, but he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his hands.... She showed how he had moved his hands.",
      "There was terror in her face.",
      "And Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror filling his soul.",
      "He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you know: _Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le p trir_.... And in my horror I tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream.",
      "And I began asking myself what it meant.",
      "And Korney said to me: In childbirth you ll die, ma am, you ll die.... And I woke up.",
      "What nonsense, what nonsense!",
      "said Vronsky; but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice.",
      "But don t let s talk of it.",
      "Ring the bell, I ll have tea.",
      "And stay a little now; it s not long I shall....",
      "But all at once she stopped.",
      "The expression of her face instantaneously changed.",
      "Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft, solemn, blissful attention.",
      "He could not comprehend the meaning of the change.",
      "She was listening to the stirring of the new life within her.",
      "Chapter 4 Alexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, drove, as he had intended, to the Italian opera.",
      "He sat through two acts there, and saw everyone he had wanted to see.",
      "On returning home, he carefully scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there, he went, as usual, to his own room.",
      "But, contrary to his usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and down his study till three o clock in the morning.",
      "The feeling of furious anger with his wife, who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her, not to receive her lover in her own home, gave him no peace.",
      "She had not complied with his request, and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain a divorce and take away his son.",
      "He knew all the difficulties connected with this course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must carry out his threat.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties.",
      "Misfortunes never come singly, and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes, and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province, had brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he had been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability.",
      "He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of vast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the morning.",
      "He dressed in haste, and as though carrying his cup full of wrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife, he went into her room directly he heard she was up.",
      "Anna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her.",
      "His brow was lowering, and his eyes stared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut.",
      "In his walk, in his gestures, in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him.",
      "He went into her room, and without greeting her, walked straight up to her writing-table, and taking her keys, opened a drawer.",
      "Your lover s letters, he said.",
      "They re not here, she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action he saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers.",
      "She tried to pull the portfolio away, but he pushed her back.",
      "Sit down!",
      "I have to speak to you, he said, putting the portfolio under his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up.",
      "Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in silence.",
      "I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this house.",
      "I had to see him to.... She stopped, not finding a reason.",
      "I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover.",
      "I meant, I only.... she said, flushing hotly.",
      "This coarseness of his angered her, and gave her courage.",
      "Surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me?",
      "An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief he s a thief is simply _la constatation d un fait_.",
      "This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.",
      "You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, giving her the honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition of observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?",
      "It s worse than cruel it s base, if you want to know!",
      "Anna cried, in a rush of hatred, and getting up, she was going away.",
      "he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher than usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing, he forcibly sat her down in her place.",
      "Base!",
      "If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover, while you eat your husband s bread!",
      "She bowed her head.",
      "She did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover, that _he_ was her husband, and her husband was superfluous; she did not even think that.",
      "She felt all the justice of his words, and only said softly: You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself; but what are you saying all this for?",
      "What am I saying it for?",
      "he went on, as angrily.",
      "That you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum, I will take measures to put an end to this state of things.",
      "Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway, she said; and again, at the thought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came into her eyes.",
      "It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned!",
      "If you must have the satisfaction of animal passion.... Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "I won t say it s not generous, but it s not like a gentleman to strike anyone who s down.",
      "Yes, you only think of yourself!",
      "But the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you.",
      "You don t care that his whole life is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff.... Alexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering.",
      "In the end he pronounced it thuffering.",
      "She wanted to laugh, and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment.",
      "And for the first time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in his place, and was sorry for him.",
      "But what could she say or do?",
      "Her head sank, and she sat silent.",
      "He too was silent for some time, and then began speaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that had no special significance.",
      "I came to tell you.... he said.",
      "She glanced at him.",
      "No, it was my fancy, she thought, recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word suffering.",
      "No; can a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency, feel anything?",
      "I cannot change anything, she whispered.",
      "I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall not return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of getting a divorce.",
      "My son is going to my sister s, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son.",
      "You take Seryozha to hurt me, she said, looking at him from under her brows.",
      "You do not love him.... Leave me Seryozha!",
      "Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is associated with the repulsion I feel for you.",
      "But still I shall take him.",
      "Good-bye!",
      "And he was going away, but now she detained him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!",
      "she whispered once more.",
      "I have nothing else to say.",
      "Leave Seryozha till my ...",
      "I shall soon be confined; leave him!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his hand from her, he went out of the room without a word.",
      "Chapter 5 The waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when Alexey Alexandrovitch entered it.",
      "Three ladies an old lady, a young lady, and a merchant s wife and three gentlemen one a German banker with a ring on his finger, the second a merchant with a beard, and the third a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform, with a cross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already.",
      "Two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens.",
      "The appurtenances of the writing-tables, about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself very fastidious, were exceptionally good.",
      "He could not help observing this.",
      "One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to Alexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his eyes.",
      "What are you wanting?",
      "He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.",
      "He is engaged, the clerk responded severely, and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.",
      "Can t he spare time to see me?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He has no time free; he is always busy.",
      "Kindly wait your turn.",
      "Then I must trouble you to give him my card, Alexey Alexandrovitch said with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito.",
      "The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he read on it, went to the door.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of it, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the Emperor.",
      "His whole life had been spent in administrative work, and consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department.",
      "In the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases.",
      "But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts, and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the lawyer s waiting room.",
      "Coming immediately, said the clerk; and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who had been consulting with the lawyer himself.",
      "The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard, light-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow.",
      "He was attired as though for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and varnished boots.",
      "His face was clever and manly, but his dress was dandified and in bad taste.",
      "Pray walk in, said the lawyer, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch; and, gloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed the door.",
      "Won t you sit down?",
      "He indicated an armchair at a writing-table covered with papers.",
      "He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his head on one side.",
      "But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table.",
      "The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him, opened his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his former attitude.",
      "Before beginning to speak of my business, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, following the lawyer s movements with wondering eyes, I ought to observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be strictly private.",
      "The lawyer s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely perceptible smile.",
      "I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to me.",
      "But if you would like proof.... Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd, gray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.",
      "You know my name?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.",
      "I know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing, like every Russian, said the lawyer, bowing.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his courage.",
      "But having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice, without timidity or hesitation, accentuating here and there a word.",
      "I have the misfortune, Alexey Alexandrovitch began, to have been deceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is, to be divorced, but to do this so that my son may not remain with his mother.",
      "The lawyer s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there was triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw in his wife s eyes.",
      "You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?",
      "Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your time and attention.",
      "I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step.",
      "I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of great consequence to me.",
      "It is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.",
      "Oh, that s always the case, said the lawyer, and that s always for you to decide.",
      "He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch s feet, feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement.",
      "He looked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but did not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch s position.",
      "Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me, pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch, I should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice.",
      "You would be glad, the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded, adopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client s remarks, for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire?",
      "And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went on, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch s face, which was growing red in patches.",
      "Divorce by our laws, he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws, is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....",
      "Wait a little!",
      "he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door, but he got up all the same, said a few words to him, and sat down again.",
      "In the following cases: physical defect in the married parties, desertion without communication for five years, he said, crooking a short finger covered with hair, adultery (this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction), subdivided as follows (he continued to crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together): physical defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the wife.",
      "As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his fingers and went on: This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice.",
      "And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following there s no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.",
      "May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection.",
      "It must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice, said the lawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused, as a man selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon, might await his customer s choice.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch said nothing, and therefore the lawyer went on: The most usual and simple, the sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent.",
      "I should not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no education, he said, but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual consent, and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance.",
      "People cannot go on living together here you have a fact.",
      "And if both are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no importance.",
      "And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now.",
      "But he had religious scruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.",
      "That is out of the question in the present case, he said.",
      "Only one alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters which I have.",
      "At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.",
      "Kindly consider, he began, cases of that kind are, as you are aware, under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind, he said with a smile, which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers taste.",
      "Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in the fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by eyewitnesses.",
      "In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your confidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed.",
      "If one wants the result, one must admit the means.",
      "If it is so.... Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white; but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk.",
      "Tell her we don t haggle over fees!",
      "he said, and returned to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "On his way back he caught unobserved another moth.",
      "Nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer!",
      "he thought, frowning.",
      "And so you were saying?...",
      "I will communicate my decision to you by letter, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table.",
      "After standing a moment in silence, he said: From your words I may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained?",
      "I would ask you to let me know what are your terms.",
      "It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action, said the lawyer, not answering his question.",
      "When can I reckon on receiving information from you?",
      "he asked, moving towards the door, his eyes and his varnished boots shining.",
      "In a week s time.",
      "Your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to communicate to me.",
      "The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, and, left alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement.",
      "He felt so mirthful that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet, like Sigonin s. Chapter 6 Alexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet.",
      "The new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Within three months a report was presented.",
      "The condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and religious aspects.",
      "To all these questions there were answers admirably stated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a product of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the product of official activity.",
      "The answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents, founded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish priests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain.",
      "All such questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of the adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs, etc.",
      "questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the official machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages received full, unhesitating solution.",
      "And this solution was in favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch s contention.",
      "But Stremov, who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the commission s report, resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not anticipated.",
      "Stremov, carrying with him several members, went over to Alexey Alexandrovitch s side, and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by Karenin, proposed other more extreme measures in the same direction.",
      "These measures, still further exaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch s fundamental idea, were passed by the commission, and then the aim of Stremov s tactics became apparent.",
      "Carried to an extreme, the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities, and public opinion, and intellectual ladies, and the newspapers, all at the same time fell foul of them, expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Stremov drew back, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done.",
      "This meant the defeat of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "But in spite of failing health, in spite of his domestic griefs, he did not give in.",
      "There was a split in the commission.",
      "Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission.",
      "In consequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in society, all was chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined, or whether they were in a flourishing condition.",
      "The position of Alexey Alexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his wife s infidelity, became very precarious.",
      "And in this position he took an important resolution.",
      "To the astonishment of the commission, he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot.",
      "And having obtained permission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote provinces.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s departure made a great sensation, the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares allowed him for twelve horses, to drive to his destination.",
      "I think it very noble, Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya.",
      "Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now?",
      "But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya s opinion annoyed her indeed.",
      "It s all very well for you to talk, said she, when you have I don t know how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer.",
      "It s very good for him and pleasant traveling about, and it s a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and coachman on the money.",
      "On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for three days at Moscow.",
      "The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the governor-general.",
      "At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are always crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round.",
      "At the corner of the pavement, in a short, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily askew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming.",
      "He called him vigorously and urgently, and insisted on his stopping.",
      "He had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two children.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his brother-in-law.",
      "The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved her hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "It was Dolly with her children.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least of all his wife s brother.",
      "He raised his hat and would have driven on, but Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across the snow to him.",
      "Well, what a shame not to have let us know!",
      "I was at Dussots yesterday and saw Karenin on the visitors list, but it never entered my head that it was you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, sticking his head in at the window of the carriage, or I should have looked you up.",
      "I am glad to see you!",
      "he said, knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off.",
      "What a shame of you not to let us know!",
      "I had no time; I am very busy, Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly.",
      "Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?",
      "said Dolly, smiling.",
      "I was very busy.",
      "Delighted to see you!",
      "he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it.",
      "How are you?",
      "Tell me, how is my darling Anna?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on.",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.",
      "I tell you what we ll do tomorrow.",
      "Dolly, ask him to dinner.",
      "We ll ask Koznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him with our Moscow celebrities.",
      "Yes, please, do come, said Dolly; we will expect you at five, or six o clock, if you like.",
      "How is my darling Anna?",
      "How long.... She is quite well, Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled, frowning.",
      "and he moved away towards his carriage.",
      "You will come?",
      "Dolly called after him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages.",
      "I shall come round tomorrow!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen.",
      "Queer fish!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his watch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a caress to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the pavement.",
      "Dolly called, reddening.",
      "He turned round.",
      "I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya.",
      "Give me the money.",
      "Never mind; you tell them I ll pay the bill!",
      "and he vanished, nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by.",
      "Chapter 7 The next day was Sunday.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty dancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little face, radiant over her present.",
      "Besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet.",
      "After explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper.",
      "From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o clock was at Dussots , where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at the same hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there; the new head of his department, who had just been promoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow; and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a dinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests.",
      "He particularly liked the program of that day s dinner.",
      "There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and _la pi ce de resistance_ first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines to suit: so much for the eating and drinking.",
      "Kitty and Levin would be of the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there would be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and _la pi ce de resistance_ among the guests Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician.",
      "He was asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a liberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish for Koznishev and Karenin.",
      "He would provoke them and set them off.",
      "The second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and good-humored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view.",
      "He was in the most light-hearted mood.",
      "There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "These two circumstances were: first, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the street he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and putting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch s face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.",
      "That was one disagreeable thing.",
      "The other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his department, like all new heads, had the reputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o clock in the morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way.",
      "Moreover, this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners, and was, according to all reports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself.",
      "On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance.",
      "Consequently Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non-official dress.",
      "The thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing.",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _come round_ all right.",
      "They re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty and quarrelsome?",
      "he thought as he went into the hotel.",
      "Good-day, Vassily, he said, walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew; why, you ve let your whiskers grow!",
      "Levin, number seven, eh?",
      "Take me up, please.",
      "And find out whether Count Anitchkin (this was the new head) is receiving.",
      "Yes, sir, Vassily responded, smiling.",
      "You ve not been to see us for a long while.",
      "I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance.",
      "Is this number seven?",
      "Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room, measuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.",
      "you killed him?",
      "cried Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well done!",
      "A she-bear?",
      "How are you, Arhip!",
      "He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair, without taking off his coat and hat.",
      "Come, take off your coat and stay a little, said Levin, taking his hat.",
      "No, I haven t time; I ve only looked in for a tiny second, answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He threw open his coat, but afterwards did take it off, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects.",
      "Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.",
      "Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England not in the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that was new to me.",
      "And I m glad I went.",
      "Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.",
      "Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question.",
      "In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land; though the question exists there too but there it s a matter of repairing what s been ruined, while with us.... Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.",
      "he said, it s very possible you re right.",
      "But I m glad you re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and interested.",
      "Shtcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death.... Well, what of it?",
      "I ve not given up thinking of death, said Levin.",
      "It s true that it s high time I was dead; and that all this is nonsense.",
      "It s the truth I m telling you.",
      "I do value my idea and my work awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.",
      "And for us to suppose we can have something great ideas, work it s all dust and ashes.",
      "But all that s as old as the hills, my boy!",
      "It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow everything becomes of no consequence.",
      "When you understand that you will die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything is so unimportant!",
      "And I consider my idea very important, but it turns out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as doing for that bear.",
      "So one goes on living, amusing oneself with hunting, with work anything so as not to think of death!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to Levin.",
      "Well, of course!",
      "Here you ve come round to my point.",
      "Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?",
      "Don t be so severe, O moralist!",
      "No; all the same, what s fine in life is.... Levin hesitated oh, I don t know.",
      "All I know is that we shall soon be dead.",
      "Why so soon?",
      "And do you know, there s less charm in life, when one thinks of death, but there s more peace.",
      "On the contrary, the finish is always the best.",
      "But I must be going, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.",
      "Oh, no, stay a bit!",
      "said Levin, keeping him.",
      "Now, when shall we see each other again?",
      "I m going tomorrow.",
      "I m a nice person!",
      "Why, that s just what I came for!",
      "You simply must come to dinner with us today.",
      "Your brother s coming, and Karenin, my brother-in-law.",
      "You don t mean to say he s here?",
      "said Levin, and he wanted to inquire about Kitty.",
      "He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he did not know whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did not ask.",
      "Whether she s coming or not, I don t care, he said to himself.",
      "So you ll come?",
      "At five o clock, then, and not evening dress.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his department.",
      "Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "The terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on, so that it was four o clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Chapter 8 Alexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent the whole morning indoors.",
      "He had two pieces of business before him that morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow; secondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer.",
      "The deputation, though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch s instigation, was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was glad he had found it in Moscow.",
      "The members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.",
      "They na vely believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask assistance of the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy s side, and so spoiled the whole business.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation.",
      "He had his chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "She was a specialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than she how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go.",
      "Having completed this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer.",
      "Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best.",
      "In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky s notes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he had taken away.",
      "Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again, and since he had been at the lawyer s and had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention, since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to his own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution.",
      "He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he heard the loud tones of Stepan Arkadyevitch s voice.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with Alexey Alexandrovitch s servant, and insisting on being announced.",
      "No matter, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, so much the better.",
      "I will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister, and explain why it is I can t dine with him.",
      "Come in!",
      "he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting them in the blotting-paper.",
      "There, you see, you re talking nonsense, and he s at home!",
      "responded Stepan Arkadyevitch s voice, addressing the servant, who had refused to let him in, and taking off his coat as he went, Oblonsky walked into the room.",
      "Well, I m awfully glad I ve found you!",
      "So I hope.... Stepan Arkadyevitch began cheerfully.",
      "I cannot come, Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing and not asking his visitor to sit down.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce.",
      "But he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear, shining eyes.",
      "Why can t you?",
      "he asked in perplexity, speaking in French.",
      "Oh, but it s a promise.",
      "And we re all counting on you.",
      "I want to tell you that I can t dine at your house, because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease.",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile.",
      "Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my wife.",
      "I ought to have....",
      "But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence, Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected.",
      "He groaned and sank into an armchair.",
      "No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "What are you saying?",
      "cried Oblonsky, and his suffering was apparent in his face.",
      "It is so.",
      "Excuse me, I can t, I can t believe it!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make, his relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.",
      "Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce, he said.",
      "I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I know you for an excellent, upright man; I know Anna excuse me, I can t change my opinion of her for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I cannot believe it.",
      "There is some misunderstanding, said he.",
      "Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...",
      "Pardon, I understand, interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But of course.... One thing: you must not act in haste.",
      "You must not, you must not act in haste!",
      "I am not acting in haste, Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter.",
      "I have quite made up my mind.",
      "This is awful!",
      "I would do one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I beseech you, do it!",
      "No action has yet been taken, if I understand rightly.",
      "Before you take advice, see my wife, talk to her.",
      "She loves Anna like a sister, she loves you, and she s a wonderful woman.",
      "For God s sake, talk to her!",
      "Do me that favor, I beseech you!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him sympathetically, without interrupting his silence.",
      "You will go to see her?",
      "That was just why I have not been to see you.",
      "I imagine our relations must change.",
      "I don t see that.",
      "Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing his hand.",
      "Even if your worst suppositions were correct, I don t and never would take on myself to judge either side, and I see no reason why our relations should be affected.",
      "But now, do this, come and see my wife.",
      "Well, we look at the matter differently, said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly.",
      "However, we won t discuss it.",
      "No; why shouldn t you come today to dine, anyway?",
      "My wife s expecting you.",
      "Please, do come.",
      "And, above all, talk it over with her.",
      "She s a wonderful woman.",
      "For God s sake, on my knees, I implore you!",
      "If you so much wish it, I will come, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sighing.",
      "And, anxious to change the conversation, he inquired about what interested them both the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch s department, a man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin, and had always differed from him in his opinions.",
      "But now, from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion, he could not endure him.",
      "Well, have you seen him?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant smile.",
      "Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday.",
      "He seems to know his work capitally, and to be very energetic.",
      "Yes, but what is his energy directed to?",
      "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what s been done?",
      "It s the great misfortune of our government this paper administration, of which he s a worthy representative.",
      "Really, I don t know what fault one could find with him.",
      "His policy I don t know, but one thing he s a very nice fellow, answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I ve just been seeing him, and he s really a capital fellow.",
      "We lunched together, and I taught him how to make, you know that drink, wine and oranges.",
      "It s so cooling.",
      "And it s a wonder he didn t know it.",
      "He liked it awfully.",
      "No, really he s a capital fellow.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.",
      "Why, good heavens, it s four already, and I ve still to go to Dolgovushin s!",
      "So please come round to dinner.",
      "You can t imagine how you will grieve my wife and me.",
      "The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was very different from the manner in which he had met him.",
      "I ve promised, and I ll come, he answered wearily.",
      "Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won t regret it, answered Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "And, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head, chuckled, and went out.",
      "At five o clock, and not evening dress, please, he shouted once more, turning at the door.",
      "Chapter 9 It was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the host himself got home.",
      "He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same moment.",
      "These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow intellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them.",
      "Both were men respected for their character and their intelligence.",
      "They respected each other, but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject, not because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because they were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views); but, in that party, each had his own special shade of opinion.",
      "And since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions, they never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed to jeer without anger, each at the other s incorrigible aberrations.",
      "They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them.",
      "In the drawing-room there were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young Shtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing-room without him.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband s absence, was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him.",
      "All were sitting like so many priests wives on a visit (so the old prince expressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent.",
      "Turovtsin good, simple man felt unmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words: Well, old boy, you have popped me down in a learned set!",
      "A drinking party now, or the _Ch teau des Fleurs_, would be more in my line!",
      "The old prince sat in silence, his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side, and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon.",
      "Kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.",
      "Young Shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it.",
      "Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering.",
      "He was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.",
      "On entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining that he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland, into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov.",
      "Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered something comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old prince.",
      "Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening, and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin.",
      "In a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing-room became very lively, and there was a merry buzz of voices.",
      "Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not arrived.",
      "But this was so much the better, as going into the dining-room, Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from Depr , and not from Levy, and, directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy s, he was going back to the drawing-room.",
      "In the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.",
      "I m not late?",
      "You can never help being late!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking his arm.",
      "Have you a lot of people?",
      "Who s here?",
      "asked Levin, unable to help blushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove.",
      "All our own set.",
      "Kitty s here.",
      "Come along, I ll introduce you to Karenin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so treated his best friends to this honor.",
      "But at that instant Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance.",
      "He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad.",
      "He had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today.",
      "But to keep his thoughts free, he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it.",
      "Now when he heard that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such delight, and at the same time of such dread, that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say.",
      "What is she like, what is she like?",
      "Like what she used to be, or like what she was in the carriage?",
      "What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth?",
      "Why shouldn t it be the truth?",
      "Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin, he brought out with an effort, and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing-room and beheld her.",
      "She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in the carriage; she was quite different.",
      "She was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it.",
      "She saw him the very instant he walked into the room.",
      "She had been expecting him.",
      "She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all, thought she would break down and would begin to cry.",
      "She crimsoned, turned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her.",
      "He went up to her, bowed, and held out his hand without speaking.",
      "Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm as she said: How long it is since we ve seen each other!",
      "and with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.",
      "You ve not seen me, but I ve seen you, said Levin, with a radiant smile of happiness.",
      "I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo.",
      "she asked, wondering.",
      "You were driving to Ergushovo, said Levin, feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart.",
      "And how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature?",
      "And, yes, I do believe it s true what Darya Alexandrovna told me, he thought.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.",
      "Let me introduce you.",
      "He mentioned their names.",
      "Very glad to meet you again, said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly, shaking hands with Levin.",
      "You are acquainted?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.",
      "We spent three hours together in the train, said Levin smiling, but got out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified at least I was.",
      "Come along, please, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing in the direction of the dining-room.",
      "The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver spades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds, and plates with slices of French bread.",
      "The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies, and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev, Karenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent.",
      "He did this now.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the Russian government.",
      "Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated.",
      "Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations.",
      "As they were going out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said, smiling: So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can.",
      "My brother and I are terribly in fault, I see.",
      "You married men, especially you, Stepan Arkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?",
      "he said, smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine-glass to him.",
      "Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.",
      "Oh, yes, that s the best method!",
      "he said, munching cheese and filling the wine-glass with a special sort of spirit.",
      "The conversation dropped at the jest.",
      "This cheese is not bad.",
      "Shall I give you some?",
      "said the master of the house.",
      "Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?",
      "he asked Levin, pinching his muscle with his left hand.",
      "Levin smiled, bent his arm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch s fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, through the fine cloth of the coat.",
      "What biceps!",
      "A perfect Samson!",
      "I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears, observed Alexey Alexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase.",
      "He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.",
      "Levin smiled.",
      "Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear, he said, with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the table.",
      "You have killed a bear, I ve been told!",
      "said Kitty, trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm.",
      "Are there bears on your place?",
      "she added, turning her charming little head to him and smiling.",
      "There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of her lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it!",
      "There was entreaty for forgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness soft, timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him, which he could not but believe in and which choked him with happiness.",
      "No, we ve been hunting in the Tver province.",
      "It was coming back from there that I met your _beau-fr re_ in the train, or your _beau-fr re s_ brother-in-law, he said with a smile.",
      "It was an amusing meeting.",
      "And he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all night, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into Alexey Alexandrovitch s compartment.",
      "The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in elevated language, and ... you, too, he said, addressing Karenin and forgetting his name, at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely grateful.",
      "The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill-defined, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief.",
      "I saw you were in uncertainty about me, said Levin, smiling good-naturedly, but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one ear for his brother, and he glanced askance at him.",
      "What is the matter with him today?",
      "Why such a conquering hero?",
      "He did not know that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings.",
      "Levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him.",
      "And this was the only thing that interested him.",
      "Not in that room only, but in the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she.",
      "He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down below were all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the world.",
      "Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though there were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side.",
      "Oh, you may as well sit there, he said to Levin.",
      "The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was a connoisseur.",
      "The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.",
      "The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly.",
      "On the material side the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial.",
      "The conversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never paused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey Alexandrovitch thawed.",
      "Chapter 10 Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch s words, especially as he felt the injustice of his view.",
      "I did not mean, he said over the soup, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, mere density of population alone, but in conjunction with fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.",
      "It seems to me, Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no haste, that that s the same thing.",
      "In my opinion, influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development, which....",
      "But that s just the question, Pestsov broke in in his bass.",
      "He was always in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his whole soul into what he was saying.",
      "In what are we to make higher development consist?",
      "The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest stage of development?",
      "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
      "We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at a lower stage!",
      "There is another law at work there.",
      "I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his eyebrows.",
      "But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization?",
      "said Pestsov.",
      "I imagine such signs are generally very well known, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "But are they fully known?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile.",
      "It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor.",
      "You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Will you take red wine?",
      "I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture, Sergey Ivanovitch said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension, as to a child.",
      "I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them, he went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "My sympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion.",
      "I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies.",
      "The natural sciences have just as great an educational value, put in Pestsov.",
      "Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of general principles.",
      "I cannot quite agree with that, responded Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development.",
      "Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass.",
      "He began warmly contesting the justice of this view.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing reply ready.",
      "But, said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin, One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral _disons le mot_ anti-nihilist influence.",
      "Undoubtedly.",
      "If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides, said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies.",
      "But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients....",
      "But what if they had no such medicinal property?",
      "he wound up humorously.",
      "At Sergey Ivanovitch s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found something to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to conversation.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov.",
      "With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.",
      "Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest, Pestsov promptly started a new one.",
      "I can t agree even, said he, that the government had that aim.",
      "The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise.",
      "The education of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.",
      "And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous.",
      "I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably connected together, said Pestsov; it is a vicious circle.",
      "Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights.",
      "We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us, said he.",
      "You said rights, said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had finished, meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service, of sitting in parliament....",
      "But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights.",
      "It would be more correct to say duties.",
      "Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties.",
      "And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties, and quite legitimately.",
      "And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man.",
      "Quite so, Alexey Alexandrovitch assented.",
      "The question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.",
      "They will most likely be perfectly fitted, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when education has become general among them.",
      "We see this.... How about the proverb?",
      "said the prince, who had a long while been intent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling.",
      "I can say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is.... Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!",
      "said Pestsov angrily.",
      "What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties, said Sergey Ivanovitch, while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to avoid them.",
      "Duties are bound up with rights power, money, honor; those are what women are seeking, said Pestsov.",
      "Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take me, said the old prince.",
      "Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison.",
      "Even Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled.",
      "Yes, but a man can t nurse a baby, said Pestsov, while a woman.... No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship, said the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters.",
      "There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
      "put in Stepan Arkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind all along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.",
      "If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a sister s, where she might have found a woman s duties, Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of.",
      "But we take our stand on principle as the ideal, replied Pestsov in his mellow bass.",
      "Woman desires to have rights, to be independent, educated.",
      "She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities.",
      "And I m oppressed and humiliated that they won t engage me at the Foundling, the old prince said again, to the huge delight of Turovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce.",
      "Chapter 11 Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin.",
      "At first, when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another, there rose to Levin s mind what he had to say on the subject.",
      "But these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him.",
      "It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone.",
      "Kitty, too, should, one would have supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women.",
      "How often she had mused on the subject, thinking of her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of dependence, how often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did not marry, and how often she had argued with her sister about it!",
      "But it did not interest her at all.",
      "She and Levin had a conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.",
      "At first Levin, in answer to Kitty s question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her.",
      "It was very, very early in the morning.",
      "You were probably only just awake.",
      "Your mother was asleep in the corner.",
      "It was an exquisite morning.",
      "I was walking along wondering who it could be in a four-in-hand?",
      "It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window you were sitting like this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking awfully deeply about something, he said, smiling.",
      "How I should like to know what you were thinking about then!",
      "Something important?",
      "Wasn t I dreadfully untidy?",
      "she wondered, but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she had made had been very good.",
      "She blushed and laughed with delight; Really I don t remember.",
      "How nicely Turovtsin laughs!",
      "said Levin, admiring his moist eyes and shaking chest.",
      "Have you known him long?",
      "Oh, everyone knows him!",
      "And I see you think he s a horrid man?",
      "Not horrid, but nothing in him.",
      "Oh, you re wrong!",
      "And you must give up thinking so directly!",
      "I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he s an awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man.",
      "He has a heart of gold.",
      "How could you find out what sort of heart he has?",
      "We are great friends.",
      "I know him very well.",
      "Last winter, soon after ... you came to see us, she said, with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile, all Dolly s children had scarlet fever, and he happened to come and see her.",
      "And only fancy, she said in a whisper, he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children.",
      "Yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and looked after the children like a nurse.",
      "I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet fever, she said, bending over to her sister.",
      "Yes, it was wonderful, noble!",
      "said Dolly, glancing towards Turovtsin, who had become aware they were talking of him, and smiling gently to him.",
      "Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it was he had not realized all this man s goodness before.",
      "I m sorry, I m sorry, and I ll never think ill of people again!",
      "he said gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment.",
      "Chapter 12 Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies.",
      "Pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.",
      "When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did not follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound the chief ground of inequality.",
      "The inequality in marriage, in his opinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the infidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and by public opinion.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.",
      "No, I don t smoke, Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject, he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.",
      "I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things, he said, and would have gone on to the drawing-room.",
      "But at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?",
      "said Turovtsin, warmed up by the champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him.",
      "Vasya Pryatchnikov, he said, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red lips, addressing himself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch, they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has killed him.",
      "Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch s sore spot.",
      "He would again have got his brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself inquired, with curiosity: What did Pryatchnikov fight about?",
      "His wife.",
      "Acted like a man, he did!",
      "Called him out and shot him!",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting his eyebrows, he went into the drawing-room.",
      "How glad I am you have come, Dolly said with a frightened smile, meeting him in the outer drawing-room.",
      "I must talk to you.",
      "Let s sit here.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given him by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna, and smiled affectedly.",
      "It s fortunate, said he, especially as I was meaning to ask you to excuse me, and to be taking leave.",
      "I have to start tomorrow.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna s innocence, and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, she said, with desperate resolution looking him in the face, I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer.",
      "How is she?",
      "She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna, replied Alexey Alexandrovitch, not looking at her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna as a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you?",
      "what fault do you find with her?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his head.",
      "I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "he said, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure Shtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing-room.",
      "I don t believe it, I don t believe it, I can t believe it!",
      "Dolly said, clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture.",
      "She rose quickly, and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch s sleeve.",
      "We shall be disturbed here.",
      "Come this way, please.",
      "Dolly s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom.",
      "They sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.",
      "I don t, I don t believe it!",
      "Dolly said, trying to catch his glance that avoided her.",
      "One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna, said he, with an emphasis on the word facts.",
      "But what has she done?",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "What precisely has she done?",
      "She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband.",
      "That s what she has done, said he.",
      "No, no, it can t be!",
      "No, for God s sake, you are mistaken, said Dolly, putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this warm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound.",
      "He began to speak with greater heat.",
      "It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life, and a son, all that s a mistake, and that she wants to begin life again, he said angrily, with a snort.",
      "Anna and sin I cannot connect them, I cannot believe it!",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, he said, now looking straight into Dolly s kindly, troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself, I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible.",
      "When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was better than now.",
      "When I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope, and still I doubt of everything.",
      "I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my son, and sometimes do not believe he is my son.",
      "I am very unhappy.",
      "He had no need to say that.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him, and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter.",
      "Oh, this is awful, awful!",
      "But can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce?",
      "I am resolved on extreme measures.",
      "There is nothing else for me to do.",
      "Nothing else to do, nothing else to do.... she replied, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Oh no, don t say nothing else to do!",
      "What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in any other in loss, in death bear one s trouble in peace, but that one must act, said he, as though guessing her thought.",
      "One must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can t live _ trois_.",
      "I understand, I quite understand that, said Dolly, and her head sank.",
      "She was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own grief in her family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture.",
      "But wait a little!",
      "You are a Christian.",
      "Think of her!",
      "What will become of her, if you cast her off?",
      "I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great deal, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "His face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes looked straight before him.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart.",
      "That was what I did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old.",
      "I gave her a chance to reform, I tried to save her.",
      "And with what result?",
      "She would not regard the slightest request that she should observe decorum, he said, getting heated.",
      "One may save anyone who does not want to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt, so depraved, that ruin itself seems to be her salvation, what s to be done?",
      "Anything, only not divorce!",
      "answered Darya Alexandrovna But what is anything?",
      "No, it is awful!",
      "She will be no one s wife, she will be lost!",
      "What can I do?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his shoulders and his eyebrows.",
      "The recollection of his wife s last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid, as at the beginning of the conversation.",
      "I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I must be going, he said, getting up.",
      "No, wait a minute.",
      "You must not ruin her.",
      "Wait a little; I will tell you about myself.",
      "I was married, and my husband deceived me; in anger and jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would myself....",
      "But I came to myself again; and who did it?",
      "Anna saved me.",
      "And here I am living on.",
      "The children are growing up, my husband has come back to his family, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better, and I live on....",
      "I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her, but her words had no effect on him now.",
      "All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul.",
      "He shook himself, and said in a shrill, loud voice: Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong.",
      "I have done everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin.",
      "I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated anyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive her, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me!",
      "he said, with tones of hatred in his voice.",
      "Love those that hate you.... Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously.",
      "That he knew long ago, but it could not be applied to his case.",
      "Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.",
      "Forgive me for having troubled you.",
      "Everyone has enough to bear in his own grief!",
      "And regaining his self-possession, Alexey Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away.",
      "Chapter 13 When they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into the drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too obviously paying her attention.",
      "He remained in the little ring of men, taking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty, he was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was in the drawing-room.",
      "He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men, and to like everyone always.",
      "The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle, called by him the choral principle.",
      "Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who had a special attitude of his own, both admitting and not admitting the significance of the Russian commune.",
      "But he talked to them, simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences.",
      "He was not in the least interested in what he said himself, and even less so in what they said; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented.",
      "He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing was at first there, in the drawing-room, and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door.",
      "Without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.",
      "She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him.",
      "I thought you were going towards the piano, said he, going up to her.",
      "That s something I miss in the country music.",
      "No; we only came to fetch you and thank you, she said, rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, for coming.",
      "What do they want to argue for?",
      "No one ever convinces anyone, you know.",
      "Yes; that s true, said Levin; it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can t make out what one s opponent wants to prove.",
      "Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked.",
      "He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.",
      "Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing at last what he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position.",
      "He tried to say this.",
      "She knitted her brow, trying to understand.",
      "But directly he began to illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.",
      "I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to him, then one can.... She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.",
      "Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.",
      "Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth.",
      "They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women.",
      "Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman s duties in a family.",
      "He supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations or hired.",
      "No, said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes; a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation, while she herself.... At the hint he understood her.",
      "Oh, yes, he said.",
      "Yes, yes, yes you re right; you re right!",
      "And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid s existence and its humiliation in Kitty s heart; and loving her, he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.",
      "A silence followed.",
      "She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.",
      "Her eyes were shining with a soft light.",
      "Under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness.",
      "I ve scribbled all over the table!",
      "she said, and, laying down the chalk, she made a movement as though to get up.",
      "shall I be left alone without her?",
      "he thought with horror, and he took the chalk.",
      "Wait a minute, he said, sitting down to the table.",
      "I ve long wanted to ask you one thing.",
      "He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.",
      "Please, ask it.",
      "Here, he said; and he wrote the initial letters, _w, y, t, m, i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t_.",
      "These letters meant, When you told me it could never be, did that mean never, or then?",
      "There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words.",
      "She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read.",
      "Once or twice she stole a look at him, as though asking him, Is it what I think?",
      "I understand, she said, flushing a little.",
      "What is this word?",
      "he said, pointing to the _n_ that stood for _never_.",
      "It means _never_, she said; but that s not true!",
      "He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood up.",
      "She wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.",
      "Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.",
      "He was suddenly radiant: he had understood.",
      "It meant, Then I could not answer differently.",
      "He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.",
      "Only then?",
      "Yes, her smile answered.",
      "And n... and now?",
      "Well, read this.",
      "I ll tell you what I should like should like so much!",
      "she wrote the initial letters, _i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h._ This meant, If you could forget and forgive what happened.",
      "He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, I have nothing to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.",
      "She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.",
      "I understand, she said in a whisper.",
      "He sat down and wrote a long phrase.",
      "She understood it all, and without asking him, Is it this?",
      "took the chalk and at once answered.",
      "For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and often looked into her eyes.",
      "He was stupefied with happiness.",
      "He could not supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with happiness, he saw all he needed to know.",
      "And he wrote three letters.",
      "But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and herself finished and wrote the answer, Yes.",
      "You re playing _secr taire_?",
      "said the old prince.",
      "But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.",
      "Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.",
      "In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning.",
      "Chapter 14 When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her.",
      "It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left alone, to kill time.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a _soir e_, in reality to the ballet.",
      "Levin only had time to tell him he was happy, and that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he had done for him.",
      "The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.",
      "Oh, so it s not time to die yet?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing Levin s hand with emotion.",
      "N-n-no!",
      "Darya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of congratulation, saying, How glad I am you have met Kitty again!",
      "One must value old friends.",
      "Levin did not like these words of Darya Alexandrovna s. She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it.",
      "Levin said good-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his brother.",
      "Where are you going?",
      "I m going to a meeting.",
      "Well, I ll come with you.",
      "May I?",
      "Yes, come along, said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling.",
      "What is the matter with you today?",
      "Happiness is the matter with me!",
      "said Levin, letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in.",
      "You don t mind?",
      "it s so stifling.",
      "It s happiness is the matter with me!",
      "Why is it you have never married?",
      "I am very glad, she seems a nice gi.... Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning.",
      "Don t say it!",
      "shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in it.",
      "She s a nice girl were such simple, humble words, so out of harmony with his feeling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with him.",
      "Well, anyway, I may say that I m very glad of it.",
      "That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more!",
      "Nothing, nothing, silence, said Levin, and muffling him once more in his fur coat, he added: I do like you so!",
      "Well, is it possible for me to be present at the meeting?",
      "What is your discussion about today?",
      "asked Levin, never ceasing smiling.",
      "They arrived at the meeting.",
      "Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw from this secretary s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person he was.",
      "This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes.",
      "Then the discussion began.",
      "They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully.",
      "And then Sviazhsky (he was there too) said something too, very handsomely and nobly.",
      "Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them.",
      "They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying it.",
      "What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart.",
      "And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day.",
      "That was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him.",
      "Well, did you like it?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.",
      "Very much.",
      "I never supposed it was so interesting!",
      "Capital!",
      "Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him.",
      "Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him.",
      "He was a clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.",
      "Most delighted, he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.",
      "And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the idea of Sviazhsky s sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.",
      "Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate, presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least annoy Levin.",
      "On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view.",
      "The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful.",
      "It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy.",
      "He stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.",
      "Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in.",
      "It was past one o clock.",
      "Levin went back to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through.",
      "The servant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and would have gone away, but Levin stopped him.",
      "This servant, Yegor, whom Levin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent, and, above all, good-hearted man.",
      "Well, Yegor, it s hard work not sleeping, isn t it?",
      "One s got to put up with it!",
      "It s part of our work, you see.",
      "In a gentleman s house it s easier; but then here one makes more.",
      "It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler s shop.",
      "Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in marriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.",
      "Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin s idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin s surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman.",
      "Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!",
      "thought Levin.",
      "Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your wife?",
      "Ay!",
      "and why not?",
      "responded Yegor.",
      "And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions.",
      "My life, too, has been a wonderful one.",
      "From a child up.... he was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin s enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning.",
      "But at that moment a ring was heard.",
      "Yegor departed, and Levin was left alone.",
      "He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and supper at Sviazhsky s, but he was incapable of thinking of supper.",
      "He had not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of sleep either.",
      "His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat.",
      "He opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes.",
      "Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of Charles s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella.",
      "He gazed at the cross, then at the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room, and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination.",
      "At four o clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door.",
      "It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from the club.",
      "He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing.",
      "Poor, unlucky fellow!",
      "thought Levin, and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man.",
      "He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star.",
      "At seven o clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors, and bells ringing in some servants department, and Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen.",
      "He closed the pane, washed, dressed, and went out into the street.",
      "Chapter 15 The streets were still empty.",
      "Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys.",
      "The visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep.",
      "He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.",
      "The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him.",
      "Levin would have entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the servant, and he went out.",
      "Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll.",
      "Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for a walk.",
      "It was nine o clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys steps the second time.",
      "In the house they were only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing.",
      "He had to get through at least two hours more.",
      "All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life.",
      "He had eaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his body; he moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do anything.",
      "He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if need be.",
      "He spent the remainder of the time in the street, incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him.",
      "And what he saw then, he never saw again after.",
      "The children especially going to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an unseen hand, touched him.",
      "Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys were not earthly creatures.",
      "It all happened at the same time: a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of her wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that quivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of fresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out.",
      "All of this together was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.",
      "Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back again to the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to wait for twelve o clock.",
      "In the next room they were talking about some sort of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs.",
      "They did not realize that the hand was near twelve.",
      "The hand reached it.",
      "Levin went out onto the steps.",
      "The sledge-drivers clearly knew all about it.",
      "They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among themselves, and offering their services.",
      "Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys .",
      "The sledge-driver was splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong, full-blooded red neck.",
      "The sledge was high and comfortable, and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after, and the horse was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn t seem to move.",
      "The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys house, and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a Wo!",
      "especially indicative of respect for his fare.",
      "The Shtcherbatskys hall-porter certainly knew all about it.",
      "This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said: Well, it s a long while since you ve been to see us, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "Not only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy.",
      "Looking into his kindly old eyes, Levin realized even something new in his happiness.",
      "Are they up?",
      "Pray walk in!",
      "Leave it here, said he, smiling, as Levin would have come back to take his hat.",
      "That meant something.",
      "To whom shall I announce your honor?",
      "asked the footman.",
      "The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen, a dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all about it.",
      "The princess ... the prince ... the young princess.... said Levin.",
      "The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon.",
      "She walked across the room, and her ringlets and her face were beaming.",
      "He had only just spoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin s eyes, and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness.",
      "Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door.",
      "Directly she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the parquet, and his bliss, his life, himself what was best in himself, what he had so long sought and longed for was quickly, so quickly approaching him.",
      "She did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to float to him.",
      "He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart.",
      "Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love.",
      "She stopped still close to him, touching him.",
      "Her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders.",
      "She had done all she could she had run up to him and given herself up entirely, shy and happy.",
      "He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss.",
      "She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the morning.",
      "Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in her happiness.",
      "She had been waiting for him.",
      "She wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his.",
      "She had got ready to see him alone, and had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and did not know herself what she was doing.",
      "She had heard his steps and voice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.",
      "Mademoiselle Linon had gone away.",
      "Without thinking, without asking herself how and what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.",
      "Let us go to mamma!",
      "she said, taking him by the hand.",
      "For a long while he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time he tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up.",
      "He took her hand and kissed it.",
      "Can it be true?",
      "he said at last in a choked voice.",
      "I can t believe you love me, dear!",
      "She smiled at that dear, and at the timidity with which he glanced at her.",
      "Yes!",
      "she said significantly, deliberately.",
      "I am so happy!",
      "Not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room.",
      "The princess, seeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not expected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his cheeks with her tears.",
      "So it is all settled!",
      "I am glad.",
      "Love her.",
      "I am glad.... Kitty!",
      "You ve not been long settling things, said the old prince, trying to seem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him.",
      "I ve long, always wished for this!",
      "said the prince, taking Levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself.",
      "Even when this little feather-head fancied.... Papa!",
      "shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.",
      "Well, I won t!",
      "I m very, very ... plea... Oh, what a fool I am....",
      "He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made the sign of the cross over her.",
      "And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then so little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his muscular hand.",
      "Chapter 16 The princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat down beside her.",
      "Kitty stood by her father s chair, still holding his hand.",
      "All were silent.",
      "The princess was the first to put everything into words, and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions.",
      "And all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.",
      "When is it to be?",
      "We must have the benediction and announcement.",
      "And when s the wedding to be?",
      "What do you think, Alexander?",
      "Here he is, said the old prince, pointing to Levin he s the principal person in the matter.",
      "said Levin blushing.",
      "Tomorrow.",
      "If you ask me, I should say, the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.",
      "Come, _mon cher_, that s nonsense!",
      "Well, in a week.",
      "He s quite mad.",
      "No, why so?",
      "Well, upon my word!",
      "said the mother, smiling, delighted at this haste.",
      "How about the trousseau?",
      "Will there really be a trousseau and all that?",
      "Levin thought with horror.",
      "But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that can it spoil my happiness?",
      "Nothing can spoil it!",
      "He glanced at Kitty, and noticed that she was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed by the idea of the trousseau.",
      "Then it must be all right, he thought.",
      "Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like, he said apologetically.",
      "We ll talk it over, then.",
      "The benediction and announcement can take place now.",
      "That s very well.",
      "The princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone away, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover, kissed her several times, smiling.",
      "The old people were obviously muddled for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter.",
      "When the prince and the princess had gone, Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand.",
      "He was self-possessed now and could speak, and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her.",
      "But he said not at all what he had to say.",
      "How I knew it would be so!",
      "I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I was always sure, he said.",
      "I believe that it was ordained.",
      "And I!",
      "Even when.... She stopped and went on again, looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes, Even when I thrust from me my happiness.",
      "I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.",
      "I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?",
      "Perhaps it was for the best.",
      "You will have to forgive me so much.",
      "I ought to tell you....",
      "This was one of the things he had meant to speak about.",
      "He had resolved from the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she was, and that he was not a believer.",
      "It was agonizing, but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts.",
      "No, not now, later!",
      "Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me.",
      "I m not afraid of anything.",
      "I want to know everything.",
      "Now it is settled.",
      "He added: Settled that you ll take me whatever I may be you won t give me up?",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.",
      "Before she had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.",
      "Then relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding.",
      "Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort, but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing.",
      "He felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what, he did not know; and he did everything he was told, and it all gave him happiness.",
      "He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did, and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever happened.",
      "Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat, said Mademoiselle Linon and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats.",
      "Well, I m very glad, said Sviazhsky.",
      "I advise you to get the bouquets from Fomin s. Oh, are they wanted?",
      "And he drove to Fomin s. His brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many expenses, presents to give.... Oh, are presents wanted?",
      "And he galloped to Foulde s. And at the confectioner s, and at Fomin s, and at Foulde s he saw that he was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided themselves on his happiness, just as everyone whom he had to do with during those days.",
      "What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous, were enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection.",
      "Kitty too felt the same thing.",
      "When Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better, Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to admit it, and in Kitty s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration.",
      "The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time.",
      "He consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his diary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him.",
      "He had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife.",
      "Two things caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith.",
      "His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed.",
      "She was religious, had never doubted the truths of religion, but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least.",
      "Through love she knew all his soul, and in his soul she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account.",
      "The other confession set her weeping bitterly.",
      "Levin, not without an inner struggle, handed her his diary.",
      "He knew that between him and her there could not be, and should not be, secrets, and so he had decided that so it must be.",
      "But he had not realized what an effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in her place.",
      "It was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater, went into her room and saw her tear-stained, pitiful, sweet face, miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo, he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity, and was appalled at what he had done.",
      "Take them, take these dreadful books!",
      "she said, pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table.",
      "Why did you give them me?",
      "No, it was better anyway, she added, touched by his despairing face.",
      "But it s awful, awful!",
      "His head sank, and he was silent.",
      "He could say nothing.",
      "You can t forgive me, he whispered.",
      "Yes, I forgive you; but it s terrible!",
      "But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it, it only added another shade to it.",
      "She forgave him; but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her, morally bowed down lower than ever before her, and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness.",
      "Chapter 17 Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna s words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance.",
      "The applicability or non-applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative.",
      "Of all that had been said, what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid, good-natured Turovtsin _Acted like a man, he did!",
      "Called him out and shot him!_ Everyone had apparently shared this feeling, though from politeness they had not expressed it.",
      "But the matter is settled, it s useless thinking about it, Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.",
      "And thinking of nothing but the journey before him, and the revision work he had to do, he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was.",
      "The porter said that the man had only just gone out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him, sat down to the table, and taking the guidebook, began considering the route of his journey.",
      "Two telegrams, said his manservant, coming into the room.",
      "I beg your pardon, your excellency; I d only just that minute gone out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them.",
      "The first telegram was the announcement of Stremov s appointment to the very post Karenin had coveted.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down, and flushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.",
      "_Quos vult perdere dementat_, he said, meaning by _quos_ the persons responsible for this appointment.",
      "He was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post, that he had been conspicuously passed over; but it was incomprehensible, amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it.",
      "How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their _prestige_ by this appointment?",
      "Something else in the same line, he said to himself bitterly, opening the second telegram.",
      "The telegram was from his wife.",
      "Her name, written in blue pencil, Anna, was the first thing that caught his eye.",
      "I am dying; I beg, I implore you to come.",
      "I shall die easier with your forgiveness, he read.",
      "He smiled contemptuously, and flung down the telegram.",
      "That this was a trick and a fraud, of that, he thought for the first minute, there could be no doubt.",
      "There is no deceit she would stick at.",
      "She was near her confinement.",
      "Perhaps it is the confinement.",
      "But what can be their aim?",
      "To legitimize the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce, he thought.",
      "But something was said in it: I am dying....",
      "He read the telegram again, and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him.",
      "And if it is true?",
      "If it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent, and I, taking it for a trick, refuse to go?",
      "That would not only be cruel, and everyone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.",
      "Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg, he said to his servant.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see his wife.",
      "If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing and go away again.",
      "If she was really in danger, and wished to see him before her death, he would forgive her if he found her alive, and pay her the last duties if he came too late.",
      "All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.",
      "With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him, not thinking of what was awaiting him.",
      "He could not think about it, because in picturing what would happen, he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.",
      "Bakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and yet was hoping for.",
      "He drove up to the steps.",
      "A sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance.",
      "As he went into the entry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly.",
      "Its meaning ran: If it s a trick, then calm contempt and departure.",
      "If truth, do what is proper.",
      "The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang.",
      "The porter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in slippers.",
      "How is your mistress?",
      "A successful confinement yesterday.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white.",
      "He felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death.",
      "And how is she?",
      "Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs.",
      "Very ill, he answered.",
      "There was a consultation yesterday, and the doctor s here now.",
      "Take my things, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death, he went into the hall.",
      "On the hatstand there was a military overcoat.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked: Who is here?",
      "The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.",
      "In the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.",
      "She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom.",
      "Thank God you ve come!",
      "She keeps on about you and nothing but you, she said.",
      "Make haste with the ice!",
      "the doctor s peremptory voice said from the bedroom.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.",
      "At the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face hidden in his hands, weeping.",
      "He jumped up at the doctor s voice, took his hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Seeing the husband, he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head down to his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an effort over himself, got up and said: She is dying.",
      "The doctors say there is no hope.",
      "I am entirely in your power, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal.",
      "I.... Alexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky s tears, felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people s suffering, and turning away his face, he moved hurriedly to the door, without hearing the rest of his words.",
      "From the bedroom came the sound of Anna s voice saying something.",
      "Her voice was lively, eager, with exceedingly distinct intonations.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom, and went up to the bed.",
      "She was lying turned with her face towards him.",
      "Her cheeks were flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt, twisting it about.",
      "It seemed as though she were not only well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind.",
      "She was talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation.",
      "For Alexey I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a strange and awful thing that both are Alexey, isn t it?)",
      "Alexey would not refuse me.",
      "I should forget, he would forgive....",
      "But why doesn t he come?",
      "He s so good he doesn t know himself how good he is.",
      "Ah, my God, what agony!",
      "Give me some water, quick!",
      "Oh, that will be bad for her, my little girl!",
      "Oh, very well then, give her to a nurse.",
      "Yes, I agree, it s better in fact.",
      "He ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her.",
      "Give her to the nurse.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, he has come.",
      "said the midwife, trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Anna went on, not seeing her husband.",
      "No, give her to me; give me my little one!",
      "He has not come yet.",
      "You say he won t forgive me, because you don t know him.",
      "No one knows him.",
      "I m the only one, and it was hard for me even.",
      "His eyes I ought to know Seryozha has just the same eyes and I can t bear to see them because of it.",
      "Has Seryozha had his dinner?",
      "I know everyone will forget him.",
      "He would not forget.",
      "Seryozha must be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must be asked to sleep with him.",
      "All of a sudden she shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though expecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised her hands to her face.",
      "She had seen her husband.",
      "No, no!",
      "she began.",
      "I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of death.",
      "Alexey, come here.",
      "I am in a hurry, because I ve no time, I ve not long left to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand nothing more.",
      "Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he took her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could not utter it; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling with his emotion, and only now and then glanced at her.",
      "And each time he glanced at her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.",
      "Wait a minute, you don t know ... stay a little, stay!...",
      "She stopped, as though collecting her ideas.",
      "Yes, she began; yes, yes, yes.",
      "This is what I wanted to say.",
      "Don t be surprised at me.",
      "I m still the same....",
      "But there is another woman in me, I m afraid of her: she loved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her that used to be.",
      "I m not that woman.",
      "Now I m my real self, all myself.",
      "I m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him.",
      "Even now I feel see here, the weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers.",
      "My fingers see how huge they are!",
      "But this will soon all be over.... Only one thing I want: forgive me, forgive me quite.",
      "I m terrible, but my nurse used to tell me; the holy martyr what was her name?",
      "She was worse.",
      "And I ll go to Rome; there s a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to anyone, only I ll take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can t forgive me!",
      "I know, it can t be forgiven!",
      "No, no, go away, you re too good!",
      "She held his hand in one burning hand, while she pushed him away with the other.",
      "The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it.",
      "He suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known.",
      "He did not think that the Christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow, enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart.",
      "He knelt down, and laying his head in the curve of her arm, which burned him as with fire through the sleeve, he sobbed like a little child.",
      "She put her arm around his head, moved towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes.",
      "That is he.",
      "I knew him!",
      "Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...",
      "They ve come again; why don t they go away?...",
      "Oh, take these cloaks off me!",
      "The doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, and covered her up to the shoulders.",
      "She lay back submissively, and looked before her with beaming eyes.",
      "Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want nothing more.... Why doesn t _he_ come?",
      "she said, turning to the door towards Vronsky.",
      "Do come, do come!",
      "Give him your hand.",
      "Vronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again hid his face in his hands.",
      "Uncover your face look at him!",
      "He s a saint, she said.",
      "uncover your face, do uncover it!",
      "she said angrily.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, do uncover his face!",
      "I want to see him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky s hands and drew them away from his face, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it.",
      "Forgive him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes.",
      "Thank God, thank God!",
      "she said, now everything is ready.",
      "Only to stretch my legs a little.",
      "There, that s capital.",
      "How badly these flowers are done not a bit like a violet, she said, pointing to the hangings.",
      "My God, my God!",
      "when will it end?",
      "Give me some morphine.",
      "Doctor, give me some morphine!",
      "Oh, my God, my God!",
      "And she tossed about on the bed.",
      "The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was ninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death.",
      "The whole day long there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness.",
      "At midnight the patient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.",
      "The end was expected every minute.",
      "Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, and Alexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall, said: Better stay, she might ask for you, and himself led him to his wife s boudoir.",
      "Towards morning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid thought and talk, and again it ended in unconsciousness.",
      "On the third day it was the same thing, and the doctors said there was hope.",
      "That day Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting, and closing the door sat down opposite him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, said Vronsky, feeling that a statement of the position was coming, I can t speak, I can t understand.",
      "Spare me!",
      "However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.",
      "He would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said: I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary.",
      "I must explain my feelings, the feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not be in error regarding me.",
      "You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had even begun to take proceedings.",
      "I won t conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her.",
      "When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say more, I longed for her death.",
      "He paused, pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him.",
      "But I saw her and forgave her.",
      "And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty.",
      "I forgive completely.",
      "I would offer the other cheek, I would give my cloak if my coat be taken.",
      "I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness!",
      "Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them impressed Vronsky.",
      "This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never utter a word of reproach to you, Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.",
      "My duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I will be.",
      "If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away.",
      "He got up, and sobs cut short his words.",
      "Vronsky too was getting up, and in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him from under his brows.",
      "He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch s feeling, but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life.",
      "Chapter 18 After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out onto the steps of the Karenins house and stood still, with difficulty remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive.",
      "He felt disgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation.",
      "He felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then.",
      "All the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm, had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable.",
      "The betrayed husband, who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her herself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not ludicrous, but kind and straightforward and large.",
      "Vronsky could not but feel this, and the parts were suddenly reversed.",
      "Vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement, his truth and his own falsehood.",
      "He felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow, while he had been base and petty in his deceit.",
      "But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery.",
      "He felt unutterably wretched now, for his passion for Anna, which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler, now that he knew he had lost her forever, was stronger than ever it had been.",
      "He had seen all of her in her illness, had come to know her very soul, and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then.",
      "And now when he had learned to know her, to love her as she should be loved, he had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever, leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory.",
      "Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face.",
      "He stood on the steps of the Karenins house like one distraught, and did not know what to do.",
      "A sledge, sir?",
      "asked the porter.",
      "Yes, a sledge.",
      "On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without undressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying his head on them.",
      "His head was heavy.",
      "Images, memories, and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness.",
      "First it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife s white hands, then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed.",
      "To sleep!",
      "To forget!",
      "he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to sleep at once.",
      "And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness.",
      "The waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, when all at once it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him.",
      "He started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees.",
      "His eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep.",
      "The heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone.",
      "You may trample me in the mud, he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch s words and saw him standing before him, and saw Anna s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw his own, as he fancied, foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face.",
      "He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes.",
      "he repeated to himself.",
      "But with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races.",
      "That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her memory.",
      "But I cannot live without it.",
      "How can we be reconciled?",
      "he said aloud, and unconsciously began to repeat these words.",
      "This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories, which he felt were thronging in his brain.",
      "But repeating words did not check his imagination for long.",
      "Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind, and then his recent humiliation.",
      "Take away his hands, Anna s voice says.",
      "He takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face.",
      "He still lay down, trying to sleep, though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images.",
      "He listened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated: I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.",
      "I did not appreciate it, did not make enough of it.",
      "Am I going out of my mind?",
      "What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?",
      "he answered himself, and opening his eyes, he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him, worked by Varya, his brother s wife.",
      "He touched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when he had seen her last.",
      "But to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort.",
      "No, I must sleep!",
      "He moved the cushion up, and pressed his head into it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut.",
      "He jumped up and sat down.",
      "That s all over for me, he said to himself.",
      "I must think what to do.",
      "What is left?",
      "His mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of Anna.",
      "Ambition?",
      "Serpuhovskoy?",
      "Society?",
      "The court?",
      "He could not come to a pause anywhere.",
      "All of it had had meaning before, but now there was no reality in it.",
      "He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his belt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up and down the room.",
      "This is how people go mad, he repeated, and how they shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation, he added slowly.",
      "He went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him, turned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought.",
      "For two minutes, his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought, he stood with the revolver in his hand, motionless, thinking.",
      "Of course, he said to himself, as though a logical, continuous, and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion.",
      "In reality this of course, that seemed convincing to him, was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour memories of happiness lost forever.",
      "There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of humiliation.",
      "Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same.",
      "Of course, he repeated, when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images, and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest, and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in his fist, he pulled the trigger.",
      "He did not hear the sound of the shot, but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling.",
      "He tried to clutch at the edge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on the ground, looking about him in astonishment.",
      "He did not recognize his room, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the wastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug.",
      "The hurried, creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing-room brought him to his senses.",
      "He made an effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the floor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his arm, he knew he had shot himself.",
      "Idiotic!",
      "Missed!",
      "he said, fumbling after the revolver.",
      "The revolver was close beside him he sought further off.",
      "Still feeling for it, he stretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough to keep his balance, fell over, streaming with blood.",
      "The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, was so panic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor, that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance.",
      "An hour later Varya, his brother s wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three doctors, whom she had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared at the same moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him.",
      "Chapter 19 The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for seeing his wife, he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere, and he might forgive her, and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him in all its significance.",
      "But the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency, but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife, he had not known his own heart.",
      "At his sick wife s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others, and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness.",
      "And pity for her, and remorse for having desired her death, and most of all, the joy of forgiveness, made him at once conscious, not simply of the relief of his own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before.",
      "He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy; that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging, blaming, and hating, had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved.",
      "He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.",
      "He forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after reports reached him of his despairing action.",
      "He felt more for his son than before.",
      "And he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him.",
      "But for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity, only, but of tenderness.",
      "At first, from a feeling of compassion alone, he had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was not his child, and who was cast on one side during her mother s illness, and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her, and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her.",
      "He would go into the nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long while, so that the nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite used to his presence.",
      "Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the sleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the fat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes and nose.",
      "At such moments particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing extraordinary in his position, nothing that ought to be changed.",
      "But as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed to remain in it.",
      "He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful, or more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for.",
      "He felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood, and that something was expected of him.",
      "Above all, he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.",
      "When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away, Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him, ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face.",
      "She seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him something; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she seemed to be expecting something from him.",
      "Towards the end of February it happened that Anna s baby daughter, who had been named Anna too, fell ill. Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for, he went to his office.",
      "On finishing his work, he returned home at four.",
      "Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.",
      "Who is here?",
      "asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya, the groom answered, and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.",
      "During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest in him and his wife.",
      "All these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer s eyes, and just now in the eyes of this groom.",
      "Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had just been at a wedding.",
      "When they met him, with ill-disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife s health.",
      "The presence of Princess Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her, and also because he disliked her, and he went straight to the nursery.",
      "In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the table with his legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.",
      "The English governess, who had during Anna s illness replaced the French one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl.",
      "She hurriedly got up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son s hair, answered the governess s inquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor had said of the baby.",
      "The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.",
      "But she is still in pain, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, listening to the baby s screaming in the next room.",
      "I think it s the wet-nurse, sir, the Englishwoman said firmly.",
      "What makes you think so?",
      "he asked, stopping short.",
      "It s just as it was at Countess Paul s, sir.",
      "They gave the baby medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse had no milk, sir.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door.",
      "The baby was lying with its head thrown back, stiffening itself in the nurse s arms, and would not take the plump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending over her.",
      "Still no better?",
      "She s very restless, answered the nurse in a whisper.",
      "Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk, he said.",
      "I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Then why didn t you say so?",
      "Who s one to say it to?",
      "Anna Arkadyevna still ill.... said the nurse discontentedly.",
      "The nurse was an old servant of the family.",
      "And in her simple words there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.",
      "The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing.",
      "The nurse, with a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse s arms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.",
      "You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse, frightened at the idea of losing her place, muttered something to herself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk.",
      "In that smile, too, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.",
      "Luckless child!",
      "said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking up and down with it.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro.",
      "When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and the nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the baby.",
      "For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out of the room.",
      "In the dining-room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor.",
      "He felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy.",
      "But his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so, overcoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom.",
      "As he walked over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear.",
      "If he hadn t been going away, I could have understood your answer and his too.",
      "But your husband ought to be above that, Betsy was saying.",
      "It s not for my husband; for myself I don t wish it.",
      "Don t say that!",
      "answered Anna s excited voice.",
      "Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself on your account.... That s just why I don t want to.",
      "With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved.",
      "But reflecting that this would be undignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up to the bedroom.",
      "The voices were silent, and he went in.",
      "Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee.",
      "The eagerness died out of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy.",
      "Betsy, dressed in the height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt, was sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect.",
      "Bowing her head, she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.",
      "she said, as though surprised.",
      "I m very glad you re at home.",
      "You never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven t seen you ever since Anna has been ill.",
      "I have heard all about it your anxiety.",
      "Yes, you re a wonderful husband!",
      "she said, with a meaning and affable air, as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife s hand, asked how she was.",
      "Better, I think, she said, avoiding his eyes.",
      "But you ve rather a feverish-looking color, he said, laying stress on the word feverish.",
      "We ve been talking too much, said Betsy.",
      "I feel it s selfishness on my part, and I am going away.",
      "She got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her hand.",
      "No, wait a minute, please.",
      "I must tell you ... no, you.",
      "she turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson.",
      "I won t and can t keep anything secret from you, she said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.",
      "Betsy s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say good-bye before his departure for Tashkend.",
      "She did not look at her husband, and was evidently in haste to have everything out, however hard it might be for her.",
      "I told her I could not receive him.",
      "You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch, Betsy corrected her.",
      "Oh, no, I can t receive him; and what object would there.... She stopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her husband (he did not look at her).",
      "In short, I don t wish it.... Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.",
      "Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand.",
      "I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but.... he said, feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya, who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world, and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness.",
      "He stopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.",
      "Well, good-bye, my darling, said Betsy, getting up.",
      "She kissed Anna, and went out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.",
      "I know you are a truly magnanimous man, said Betsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more.",
      "I am an outsider, but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise.",
      "Receive him.",
      "Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor, and he is going away to Tashkend.",
      "Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice.",
      "But the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.",
      "He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity in his position.",
      "And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase.",
      "Chapter 20 Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room, and went to his wife.",
      "She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him.",
      "He saw she had been crying.",
      "I am very grateful for your confidence in me.",
      "He repeated gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy s presence in French, and sat down beside her.",
      "When he spoke to her in Russian, using the Russian thou of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to Anna.",
      "And I am very grateful for your decision.",
      "I, too, imagine that since he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here.",
      "However, if....",
      "But I ve said so already, so why repeat it?",
      "Anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing.",
      "No sort of necessity, she thought, for a man to come and say good-bye to the woman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself, and who cannot live without him.",
      "No sort of necessity!",
      "she compressed her lips, and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins.",
      "They were rubbing each other.",
      "Let us never speak of it, she added more calmly.",
      "I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to see.... Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.",
      "That my wish coincides with your own, she finished quickly, exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say.",
      "Yes, he assented; and Princess Tverskaya s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for.",
      "She especially....",
      "I don t believe a word of what s said about her, said Anna quickly.",
      "I know she really cares for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing.",
      "She played nervously with the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself, though she could not control it.",
      "Her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence.",
      "I have just sent for the doctor, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?",
      "No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn t enough milk.",
      "Why didn t you let me nurse her, when I begged to?",
      "Anyway (Alexey Alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that anyway ), she s a baby, and they re killing her.",
      "She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her.",
      "I begged to nurse her, I wasn t allowed to, and now I m blamed for it.",
      "I don t blame....",
      "Yes, you do blame me!",
      "why didn t I die!",
      "And she broke into sobs.",
      "Forgive me, I m nervous, I m unjust, she said, controlling herself, but do go away.... No, it can t go on like this, Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife s room.",
      "Never had the impossibility of his position in the world s eyes, and his wife s hatred of him, and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations, and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife, been presented to him with such distinctness as that day.",
      "He saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something, but what exactly, he could not make out.",
      "He felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement.",
      "He believed that for Anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they all thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position.",
      "Bad as this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him of everything he cared for.",
      "But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone was against him, and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong, though it seemed the proper thing to them.",
      "Chapter 21 Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she was met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from Yeliseev s, where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.",
      "princess!",
      "what a delightful meeting!",
      "he began.",
      "I ve been to see you.",
      "A meeting for one minute, for I m going, said Betsy, smiling and putting on her glove.",
      "Don t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand.",
      "There s nothing I m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand.",
      "He kissed Betsy s hand.",
      "When shall we see each other?",
      "You don t deserve it, answered Betsy, smiling.",
      "Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I ve become a most serious person.",
      "I don t only manage my own affairs, but other people s too, he said, with a significant expression.",
      "Oh, I m so glad!",
      "answered Betsy, at once understanding that he was speaking of Anna.",
      "And going back into the drawing-room, they stood in a corner.",
      "He s killing her, said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.",
      "It s impossible, impossible....",
      "I m so glad you think so, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression, that s what I ve come to Petersburg for.",
      "The whole town s talking of it, she said.",
      "It s an impossible position.",
      "She pines and pines away.",
      "He doesn t understand that she s one of those women who can t trifle with their feelings.",
      "One of two things: either let him take her away, act with energy, or give her a divorce.",
      "This is stifling her.",
      "Yes, yes ... just so.... Oblonsky said, sighing.",
      "That s what I ve come for.",
      "At least not solely for that ...",
      "I ve been made a _Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you.",
      "But the chief thing was having to settle this.",
      "Well, God help you!",
      "After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her hand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister.",
      "He found her in tears.",
      "Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic, poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood.",
      "He asked her how she was, and how she had spent the morning.",
      "Very, very miserably.",
      "Today and this morning and all past days and days to come, she said.",
      "I think you re giving way to pessimism.",
      "You must rouse yourself, you must look life in the face.",
      "I know it s hard, but....",
      "I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices, Anna began suddenly, but I hate him for his virtues.",
      "I can t live with him.",
      "the sight of him has a physical effect on me, it makes me beside myself.",
      "I can t, I can t live with him.",
      "I have been unhappy, and used to think one couldn t be more unhappy, but the awful state of things I am going through now, I could never have conceived.",
      "Would you believe it, that knowing he s a good man, a splendid man, that I m not worth his little finger, still I hate him.",
      "I hate him for his generosity.",
      "And there s nothing left for me but.... She would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her finish.",
      "You are ill and overwrought, he said; believe me, you re exaggerating dreadfully.",
      "There s nothing so terrible in it.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",
      "No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch s place, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile (the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound, but softened and soothed.",
      "His gentle, soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil.",
      "And Anna soon felt this.",
      "No, Stiva, she said, I m lost, lost!",
      "worse than lost!",
      "I can t say yet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it s not over.",
      "I m an overstrained string that must snap.",
      "But it s not ended yet ... and it will have a fearful end.",
      "No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.",
      "There s no position from which there is no way of escape.",
      "I have thought, and thought.",
      "Only one.... Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death, and he would not let her say it.",
      "Not at all, he said.",
      "Listen to me.",
      "You can t see your own position as I can.",
      "Let me tell you candidly my opinion.",
      "Again he smiled discreetly his almond-oil smile.",
      "I ll begin from the beginning.",
      "You married a man twenty years older than yourself.",
      "You married him without love and not knowing what love was.",
      "It was a mistake, let s admit.",
      "A fearful mistake!",
      "said Anna.",
      "But I repeat, it s an accomplished fact.",
      "Then you had, let us say, the misfortune to love a man not your husband.",
      "That was a misfortune; but that, too, is an accomplished fact.",
      "And your husband knew it and forgave it.",
      "He stopped at each sentence, waiting for her to object, but she made no answer.",
      "That s so.",
      "Now the question is: can you go on living with your husband?",
      "Do you wish it?",
      "Does he wish it?",
      "I know nothing, nothing.",
      "But you said yourself that you can t endure him.",
      "No, I didn t say so.",
      "I deny it.",
      "I can t tell, I don t know anything about it.",
      "Yes, but let.... You can t understand.",
      "I feel I m lying head downwards in a sort of pit, but I ought not to save myself.",
      "And I can t.... Never mind, we ll slip something under and pull you out.",
      "I understand you: I understand that you can t take it on yourself to express your wishes, your feelings.",
      "There s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over.",
      "But he sees this and knows it.",
      "And do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you?",
      "You re wretched, he s wretched, and what good can come of it?",
      "while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.",
      "With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea, and looked significantly at her.",
      "She said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent.",
      "But from the look in her face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he saw that if she did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness.",
      "I m awfully sorry for you!",
      "And how happy I should be if I could arrange things!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more boldly.",
      "Don t speak, don t say a word!",
      "God grant only that I may speak as I feel.",
      "I m going to him.",
      "Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing.",
      "Chapter 22 Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked into Alexey Alexandrovitch s room.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.",
      "I m not interrupting you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, on the sight of his brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him.",
      "To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way, and sniffing the leather, took a cigarette out of it.",
      "Do you want anything?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without eagerness.",
      "Yes, I wished ...",
      "I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity.",
      "This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him.",
      "I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you, he said, reddening.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his face struck Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.",
      "I intended ...",
      "I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position, he said, still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law, and without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished letter, and handed it to his brother-in-law.",
      "I think unceasingly of the same thing.",
      "And here is what I had begun writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence irritates her, he said, as he gave him the letter.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and began to read.",
      "I see that my presence is irksome to you.",
      "Painful as it is to me to believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise.",
      "I don t blame you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life.",
      "I do not regret, and shall never regret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing your good, the good of your soul and now I see I have not attained that.",
      "Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul.",
      "I put myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what s right.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing what to say.",
      "This silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch s lips began twitching nervously, while he still gazed without speaking at Karenin s face.",
      "That s what I wanted to say to her, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning away.",
      "Yes, yes.... said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer for the tears that were choking him.",
      "Yes, yes, I understand you, he brought out at last.",
      "I want to know what she would like, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I am afraid she does not understand her own position.",
      "She is not a judge, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recovering himself.",
      "She is crushed, simply crushed by your generosity.",
      "If she were to read this letter, she would be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang her head lower than ever.",
      "Yes, but what s to be done in that case?",
      "how explain, how find out her wishes?",
      "If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position.",
      "So you consider it must be ended?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him.",
      "he added, with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him.",
      "I see no possible way out of it.",
      "There is some way of getting out of every position, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful.",
      "There was a time when you thought of breaking off....",
      "If you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy.... Happiness may be variously understood.",
      "But suppose that I agree to everything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of our position?",
      "If you care to know my opinion, said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he had been talking to Anna.",
      "His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",
      "She will never speak out about it.",
      "But one thing is possible, one thing she might desire, he went on, that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them.",
      "To my thinking, in your position what s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another.",
      "And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides.",
      "Divorce, Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.",
      "Yes, I imagine that divorce yes, divorce, Stepan Arkadyevitch repeated, reddening.",
      "That is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in.",
      "What can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together?",
      "That may always happen.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.",
      "There s only one point to be considered: is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties?",
      "If not, it is very simple, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to himself, and made no answer.",
      "All that seemed so simple to Stepan Arkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times.",
      "And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly impossible.",
      "Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed to him now out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and beloved by him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame.",
      "Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds.",
      "What would become of his son in case of a divorce?",
      "To leave him with his mother was out of the question.",
      "The divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good.",
      "Keep him with him?",
      "He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want.",
      "But apart from this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey Alexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining Anna.",
      "The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow, that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk into his heart.",
      "And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her, with his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.",
      "To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children whom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin.",
      "If she were divorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky s, and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her husband was living.",
      "She will join him, and in a year or two he will throw her over, or she will form a new tie, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to blame for her ruin.",
      "He had thought it all over hundreds of times, and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible.",
      "He did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him; to every word he had a thousand objections to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit.",
      "The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.",
      "She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she leaves it all to your generosity.",
      "thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.",
      "You are distressed, I understand that.",
      "But if you think it over.... Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "he cried in a shrill voice.",
      "I will take the disgrace on myself, I will give up even my son, but ... but wouldn t it be better to let it alone?",
      "Still you may do as you like.... And turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat down on a chair at the window.",
      "There was bitterness, there was shame in his heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched.",
      "He was silent for a space.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity, he said.",
      "But it seems it was the will of God, he added, and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped him.",
      "This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such.",
      "I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both her and you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "When he went out of his brother-in-law s room he was touched, but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would not go back on his words.",
      "To this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends.",
      "He put this riddle into two or three different ways.",
      "But I ll work it out better than that, he said to himself with a smile.",
      "Chapter 23 Vronsky s wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the heart, and for several days he had lain between life and death.",
      "The first time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother s wife, was alone in the room.",
      "Varya, he said, looking sternly at her, I shot myself by accident.",
      "And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so.",
      "Or else it s too ridiculous.",
      "Without answering his words, Varya bent over him, and with a delighted smile gazed into his face.",
      "His eyes were clear, not feverish; but their expression was stern.",
      "You re not in pain?",
      "A little here.",
      "He pointed to his breast.",
      "Then let me change your bandages.",
      "In silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while she bandaged him up.",
      "When she had finished he said: I m not delirious.",
      "Please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose.",
      "No one does say so.",
      "Only I hope you won t shoot yourself by accident any more, she said, with a questioning smile.",
      "Of course I won t, but it would have been better.... And he smiled gloomily.",
      "In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when the inflammation was over and he began to recover, he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery.",
      "By his action he had, as it were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before.",
      "He could now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He recognized all his magnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it.",
      "Besides, he got back again into the beaten track of his life.",
      "He saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he could live in accordance with his own habits.",
      "One thing he could not pluck out of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was the regret, amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever.",
      "That now, having expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to renounce her, and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love, he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time, and that haunted him in all their charm.",
      "Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation.",
      "But the nearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty.",
      "His wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for Tashkend.",
      "To see her once and then to bury myself, to die, he thought, and as he was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought to Betsy.",
      "Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and brought him back a negative reply.",
      "So much the better, thought Vronsky, when he received the news.",
      "It was a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.",
      "Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced that she had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky could see Anna.",
      "Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting all his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her husband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins .",
      "He ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost breaking into a run, he went into her room.",
      "And without considering, without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung his arms round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck with kisses.",
      "Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she would say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything of it; his passion mastered her.",
      "She tried to calm him, to calm herself, but it was too late.",
      "His feeling infected her.",
      "Her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing.",
      "Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours, she said at last, pressing his hands to her bosom.",
      "So it had to be, he said.",
      "So long as we live, it must be so.",
      "I know it now.",
      "That s true, she said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing his head.",
      "Still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened.",
      "It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy.",
      "Our love, if it could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it, he said, lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile.",
      "And she could not but respond with a smile not to his words, but to the love in his eyes.",
      "She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it.",
      "I don t know you with this short hair.",
      "You ve grown so pretty.",
      "A boy.",
      "But how pale you are!",
      "Yes, I m very weak, she said, smiling.",
      "And her lips began trembling again.",
      "We ll go to Italy; you will get strong, he said.",
      "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your family with you?",
      "she said, looking close into his eyes.",
      "It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.",
      "Stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but I can t accept _his_ generosity, she said, looking dreamily past Vronsky s face.",
      "I don t want a divorce; it s all the same to me now.",
      "Only I don t know what he will decide about Seryozha.",
      "He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son, of divorce.",
      "What did it all matter?",
      "Don t speak of that, don t think of it, he said, turning her hand in his, and trying to draw her attention to him; but still she did not look at him.",
      "Oh, why didn t I die!",
      "it would have been better, she said, and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks; but she tried to smile, so as not to wound him.",
      "To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would have been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and impossible.",
      "But now, without an instant s consideration, he declined it, and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step, he immediately retired from the army.",
      "A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having obtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.",
      "PART FIVE Chapter 1 Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time.",
      "But she could not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting it off too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky s was seriously ill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer.",
      "And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts a larger and smaller trousseau the princess consented to have the wedding before Lent.",
      "She determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made later, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not.",
      "The arrangement was the more suitable as, immediately after the wedding, the young people were to go to the country, where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted.",
      "Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence, and that he need not now think or care about anything, that everything was being done and would be done for him by others.",
      "He had not even plans and aims for the future, he left its arrangement to others, knowing that everything would be delightful.",
      "His brother Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do.",
      "All he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him.",
      "His brother raised money for him, the princess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad.",
      "He agreed to everything.",
      "Do what you choose, if it amuses you.",
      "I m happy, and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do, he thought.",
      "When he told Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch s advice that they should go abroad, he was much surprised that she did not agree to this, and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future.",
      "She knew Levin had work he loved in the country.",
      "She did not, as he saw, understand this work, she did not even care to understand it.",
      "But that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance.",
      "And then she knew their home would be in the country, and she wanted to go, not abroad where she was not going to live, but to the place where their home would be.",
      "This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin.",
      "But since he did not care either way, he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though it were his duty, to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much.",
      "But I say, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country, where he had got everything ready for the young people s arrival, have you a certificate of having been at confession?",
      "But what of it?",
      "You can t be married without it.",
      "_A e, a e, a e!_ cried Levin.",
      "Why, I believe it s nine years since I ve taken the sacrament!",
      "I never thought of it.",
      "You re a pretty fellow!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing, and you call me a Nihilist!",
      "But this won t do, you know.",
      "You must take the sacrament.",
      "There are four days left now.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also, and Levin had to go to confession.",
      "To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies.",
      "At this moment, in his present softened state of feeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible.",
      "Now, in the heyday of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have to be a liar or a scoffer.",
      "He felt incapable of being either.",
      "But though he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating, Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.",
      "Besides, what is it to you two days?",
      "And he s an awfully nice clever old fellow.",
      "He ll pull the tooth out for you so gently, you won t notice it.",
      "Standing at the first litany, Levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.",
      "But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him.",
      "He attempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having no sort of meaning, like the custom of paying calls.",
      "But he felt that he could not do that either.",
      "Levin found himself, like the majority of his contemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to religion.",
      "Believe he could not, and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong.",
      "And consequently, not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice told him, was therefore false and wrong.",
      "During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried not to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church.",
      "He had stood through the litany, the evening service and the midnight service, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, and without having tea went at eight o clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession.",
      "There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier, two old women, and the church officials.",
      "A young deacon, whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation.",
      "During the reading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words, Lord, have mercy on us!",
      "which resounded with an echo, Levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs, neither listening nor examining what was said.",
      "It s wonderful what expression there is in her hand, he thought, remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table.",
      "They had nothing to talk about, as was almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as she watched her action.",
      "He remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm.",
      "Have mercy on us again!",
      "thought Levin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple spring of the deacon s back bowing before him.",
      "She took my hand then and examined the lines.",
      "You ve got a splendid hand, she said.",
      "And he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon.",
      "Yes, now it will soon be over, he thought.",
      "No, it seems to be beginning again, he thought, listening to the prayers.",
      "No, it s just ending: there he is bowing down to the ground.",
      "That s always at the end.",
      "The deacon s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note unobtrusively, and the deacon said he would put it down in the register, and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church, he went to the altar.",
      "A moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to Levin.",
      "Thought, till then locked up, began to stir in Levin s head, but he made haste to drive it away.",
      "It will come right somehow, he thought, and went towards the altar-rails.",
      "He went up the steps, and turning to the right saw the priest.",
      "The priest, a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary, good-natured eyes, was standing at the altar-rails, turning over the pages of a missal.",
      "With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice.",
      "When he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned, facing Levin.",
      "Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession, he said, pointing to the crucifix.",
      "Do you believe in all the doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church?",
      "the priest went on, turning his eyes away from Levin s face and folding his hands under his stole.",
      "I have doubted, I doubt everything, said Levin in a voice that jarred on himself, and he ceased speaking.",
      "The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, and closing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent: Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God in His mercy will strengthen us.",
      "What are your special sins?",
      "he added, without the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time.",
      "My chief sin is doubt.",
      "I have doubts of everything, and for the most part I am in doubt.",
      "Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, the priest repeated the same words.",
      "What do you doubt about principally?",
      "I doubt of everything.",
      "I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of God, Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying.",
      "But Levin s words did not, it seemed, make much impression on the priest.",
      "What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?",
      "he said hurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.",
      "Levin did not speak.",
      "What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?",
      "the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon.",
      "Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights?",
      "Who has clothed the earth in its beauty?",
      "How explain it without the Creator?",
      "he said, looking inquiringly at Levin.",
      "Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question.",
      "I don t know, he said.",
      "You don t know!",
      "Then how can you doubt that God created all?",
      "the priest said, with good-humored perplexity.",
      "I don t understand it at all, said Levin, blushing, and feeling that his words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position.",
      "Pray to God and beseech Him.",
      "Even the holy fathers had doubts, and prayed to God to strengthen their faith.",
      "The devil has great power, and we must resist him.",
      "Pray to God, beseech Him.",
      "Pray to God, he repeated hurriedly.",
      "The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.",
      "You re about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?",
      "he resumed, with a smile.",
      "An excellent young lady.",
      "Yes, answered Levin, blushing for the priest.",
      "What does he want to ask me about this at confession for?",
      "And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him: You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with offspring.",
      "Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to infidelity?",
      "he said, with gentle reproachfulness.",
      "If you love your child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth.",
      "What answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you: Papa!",
      "who made all that enchants me in this world the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the grass?",
      "Can you say to him: I don t know ?",
      "You cannot but know, since the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us.",
      "Or your child will ask you: What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?",
      "What will you say to him when you know nothing?",
      "How will you answer him?",
      "Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil?",
      "That s not right, he said, and he stopped, putting his head on one side and looking at Levin with his kindly, gentle eyes.",
      "Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever asked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those questions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.",
      "You are entering upon a time of life, pursued the priest, when you must choose your path and keep to it.",
      "Pray to God that He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you!",
      "he concluded.",
      "Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His loving-kindness, forgives this child.... and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the priest blessed him and dismissed him.",
      "On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie.",
      "Apart from this, there remained a vague memory that what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it that must be cleared up.",
      "Of course, not now, thought Levin, but some day later on.",
      "Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for which he blamed his friend Sviazhsky.",
      "Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly s, and was in very high spirits.",
      "To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea, and done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight.",
      "Chapter 2 On the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom (the princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs), Levin did not see his betrothed, and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends, casually brought together at his rooms.",
      "These were Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor of natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him, and Tchirikov, his best man, a Moscow conciliation-board judge, Levin s companion in his bear-hunts.",
      "The dinner was a very merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest mood, and was much amused by Katavasov s originality.",
      "Katavasov, feeling his originality was appreciated and understood, made the most of it.",
      "Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to conversation of any sort.",
      "See, now, said Katavasov, drawling his words from a habit acquired in the lecture-room, what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "I m not speaking of present company, for he s absent.",
      "At the time he left the university he was fond of science, took an interest in humanity; now one-half of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself, and the other to justifying the deceit.",
      "A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Oh, no, I m not an enemy of matrimony.",
      "I m in favor of division of labor.",
      "People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment.",
      "That s how I look at it.",
      "To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I m not one of their number.",
      "How happy I shall be when I hear that you re in love!",
      "Please invite me to the wedding.",
      "I m in love now.",
      "Yes, with a cuttlefish!",
      "You know, Levin turned to his brother, Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the.... Now, make a muddle of it!",
      "It doesn t matter what about.",
      "And the fact is, I certainly do love cuttlefish.",
      "But that s no hindrance to your loving your wife.",
      "The cuttlefish is no hindrance.",
      "The wife is the hindrance.",
      "Oh, you ll see!",
      "You care about farming, hunting, well, you d better look out!",
      "Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno, and two bears, said Tchirikov.",
      "Well, you must go and get them without me.",
      "Ah, that s the truth, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "And you may say good-bye to bear-hunting for the future your wife won t allow it!",
      "The picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever.",
      "Still, it s a pity they should get those two bears without you.",
      "Do you remember last time at Hapilovo?",
      "That was a delightful hunt!",
      "said Tchirikov.",
      "Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her, and so said nothing.",
      "There s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor life, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "However happy you may be, you must regret your freedom.",
      "And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window, like Gogol s bridegroom?",
      "Of course there is, but it isn t confessed, said Katavasov, and he broke into loud laughter.",
      "Oh, well, the window s open.",
      "Let s start off this instant to Tver!",
      "There s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair.",
      "Seriously, let s go by the five o clock!",
      "And here let them do what they like, said Tchirikov, smiling.",
      "Well, now, on my honor, said Levin, smiling, I can t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom.",
      "Yes, there s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can t find anything there, said Katavasov.",
      "Wait a bit, when you set it to rights a little, you ll find it!",
      "No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling (he could not say love before them) and happiness, a certain regret at losing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at the very loss of my freedom.",
      "It s a hopeless case!",
      "said Katavasov.",
      "Well, let s drink to his recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth!",
      "Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding.",
      "When he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends, Levin asked himself: had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken?",
      "He smiled at the question.",
      "Freedom!",
      "What is freedom for?",
      "Happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes, thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at all that s happiness!",
      "But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?",
      "some voice suddenly whispered to him.",
      "The smile died away from his face, and he grew thoughtful.",
      "And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him.",
      "There came over him a dread and doubt doubt of everything.",
      "What if she does not love me?",
      "What if she s marrying me simply to be married?",
      "What if she doesn t see herself what she s doing?",
      "he asked himself.",
      "She may come to her senses, and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me.",
      "And strange, most evil thoughts of her began to come to him.",
      "He was jealous of Vronsky, as he had been a year ago, as though the evening he had seen her with Vronsky had been yesterday.",
      "He suspected she had not told him everything.",
      "He jumped up quickly.",
      "No, this can t go on!",
      "he said to himself in despair.",
      "I ll go to her; I ll ask her; I ll say for the last time: we are free, and hadn t we better stay so?",
      "Anything s better than endless misery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!",
      "With despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men, against himself, against her, he went out of the hotel and drove to her house.",
      "He found her in one of the back rooms.",
      "She was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.",
      "she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight.",
      "Kostya!",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "(These latter days she used these names almost alternately.)",
      "I didn t expect you!",
      "I m going through my wardrobe to see what s for whom.... Oh!",
      "that s very nice!",
      "he said gloomily, looking at the maid.",
      "You can go, Dunyasha, I ll call you presently, said Kitty.",
      "Kostya, what s the matter?",
      "she asked, definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out.",
      "She noticed his strange face, agitated and gloomy, and a panic came over her.",
      "Kitty!",
      "I m in torture.",
      "I can t suffer alone, he said with despair in his voice, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes.",
      "He saw already from her loving, truthful face, that nothing could come of what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself.",
      "I ve come to say that there s still time.",
      "This can all be stopped and set right.",
      "What I have said a thousand times over, and can t help thinking ... that I m not worthy of you.",
      "You couldn t consent to marry me.",
      "Think a little.",
      "You ve made a mistake.",
      "Think it over thoroughly.",
      "You can t love me....",
      "If ... better say so, he said, not looking at her.",
      "I shall be wretched.",
      "Let people say what they like; anything s better than misery.... Far better now while there s still time....",
      "I don t understand, she answered, panic-stricken; you mean you want to give it up ... don t want it?",
      "Yes, if you don t love me.",
      "You re out of your mind!",
      "she cried, turning crimson with vexation.",
      "But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and flinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him.",
      "What are you thinking?",
      "tell me all.",
      "I am thinking you can t love me.",
      "What can you love me for?",
      "what can I do?...",
      "she said, and burst into tears.",
      "he cried, and kneeling before her, he fell to kissing her hands.",
      "When the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them completely reconciled.",
      "Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him, but had gone so far in answer to his question, what she loved him for as to explain what for.",
      "She told him that she loved him because she understood him completely, because she knew what he would like, and because everything he liked was good.",
      "And this seemed to him perfectly clear.",
      "When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty s wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed to her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given away, but Dunyasha must have the blue one.",
      "How is it you don t see?",
      "She s a brunette, and it won t suit her....",
      "I ve worked it all out.",
      "Hearing why he had come, the princess was half humorously, half seriously angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder Kitty s hair-dressing, as Charles the hair-dresser was just coming.",
      "As it is, she s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks, and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense, she said to him.",
      "Get along with you, my dear!",
      "Levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotel.",
      "His brother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, all in full dress, were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture.",
      "There was no time to lose.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride.",
      "Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man, and another that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent back....",
      "Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged.",
      "One thing was unmistakable, that there must be no delay, as it was already half-past six.",
      "Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the ground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him three times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a hurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages.",
      "Come, I ll tell you how we ll manage: you drive in our carriage to fetch him, and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he ll be so good, will drive there and then send his carriage.",
      "Of course; I shall be delighted.",
      "We ll come on directly with him.",
      "Are your things sent off?",
      "Yes, answered Levin, and he told Kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress.",
      "Chapter 3 A crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding.",
      "Those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows, pushing, wrangling, and peeping through the gratings.",
      "More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police.",
      "A police officer, regardless of the frost, stood at the entrance, gorgeous in his uniform.",
      "More carriages were continually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church.",
      "Inside the church both lusters were already lighted, and all the candles before the holy pictures.",
      "The gilt on the red ground of the holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures, and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the floor, and the rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps of the altar, and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and surplices all were flooded with light.",
      "On the right side of the warm church, in the crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and broadcloth, velvet, satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms and long gloves, there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola.",
      "Every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away, and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in.",
      "But the door had opened more than ten times, and each time it was either a belated guest or guests, who joined the circle of the invited on the right, or a spectator, who had eluded or softened the police officer, and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left.",
      "Both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation.",
      "At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately, and attached no importance at all to their being late.",
      "Then they began to look more and more often towards the door, and to talk of whether anything could have happened.",
      "Then the long delay began to be positively discomforting, and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation.",
      "The head deacon, as though to remind them of the value of his time, coughed impatiently, making the window-panes quiver in their frames.",
      "In the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses.",
      "The priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come, more and more often he went himself, in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom.",
      "At last one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said, It really is strange, though!",
      "and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction.",
      "One of the bridegroom s best men went to find out what had happened.",
      "Kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the Shtcherbatskys house with her sister, Madame Lvova, who was her bridal-mother.",
      "She was looking out of the window, and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her bridegroom was at the church.",
      "Levin meanwhile, in his trousers, but without his coat and waistcoat, was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel, continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor.",
      "But in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair, and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was smoking serenely.",
      "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool s position?",
      "Yes, it is stupid, Stepan Arkadyevitch assented, smiling soothingly.",
      "But don t worry, it ll be brought directly.",
      "No, what is to be done!",
      "said Levin, with smothered fury.",
      "And these fools of open waistcoats!",
      "Out of the question!",
      "he said, looking at the crumpled front of his shirt.",
      "And what if the things have been taken on to the railway station!",
      "he roared in desperation.",
      "Then you must put on mine.",
      "I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.",
      "It s not nice to look ridiculous....",
      "it will _come round_.",
      "The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit, Kouzma, his old servant, had brought him the coat, waistcoat, and everything that was wanted.",
      "But the shirt!",
      "You ve got a shirt on, Kouzma answered, with a placid smile.",
      "Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt, and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the Shtcherbatskys house, from which the young people were to set out the same evening, he had done so, packing everything but the dress suit.",
      "The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat.",
      "It was a long way to send to the Shtcherbatskys .",
      "They sent out to buy a shirt.",
      "The servant came back; everything was shut up it was Sunday.",
      "They sent to Stepan Arkadyevitch s and brought a shirt it was impossibly wide and short.",
      "They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys to unpack the things.",
      "The bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage, peeping out into the corridor, and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to Kitty and what she might be thinking now.",
      "At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.",
      "Only just in time.",
      "They were just lifting it into the van, said Kouzma.",
      "Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.",
      "You won t help matters like this, said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile, hurrying with more deliberation after him.",
      "It will come round, it will come round ...",
      "I tell you.",
      "Chapter 4 They ve come!",
      "Which one?",
      "Rather young, eh?",
      "Why, my dear soul, she looks more dead than alive!",
      "were the comments in the crowd, when Levin, meeting his bride in the entrance, walked with her into the church.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay, and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another.",
      "Levin saw nothing and no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.",
      "Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late, and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think so.",
      "He looked at her hair done up high, with the long white veil and white flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front, her strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever not because these flowers, this veil, this gown from Paris added anything to her beauty; but because, in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire, the expression of her sweet face, of her eyes, of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness.",
      "I was beginning to think you meant to run away, she said, and smiled to him.",
      "It s so stupid, what happened to me, I m ashamed to speak of it!",
      "he said, reddening, and he was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch, who came up to him.",
      "This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head and smiling.",
      "answered Levin, without an idea of what they were talking about.",
      "Now, Kostya, you have to decide, said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay, a weighty question.",
      "You are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity.",
      "They ask me, are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted?",
      "It s a matter of ten roubles, he added, relaxing his lips into a smile.",
      "I have decided, but I was afraid you might not agree.",
      "Levin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile.",
      "Well, how s it to be then?",
      "unlighted or lighted candles?",
      "that s the question.",
      "Yes, yes, unlighted.",
      "Oh, I m very glad.",
      "The question s decided!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "How silly men are, though, in this position, he said to Tchirikov, when Levin, after looking absently at him, had moved back to his bride.",
      "Kitty, mind you re the first to step on the carpet, said Countess Nordston, coming up.",
      "You re a nice person!",
      "she said to Levin.",
      "Aren t you frightened, eh?",
      "said Marya Dmitrievna, an old aunt.",
      "Are you cold?",
      "You re pale.",
      "Stop a minute, stoop down, said Kitty s sister, Madame Lvova, and with her plump, handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head.",
      "Dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and then laughed unnaturally.",
      "Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.",
      "Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart of the church.",
      "The priest turned to Levin saying something.",
      "Levin did not hear what the priest said.",
      "Take the bride s hand and lead her up, the best man said to Levin.",
      "It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of him.",
      "For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm till he understood at last that what he had to do was, without changing his position, to take her right hand in his right hand.",
      "When at last he had taken the bride s hand in the correct way, the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern.",
      "The crowd of friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts.",
      "Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride s train.",
      "The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles.",
      "The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap, with his long silvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his ears, was fumbling with something at the lectern, putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously, whispered something, and making a sign to Levin, walked back again.",
      "The priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, facing the bridal pair.",
      "The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin.",
      "He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom, sighed, and putting his right hand out from his vestment, blessed the bridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty.",
      "Then he gave them the candles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.",
      "thought Levin, and he looked round at his bride.",
      "Looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her.",
      "She did not look round, but the high scalloped collar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly.",
      "He saw that a sigh was held back in her throat, and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle.",
      "All the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends and relations, their annoyance, his ludicrous position all suddenly passed away and he was filled with joy and dread.",
      "The handsome, stately head-deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head, stepped smartly forward, and lifting his stole on two fingers, stood opposite the priest.",
      "Blessed be the name of the Lord, the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another, setting the air quivering with waves of sound.",
      "Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, the little old priest answered in a submissive, piping voice, still fingering something at the lectern.",
      "And the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, from the windows to the vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody.",
      "It grew stronger, rested for an instant, and slowly died away.",
      "They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for salvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for the servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their troth.",
      "Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we beseech Thee, the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon.",
      "Levin heard the words, and they impressed him.",
      "How did they guess that it is help, just help that one wants?",
      "he thought, recalling all his fears and doubts of late.",
      "what can I do in this fearful business, he thought, without help?",
      "Yes, it is help I want now.",
      "When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family, the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book: Eternal God, that joinest together in love them that were separate, he read in a gentle, piping voice: who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their descendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants, Konstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.",
      "For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.",
      "Amen!",
      "the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.",
      "Joinest together in love them that were separate.",
      "What deep meaning in those words, and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment, thought Levin.",
      "Is she feeling the same as I?",
      "And looking round, he met her eyes, and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was.",
      "But this was a mistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service; she had not heard them, in fact.",
      "She could not listen to them and take them in, so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger.",
      "That feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul, and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her.",
      "On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street she had gone up to him in her brown dress, and given herself to him without a word on that day, at that hour, there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life, and a quite different, new, utterly strange life had begun for her, while the old life was actually going on as before.",
      "Those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery.",
      "All her life, all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man, still uncomprehended by her, to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion, even less comprehended than the man himself, and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life.",
      "Living the old life, she was horrified at herself, at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past, to things, to habits, to the people she had loved, who loved her to her mother, who was wounded by her indifference, to her kind, tender father, till then dearer than all the world.",
      "At one moment she was horrified at this indifference, at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference.",
      "She could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life with this man; but this new life was not yet, and she could not even picture it clearly to herself.",
      "There was only anticipation, the dread and joy of the new and the unknown.",
      "And now behold anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life all was ending, and the new was beginning.",
      "This new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience; but, terrible or not, the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul, and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart.",
      "Turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took Kitty s little ring, and asking Levin for his hand, put it on the first joint of his finger.",
      "The servant of God, Konstantin, plights his troth to the servant of God, Ekaterina.",
      "And putting his big ring on Kitty s touchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.",
      "And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper.",
      "At last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed the rings with the cross, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and Levin the little one.",
      "Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings from hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.",
      "Dolly, Tchirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right.",
      "There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with which Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips.",
      "He had a feeling that any smile would jar on them.",
      "Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female, the priest read after the exchange of rings, from Thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation of children.",
      "O Lord, our God, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our fathers, from generation to generation, bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their troth fast in faith, and union of hearts, and truth, and love.... Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage, all his dreams of how he would order his life, were mere childishness, and that it was something he had not understood hitherto, and now understood less than ever, though it was being performed upon him.",
      "The lump in his throat rose higher and higher, tears that would not be checked came into his eyes.",
      "Chapter 5 In the church there was all Moscow, all the friends and relations; and during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted church, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties, frockcoats, and uniforms.",
      "The talk was principally kept up by the men, while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony, which always means so much to them.",
      "In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters: Dolly, and the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame Lvova, who had just arrived from abroad.",
      "Why is it Marie s in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?",
      "said Madame Korsunskaya.",
      "With her complexion, it s the one salvation, responded Madame Trubetskaya.",
      "I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening?",
      "It s like shop-people....",
      "So much prettier.",
      "I was married in the evening too.... answered Madame Korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming she had been that day, and how absurdly in love her husband was, and how different it all was now.",
      "They say if anyone s best man more than ten times, he ll never be married.",
      "I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken, said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya, who had designs on him.",
      "Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile.",
      "She looked at Kitty, thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty s place, and how she would remind him then of his joke today.",
      "Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that he meant to put the crown on Kitty s chignon for luck.",
      "She ought not to have worn a chignon, answered Madame Nikolaeva, who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her, the wedding should be of the simplest.",
      "I don t like such grandeur.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna, jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves.",
      "Your brother may feel proud of himself.",
      "She s a marvel of sweetness.",
      "I believe you re envious.",
      "Oh, I ve got over that, Darya Dmitrievna, he answered, and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister-in-law his joke about divorce.",
      "The wreath wants setting straight, she answered, not hearing him.",
      "What a pity she s lost her looks so, Countess Nordston said to Madame Lvova.",
      "Still he s not worth her little finger, is he?",
      "Oh, I like him so not because he s my future _beau-fr re_, answered Madame Lvova.",
      "And how well he s behaving!",
      "It s so difficult, too, to look well in such a position, not to be ridiculous.",
      "And he s not ridiculous, and not affected; one can see he s moved.",
      "You expected it, I suppose?",
      "She always cared for him.",
      "Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first.",
      "I warned Kitty.",
      "It will make no difference, said Madame Lvova; we re all obedient wives; it s in our family.",
      "Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose.",
      "And you, Dolly?",
      "Dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer.",
      "She was deeply moved.",
      "The tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have spoken without crying.",
      "She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin; going back in thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her own innocent love.",
      "She recalled not herself only, but all her women-friends and acquaintances.",
      "She thought of them on the one day of their triumph, when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown, with love and hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and stepping forward into the mysterious future.",
      "Among the brides that came back to her memory, she thought too of her darling Anna, of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing.",
      "And she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil.",
      "And now?",
      "It s terribly strange, she said to herself.",
      "It was not merely the sisters, the women-friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony.",
      "Women who were quite strangers, mere spectators, were watching it excitedly, holding their breath, in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom, and angrily not answering, often not hearing, the remarks of the callous men, who kept making joking or irrelevant observations.",
      "Why has she been crying?",
      "Is she being married against her will?",
      "Against her will to a fine fellow like that?",
      "A prince, isn t he?",
      "Is that her sister in the white satin?",
      "Just listen how the deacon booms out, And fearing her husband.",
      "Are the choristers from Tchudovo?",
      "No, from the Synod.",
      "I asked the footman.",
      "He says he s going to take her home to his country place at once.",
      "Awfully rich, they say.",
      "That s why she s being married to him.",
      "No, they re a well-matched pair.",
      "I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away crinolines were not being worn.",
      "Just look at her in the puce dress an ambassador s wife they say she is how her skirt bounces out from side to side!",
      "What a pretty dear the bride is like a lamb decked with flowers!",
      "Well, say what you will, we women feel for our sister.",
      "Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors.",
      "Chapter 6 When the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff, the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug.",
      "Though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable of recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it.",
      "They did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he had stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.",
      "After the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon matrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their answers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.",
      "Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their meaning, but she could not.",
      "The feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on, and deprived her of all power of attention.",
      "They prayed: Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters.",
      "They alluded to God s creation of a wife from Adam s rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh, and that this is a great mystery ; they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless them, like Isaac and Rebecca, Joseph, Moses and Zipporah, and that they might look upon their children s children.",
      "That s all splendid, thought Kitty, catching the words, all that s just as it should be, and a smile of happiness, unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her, beamed on her radiant face.",
      "Put it on quite, voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky, his hand shaking in its three-button glove, held the crown high above her head.",
      "Put it on!",
      "she whispered, smiling.",
      "Levin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face, and unconsciously her feeling infected him.",
      "He too, like her felt glad and happy.",
      "They enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head deacon s voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the outside public.",
      "They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting Glory to God.",
      "Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were at one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt.",
      "The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church.",
      "It seemed to Levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did.",
      "Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people.",
      "Levin looked at Kitty, and he had never before seen her look as she did.",
      "She was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face.",
      "Levin longed to say something to her, but he did not know whether it was all over.",
      "The priest got him out of his difficulty.",
      "He smiled his kindly smile and said gently, Kiss your wife, and you kiss your husband, and took the candles out of their hands.",
      "Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care, gave her his arm, and with a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of the church.",
      "He did not believe, he could not believe, that it was true.",
      "It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it, because he felt that they were one.",
      "After supper, the same night, the young people left for the country.",
      "Chapter 7 Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in Europe.",
      "They had visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and had just arrived at a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time.",
      "A handsome head waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an evening coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach, stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets, looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him.",
      "Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase, the head waiter turned round, and seeing the Russian count, who had taken their best rooms, he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially, and with a bow informed him that a courier had been, and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged.",
      "The steward was prepared to sign the agreement.",
      "I m glad to hear it, said Vronsky.",
      "Is madame at home or not?",
      "Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now, answered the waiter.",
      "Vronsky took off his soft, wide-brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair, which had grown half over his ears, and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head.",
      "And glancing casually at the gentleman, who still stood there gazing intently at him, he would have gone on.",
      "This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you, said the head waiter.",
      "With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere, and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life, Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman, who had retreated and stood still again, and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both.",
      "Golenishtchev!",
      "It really was Golenishtchev, a comrade of Vronsky s in the Corps of Pages.",
      "In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he left the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office under the government.",
      "Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps, and had only met once since.",
      "At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty, intellectually liberal line, and was consequently disposed to look down upon Vronsky s interests and calling in life.",
      "Hence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume, the meaning of which was: You may like or dislike my way of life, that s a matter of the most perfect indifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me.",
      "Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by Vronsky.",
      "This second meeting might have been expected, one would have supposed, to estrange them still more.",
      "But now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another.",
      "Vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was.",
      "He forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade.",
      "The same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev s face.",
      "How glad I am to meet you!",
      "said Vronsky, showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile.",
      "I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn t know which one.",
      "I m very, very glad!",
      "Let s go in.",
      "Come, tell me what you re doing.",
      "I ve been living here for two years.",
      "I m working.",
      "said Vronsky, with sympathy; let s go in.",
      "And with the habit common with Russians, instead of saying in Russian what he wanted to keep from the servants, he began to speak in French.",
      "Do you know Madame Karenina?",
      "We are traveling together.",
      "I am going to see her now, he said in French, carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev s face.",
      "I did not know (though he did know), Golenishtchev answered carelessly.",
      "Four days, Vronsky answered, once more scrutinizing his friend s face intently.",
      "Yes, he s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly, Vronsky said to himself, catching the significance of Golenishtchev s face and the change of subject.",
      "I can introduce him to Anna, he looks at it properly.",
      "During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna, he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with Anna, and for the most part, in men, he had met with the proper way of looking at it.",
      "But if he had been asked, and those who looked at it properly had been asked, exactly how they did look at it, both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer.",
      "In reality, those who in Vronsky s opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all, but behaved in general as well-bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions.",
      "They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and even approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words.",
      "Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and therefore was doubly pleased to see him.",
      "And in fact, Golenishtchev s manner to Madame Karenina, when he was taken to call on her, was all that Vronsky could have desired.",
      "Obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.",
      "He had never met Anna before, and was struck by her beauty, and still more by the frankness with which she accepted her position.",
      "She blushed when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face.",
      "But what he liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she called Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house they had just taken, what was here called a palazzo.",
      "Golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position.",
      "Looking at Anna s manner of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey Alexandrovitch and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly.",
      "He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand: how it was that, having made her husband wretched, having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she yet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness.",
      "It s in the guide-book, said Golenishtchev, referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken.",
      "There s a first-rate Tintoretto there.",
      "One of his latest period.",
      "I tell you what: it s a lovely day, let s go and have another look at it, said Vronsky, addressing Anna.",
      "I shall be very glad to; I ll go and put on my hat.",
      "Would you say it s hot?",
      "she said, stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at Vronsky.",
      "And again a vivid flush overspread her face.",
      "Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish.",
      "He looked a long, tender look at her.",
      "No, not very, he said.",
      "And it seemed to her that she understood everything, most of all, that he was pleased with her; and smiling to him, she walked with her rapid step out at the door.",
      "The friends glanced at one another, and a look of hesitation came into both faces, as though Golenishtchev, unmistakably admiring her, would have liked to say something about her, and could not find the right thing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so.",
      "Well then, Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort; so you re settled here?",
      "You re still at the same work, then?",
      "he went on, recalling that he had been told Golenishtchev was writing something.",
      "Yes, I m writing the second part of the _Two Elements_, said Golenishtchev, coloring with pleasure at the question that is, to be exact, I am not writing it yet; I am preparing, collecting materials.",
      "It will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.",
      "We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium, and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views.",
      "Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the _Two Elements_, of which the author spoke as something well known.",
      "But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the _Two Elements_, he listened to him with some interest, for Golenishtchev spoke well.",
      "But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him.",
      "As he went on talking, his eyes glittered more and more angrily; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents, and his face grew more and more excited and worried.",
      "Remembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively, good-natured and well-bred boy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability, and he did not like it.",
      "What he particularly disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man belonging to a good set, should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows, with whom he was irritated and angry.",
      "Was it worth it?",
      "Vronsky disliked it, yet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and was sorry for him.",
      "Unhappiness, almost mental derangement, was visible on his mobile, rather handsome face, while without even noticing Anna s coming in, he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views.",
      "When Anna came in in her hat and cape, and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol, and stood beside him, it was with a feeling of relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him, and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion, full of life and happiness.",
      "Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was dejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner.",
      "After trying various subjects of conversation, she got him upon painting, of which he talked very well, and she listened to him attentively.",
      "They walked to the house they had taken, and looked over it.",
      "I am very glad of one thing, said Anna to Golenishtchev when they were on their way back, Alexey will have a capital _atelier_.",
      "You must certainly take that room, she said to Vronsky in Russian, using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation, and that there was no need of reserve before him.",
      "Do you paint?",
      "said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to Vronsky.",
      "Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a little, said Vronsky, reddening.",
      "He has great talent, said Anna with a delighted smile.",
      "I m no judge, of course.",
      "But good judges have said the same.",
      "Chapter 8 Anna, in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life.",
      "The thought of her husband s unhappiness did not poison her happiness.",
      "On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of.",
      "On the other side her husband s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted.",
      "The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her reconciliation with her husband, its breakdown, the news of Vronsky s wound, his visit, the preparations for divorce, the departure from her husband s house, the parting from her son all that seemed to her like a delirious dream, from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad.",
      "The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him.",
      "That man did drown.",
      "It was an evil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better not to brood over these fearful facts.",
      "One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled all the past, she remembered that one reflection.",
      "I have inevitably made that man wretched, she thought; but I don t want to profit by his misery.",
      "I too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above everything I am losing my good name and my son.",
      "I have done wrong, and so I don t want happiness, I don t want a divorce, and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child.",
      "But, however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer, she was not suffering.",
      "Shame there was not.",
      "With the tact of which both had such a large share, they had succeeded in avoiding Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves in a false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than they did themselves.",
      "Separation from the son she loved even that did not cause her anguish in these early days.",
      "The baby girl _his_ child was so sweet, and had so won Anna s heart, since she was all that was left her, that Anna rarely thought of her son.",
      "The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so intense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, that Anna felt unpardonably happy.",
      "The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she loved him.",
      "She loved him for himself, and for his love for her.",
      "Her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her.",
      "His presence was always sweet to her.",
      "All the traits of his character, which she learned to know better and better, were unutterably dear to her.",
      "His appearance, changed by his civilian dress, was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love.",
      "In everything he said, thought, and did, she saw something particularly noble and elevated.",
      "Her adoration of him alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find in him anything not fine.",
      "She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him.",
      "It seemed to her that, knowing this, he might sooner cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love, though she had no grounds for fearing it.",
      "But she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and showing that she appreciated it.",
      "He, who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career, in which he would have been certain to play a leading part he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake, and never betrayed the slightest regret.",
      "He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever, and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant.",
      "He, so manly a man, never opposed her, had indeed, with her, no will of his own, and was anxious, it seemed, for nothing but to anticipate her wishes.",
      "And she could not but appreciate this, even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her, the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her, sometimes weighed upon her.",
      "Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired, was not perfectly happy.",
      "He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected.",
      "It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires.",
      "For a time after joining his life to hers, and putting on civilian dress, he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love, and he was content, but not for long.",
      "He was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires _ennui_.",
      "Without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking it for a desire and an object.",
      "Sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete freedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in Petersburg.",
      "As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they could not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the cause a late supper with bachelor friends.",
      "Relations with the society of the place foreign and Russian were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position.",
      "The inspection of objects of interest, apart from the fact that everything had been seen already, had not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.",
      "And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get, hoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures.",
      "As he had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what to spend his money on, he had begun collecting engravings, he came to a stop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.",
      "He had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for imitating art, he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting he set to work to paint.",
      "He appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired by anyone of them; but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school.",
      "Since he knew nothing of this, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly from life embodied in art, his inspiration came very quickly and easily, and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate.",
      "More than any other style he liked the French graceful and effective and in that style he began to paint Anna s portrait in Italian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to everyone who saw it, extremely successful.",
      "Chapter 9 The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with pictures this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who had renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved.",
      "The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful, and having, through Golenishtchev, made acquaintance with a few interesting people, for a time he was satisfied.",
      "He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an Italian professor of painting, and studied medi val Italian life.",
      "Medi val Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the medi val style, which, indeed, was extremely becoming to him.",
      "Here we live, and know nothing of what s going on, Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning.",
      "Have you seen Mihailov s picture?",
      "he said, handing him a Russian gazette he had received that morning, and pointing to an article on a Russian artist, living in the very same town, and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about, and had been bought beforehand.",
      "The article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support.",
      "I ve seen it, answered Golenishtchev.",
      "Of course, he s not without talent, but it s all in a wrong direction.",
      "It s all the Ivanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting.",
      "What is the subject of the picture?",
      "asked Anna.",
      "Christ before Pilate.",
      "Christ is represented as a Jew with all the realism of the new school.",
      "And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories, Golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it.",
      "I can t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake.",
      "Christ always has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters.",
      "And therefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a revolutionist or a sage, let them take from history a Socrates, a Franklin, a Charlotte Corday, but not Christ.",
      "They take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art, and then.... And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?",
      "asked Vronsky, thinking that, as a Russian M cenas, it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.",
      "I should say not.",
      "He s a remarkable portrait-painter.",
      "Have you ever seen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova?",
      "But I believe he doesn t care about painting any more portraits, and so very likely he is in want.",
      "I maintain that.... Couldn t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "said Vronsky.",
      "Why mine?",
      "After yours I don t want another portrait.",
      "Better have one of Annie (so she called her baby girl).",
      "Here she is, she added, looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse, who was carrying the child out into the garden, and immediately glancing unnoticed at Vronsky.",
      "The handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture, was the one hidden grief in Anna s life.",
      "He painted with her as his model, admired her beauty and medi valism, and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son.",
      "Vronsky, too, glanced out of the window and into Anna s eyes, and, turning at once to Golenishtchev, he said: Do you know this Mihailov?",
      "I have met him.",
      "But he s a queer fish, and quite without breeding.",
      "You know, one of those uncouth new people one s so often coming across nowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are reared _d embl e_ in theories of atheism, scepticism, and materialism.",
      "In former days, said Golenishtchev, not observing, or not willing to observe, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak, in former days the free-thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle came to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born free-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.",
      "Well, he s of that class.",
      "He s the son, it appears, of some Moscow butler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up.",
      "When he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried, as he s no fool, to educate himself.",
      "And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture the magazines.",
      "In old times, you see, a man who wanted to educate himself a Frenchman, for instance would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historians and philosophers, and, you know, all the intellectual work that came in his way.",
      "But in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation, very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation, and he s ready.",
      "And that s not all twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with the creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else evolution, natural selection, struggle for existence and that s all.",
      "In my article I ve....",
      "I tell you what, said Anna, who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist, but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him, and ordering a portrait of him; I tell you what, she said, resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev, who was still talking away, let s go and see him!",
      "Golenishtchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed.",
      "But as the artist lived in a remote suburb, it was decided to take the carriage.",
      "An hour later Anna, with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the front seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb.",
      "On learning from the porter s wife, who came out to them, that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio, but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off, they sent her to him with their cards, asking permission to see his picture.",
      "Chapter 10 The artist Mihailov was, as always, at work when the cards of Count Vronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him.",
      "In the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture.",
      "On getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady, who had been asking for money.",
      "I ve said it to you twenty times, don t enter into details.",
      "You re fool enough at all times, and when you start explaining things in Italian you re a fool three times as foolish, he said after a long dispute.",
      "Don t let it run so long; it s not my fault.",
      "If I had the money.... Leave me in peace, for God s sake!",
      "Mihailov shrieked, with tears in his voice, and, stopping his ears, he went off into his working room, the other side of a partition wall, and closed the door after him.",
      "Idiotic woman!",
      "he said to himself, sat down to the table, and, opening a portfolio, he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun.",
      "Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife.",
      "damn them all!",
      "he thought as he went on working.",
      "He was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage.",
      "A sketch had been made before, but he was dissatisfied with it.",
      "No, that one was better ... where is it?",
      "He went back to his wife, and scowling, and not looking at her, asked his eldest little girl, where was that piece of paper he had given them?",
      "The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found, but it was dirty, and spotted with candle-grease.",
      "Still, he took the sketch, laid it on his table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his eyes, he fell to gazing at it.",
      "All at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully.",
      "That s it!",
      "he said, and, at once picking up the pencil, he began rapidly drawing.",
      "The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose.",
      "He had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a prominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this chin on to the figure of the man.",
      "He laughed aloud with delight.",
      "The figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never be changed.",
      "That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably defined.",
      "The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put differently, and the position of the left hand must be quite altered; the hair too might be thrown back.",
      "But in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure.",
      "He was, as it were, stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen.",
      "Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow.",
      "He was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him.",
      "Coming, coming!",
      "He went in to his wife.",
      "Come, Sasha, don t be cross!",
      "he said, smiling timidly and affectionately at her.",
      "You were to blame.",
      "I was to blame.",
      "I ll make it all right.",
      "And having made peace with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat, and went towards his studio.",
      "The successful figure he had already forgotten.",
      "Now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence, Russians, who had come in their carriage.",
      "Of his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction that no one had ever painted a picture like it.",
      "He did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of Raphael, but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture, no one ever had conveyed.",
      "This he knew positively, and had known a long while, ever since he had begun to paint it.",
      "But other people s criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense consequence in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his soul.",
      "Any remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture, agitated him to the depths of his soul.",
      "He always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself, and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture.",
      "And often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this.",
      "He walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna s figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was eagerly telling her something, while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist.",
      "He was himself unconscious how, as he approached them, he seized on this impression and absorbed it, as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it.",
      "The visitors, not agreeably impressed beforehand by Golenishtchev s account of the artist, were still less so by his personal appearance.",
      "Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble movements, with his brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow trousers though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion, most of all, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov made an unpleasant impression.",
      "Please step in, he said, trying to look indifferent, and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door.",
      "Chapter 11 On entering the studio, Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination Vronsky s expression too, and especially his jaws.",
      "Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he rapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of these three persons.",
      "That fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here.",
      "Mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him, nor what he had said to him.",
      "He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen; but he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression.",
      "The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression a petty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose.",
      "Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be, Mihailov supposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing nothing about art, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs.",
      "Most likely they ve already looked at all the antiques, and now they re making the round of the studios of the new people, the German humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have only come to me to make the point of view complete, he thought.",
      "He was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were the worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past, and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained.",
      "He expected all this; he saw it all in their faces, he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves, stared at the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely fashion, waiting for him to uncover his picture.",
      "But in spite of this, while he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.",
      "Here, if you please, he said, moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture, it s the exhortation to Pilate.",
      "Matthew, chapter xxvii, he said, feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion.",
      "He moved away and stood behind them.",
      "For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider.",
      "For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before.",
      "He forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him he saw the picture with their indifferent, new, outside eyes, and saw nothing good in it.",
      "He saw in the foreground Pilate s irritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the background the figures of Pilate s retinue and the face of John watching what was happening.",
      "Every face that, with such agony, such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character, every face that had given him such torments and such raptures, and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole, all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor all of this together seemed to him now, looking at it with their eyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been done a thousand times over.",
      "The face dearest to him, the face of Christ, the center of the picture, which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him, was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes.",
      "He saw a well-painted (no, not even that he distinctly saw now a mass of defects) repetition of those endless Christs of Titian, Raphael, Rubens, and the same soldiers and Pilate.",
      "It was all common, poor, and stale, and positively badly painted weak and unequal.",
      "They would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again.",
      "The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too intolerable to him.",
      "To break it, and to show he was not agitated, he made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.",
      "I think I ve had the pleasure of meeting you, he said, looking uneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any shade of their expression.",
      "We met at Rossi s, do you remember, at that _soir e_ when that Italian lady recited the new Rachel?",
      "Golenishtchev answered easily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist.",
      "Noticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture, he said: Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and what strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of Pilate.",
      "One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an official through and through, who does not know what it is he s doing.",
      "But I fancy.... All Mihailov s mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled.",
      "He tried to say something, but he could not speak for excitement, and pretended to be coughing.",
      "Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev s capacity for understanding art, trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an official, and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation.",
      "He had himself thought about Pilate s figure just what Golenishtchev said.",
      "The fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be true, did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev s remark.",
      "His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy.",
      "At once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living.",
      "Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood Pilate, but his lips quivered intractably, and he could not pronounce the words.",
      "Vronsky and Anna too said something in that subdued voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist s feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something silly so easily said when talking of art people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures.",
      "Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too.",
      "He went up to them.",
      "How marvelous Christ s expression is!",
      "Of all she saw she liked that expression most of all, and she felt that it was the center of the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.",
      "One can see that He is pitying Pilate.",
      "This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of Christ.",
      "She said that He was pitying Pilate.",
      "In Christ s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly peace, of readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words.",
      "Of course there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in Christ, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life.",
      "All this and much more flashed into Mihailov s thoughts.",
      "Yes, and how that figure is done what atmosphere!",
      "One can walk round it, said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.",
      "Yes, there s a wonderful mastery!",
      "How those figures in the background stand out!",
      "There you have technique, he said, addressing Golenishtchev, alluding to a conversation between them about Vronsky s despair of attaining this technique.",
      "Yes, yes, marvelous!",
      "Golenishtchev and Anna assented.",
      "In spite of the excited condition in which he was, the sentence about technique had sent a pang to Mihailov s heart, and looking angrily at Vronsky he suddenly scowled.",
      "He had often heard this word technique, and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it.",
      "He knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing, entirely apart from its subject.",
      "He had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality, as though one could paint well something that was bad.",
      "He knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid injuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but there was no art of painting no technique of any sort about it.",
      "If to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw, it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen.",
      "And the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first.",
      "Besides, he saw that if it came to talking about technique, it was impossible to praise him for it.",
      "In all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes, coming from want of care in taking off the wrappings faults he could not correct now without spoiling the whole.",
      "And in almost all the figures and faces he saw, too, remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture.",
      "One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark.... observed Golenishtchev.",
      "Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you, said Mihailov with a forced smile.",
      "That is, that you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man.",
      "But I know that was what you meant to do.",
      "I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart, said Mihailov gloomily.",
      "Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....",
      "Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it, and, besides, it is only my personal opinion.",
      "With you it is different.",
      "Your very motive is different.",
      "But let us take Ivanov.",
      "I imagine that if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character, it would have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical subject, fresh, untouched.",
      "But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?",
      "If one looked one would find others.",
      "But the point is that art cannot suffer doubt and discussion.",
      "And before the picture of Ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, Is it God, or is it not God?",
      "and the unity of the impression is destroyed.",
      "I think that for educated people, said Mihailov, the question cannot exist.",
      "Golenishtchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art.",
      "Mihailov was greatly perturbed, but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea.",
      "Chapter 12 Anna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting their friend s flow of cleverness.",
      "At last Vronsky, without waiting for the artist, walked away to another small picture.",
      "Oh, how exquisite!",
      "What a lovely thing!",
      "A gem!",
      "How exquisite!",
      "they cried with one voice.",
      "What is it they re so pleased with?",
      "thought Mihailov.",
      "He had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago.",
      "He had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night.",
      "He had forgotten, as he always forgot, the pictures he had finished.",
      "He did not even like to look at it, and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted to buy it.",
      "Oh, that s only an old study, he said.",
      "How fine!",
      "said Golenishtchev, he too, with unmistakable sincerity, falling under the spell of the picture.",
      "Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree.",
      "The elder had just dropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush, entirely absorbed in what he was doing.",
      "The other, a little younger, was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows, with his tangled, flaxen head in his hands, staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes.",
      "What was he thinking of?",
      "The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in Mihailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him, he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.",
      "But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale.",
      "To Mihailov at that moment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters.",
      "It is put up there to be sold, he answered, scowling gloomily.",
      "When the visitors had gone, Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of Pilate and Christ, and in his mind went over what had been said, and what, though not said, had been implied by those visitors.",
      "And, strange to say, what had had such weight with him, while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view, suddenly lost all importance for him.",
      "He began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility, and so of the significance, of his picture a conviction essential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other interests in which alone he could work.",
      "Christ s foreshortened leg was not right, though.",
      "He took his palette and began to work.",
      "As he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of John in the background, which his visitors had not even noticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection.",
      "When he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure, but he felt too much excited for it.",
      "He was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much.",
      "There was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration, at which work was possible.",
      "Today he was too much agitated.",
      "He would have covered the picture, but he stopped, holding the cloth in his hand, and, smiling blissfully, gazed a long while at the figure of John.",
      "At last, as it were regretfully tearing himself away, he dropped the cloth, and, exhausted but happy, went home.",
      "Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly lively and cheerful.",
      "They talked of Mihailov and his pictures.",
      "The word _talent_, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude apart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred particularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of it.",
      "They said that there was no denying his talent, but that his talent could not develop for want of education the common defect of our Russian artists.",
      "But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories, and they were continually coming back to it.",
      "What an exquisite thing!",
      "How he has succeeded in it, and how simply!",
      "He doesn t even comprehend how good it is.",
      "Yes, I mustn t let it slip; I must buy it, said Vronsky.",
      "Chapter 13 Mihailov sold Vronsky his picture, and agreed to paint a portrait of Anna.",
      "On the day fixed he came and began the work.",
      "From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone, especially Vronsky, not only by its resemblance, but by its characteristic beauty.",
      "It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty.",
      "One needs to know and love her as I have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul, Vronsky thought, though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul.",
      "But the expression was so true that he, and others too, fancied they had long known it.",
      "I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything, he said of his own portrait of her, and he just looked and painted it.",
      "That s where technique comes in.",
      "That will come, was the consoling reassurance given him by Golenishtchev, in whose view Vronsky had both talent, and what was most important, culture, giving him a wider outlook on art.",
      "Golenishtchev s faith in Vronsky s talent was propped up by his own need of Vronsky s sympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas, and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual.",
      "In another man s house, and especially in Vronsky s palazzo, Mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio.",
      "He behaved with hostile courtesy, as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect.",
      "He called Vronsky your excellency, and notwithstanding Anna s and Vronsky s invitations, he would never stay to dinner, nor come except for the sittings.",
      "Anna was even more friendly to him than to other people, and was very grateful for her portrait.",
      "Vronsky was more than cordial with him, and was obviously interested to know the artist s opinion of his picture.",
      "Golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into Mihailov.",
      "But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them.",
      "Anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her, but he avoided conversation with her.",
      "Vronsky s talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence, and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown Vronsky s picture.",
      "He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev s conversation, and he did not attempt to oppose him.",
      "Altogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were, hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up coming.",
      "Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous of Vronsky.",
      "Not envious, let us say, since he has _talent_; but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you know they all detest a title), can, without any particular trouble, do as well, if not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it.",
      "And more than all, it s a question of culture, which he is without.",
      "Vronsky defended Mihailov, but at the bottom of his heart he believed it, because in his view a man of a different, lower world would be sure to be envious.",
      "Anna s portrait the same subject painted from nature both by him and by Mihailov ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him and Mihailov; but he did not see it.",
      "Only after Mihailov s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait of Anna, deciding that it was now not needed.",
      "His picture of medi val life he went on with.",
      "And he himself, and Golenishtchev, and still more Anna, thought it very good, because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than Mihailov s picture.",
      "Mihailov meanwhile, although Anna s portrait greatly fascinated him, was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over, and he had no longer to listen to Golenishtchev s disquisitions upon art, and could forget about Vronsky s painting.",
      "He knew that Vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting; he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked, but it was distasteful to him.",
      "A man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll, and kissing it.",
      "But if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love, and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved, it would be distasteful to the lover.",
      "Just such a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of Vronsky s painting: he felt it both ludicrous and irritating, both pitiable and offensive.",
      "Vronsky s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.",
      "He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.",
      "The picture came to a standstill.",
      "He was vaguely aware that its defects, inconspicuous at first, would be glaring if he were to go on with it.",
      "The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev, who felt that he had nothing to say, and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature, that he was working it out and collecting materials.",
      "This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but Vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more incapable of exasperation.",
      "With his characteristic decision, without explanation or apology, he simply ceased working at painting.",
      "But without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who wondered at his loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably tedious in an Italian town.",
      "The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the everlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and the German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some change.",
      "They resolved to go to Russia, to the country.",
      "In Petersburg Vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother, while Anna meant to see her son.",
      "The summer they intended to spend on Vronsky s great family estate.",
      "Chapter 14 Levin had been married three months.",
      "He was happy, but not at all in the way he had expected to be.",
      "At every step he found his former dreams disappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness.",
      "He was happy; but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined.",
      "At every step he experienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth, happy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that little boat.",
      "He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating smoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where one was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must row; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was only to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very delightful, was very difficult.",
      "As a bachelor, when he had watched other people s married life, seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart.",
      "In his future married life there could be, he was convinced, nothing of that sort; even the external forms, indeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything.",
      "And all of a sudden, instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the pettiest details, which he had so despised before, but which now, by no will of his own, had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against.",
      "And Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before.",
      "Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract.",
      "He ought, as he conceived the position, to do his work, and to find repose from it in the happiness of love.",
      "She ought to be beloved, and nothing more.",
      "But, like all men, he forgot that she too would want work.",
      "And he was surprised that she, his poetic, exquisite Kitty, could, not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first days of their married life, think, remember, and busy herself about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for visitors, about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on.",
      "While they were still engaged, he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country, as though she knew of something she wanted, and could still think of something outside her love.",
      "This had jarred upon him then, and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times.",
      "But he saw that this was essential for her.",
      "And, loving her as he did, though he did not understand the reason of them, and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them.",
      "He jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow; rearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors; a room for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna, taking from her the charge of the stores.",
      "He saw how the old cook smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced, impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress s new arrangements.",
      "He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell him that her maid, Masha, was used to looking upon her as her young lady, and so no one obeyed her.",
      "It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and he thought it would have been better without this.",
      "He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she, who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without the possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any puddings she pleased.",
      "She was dreaming with delight now of Dolly s coming to them with her children, especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.",
      "She did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her.",
      "Instinctively feeling the approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.",
      "This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin s ideal of exalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this sweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not understand, but could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.",
      "Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels.",
      "Levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once in the very early days they quarreled, so that she said he did not care for her, that he cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and wrung her arms.",
      "This first quarrel arose from Levin s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way.",
      "He drove home thinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own happiness, and the nearer he drew to home, the warmer was his tenderness for her.",
      "He ran into the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys house to make his offer.",
      "And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her.",
      "He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.",
      "You ve been enjoying yourself, she began, trying to be calm and spiteful.",
      "But as soon as she opened her mouth, a stream of reproach, of senseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window, burst from her.",
      "It was only then, for the first time, that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding.",
      "He felt now that he was not simply close to her, but that he did not know where he ended and she began.",
      "He felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant.",
      "He was offended for the first instant, but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her, that she was himself.",
      "He felt for the first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received a violent blow from behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge himself, to look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry with, and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain.",
      "Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity, but this first time he could not for a long while get over it.",
      "His natural feeling urged him to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering.",
      "One habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.",
      "Another feeling, even stronger, impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater.",
      "To remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched, but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still.",
      "Like a man half-awake in an agony of pain, he wanted to tear out, to fling away the aching place, and coming to his senses, he felt that the aching place was himself.",
      "He could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it, and this he tried to do.",
      "They made peace.",
      "She, recognizing that she was wrong, though she did not say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced new, redoubled happiness in their love.",
      "But that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and trivial grounds.",
      "These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper.",
      "When one was in a good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken; but when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about.",
      "It is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled.",
      "But still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them.",
      "During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension, as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound.",
      "Altogether their honeymoon that is to say, the month after their wedding from which from tradition Levin expected so much, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives.",
      "They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period, when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite themselves.",
      "It was only in the third month of their married life, after their return from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, that their life began to go more smoothly.",
      "Chapter 15 They had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone.",
      "He was sitting at the writing-table in his study, writing.",
      "She, wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life, and put on again today, a dress particularly remembered and loved by him, was sitting on the sofa, the same old-fashioned leather sofa which had always stood in the study in Levin s father s and grandfather s days.",
      "She was sewing at _broderie anglaise_.",
      "He thought and wrote, never losing the happy consciousness of her presence.",
      "His work, both on the land and on the book, in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down, had not been abandoned; but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life, now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness.",
      "He went on with his work, but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else, and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly.",
      "Formerly this work had been for him an escape from life.",
      "Formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy.",
      "Now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright.",
      "Taking up his manuscript, reading through what he had written, he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at.",
      "Many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme, but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory.",
      "He was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia.",
      "He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon Russia, especially facilities of communication, as railways, leading to centralization in towns, the development of luxury, and the consequent development of manufactures, credit and its accompaniment of speculation all to the detriment of agriculture.",
      "It seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture, when it had come under regular, or at least definite, conditions; that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally, and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land, railways, called into being by political and not by economic needs, were premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected of them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress; and that just as the one-sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development, so in the general development of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of communication, manufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe, where they had arisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm, by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement the question of the organization of agriculture.",
      "While he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky, who had, with great want of tact, flirted with her the day before they left Moscow.",
      "He s jealous, she thought.",
      "Goodness!",
      "how sweet and silly he is!",
      "He s jealous of me!",
      "If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr the cook, she thought, looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself.",
      "Though it s a pity to take him from his work (but he has plenty of time!",
      "), I must look at his face; will he feel I m looking at him?",
      "I wish he d turn round ...",
      "I ll _will_ him to!",
      "and she opened her eyes wide, as though to intensify the influence of her gaze.",
      "Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity, he muttered, stopping to write, and, feeling that she was looking at him and smiling, he looked round.",
      "he queried, smiling, and getting up.",
      "He looked round, she thought.",
      "It s nothing; I wanted you to look round, she said, watching him, and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not.",
      "How happy we are alone together!",
      "I am, that is, he said, going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness.",
      "I m just as happy.",
      "I ll never go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.",
      "And what were you thinking about?",
      "I was thinking.... No, no, go along, go on writing; don t break off, she said, pursing up her lips, and I must cut out these little holes now, do you see?",
      "She took up her scissors and began cutting them out.",
      "No; tell me, what was it?",
      "he said, sitting down beside her and watching the tiny scissors moving round.",
      "what was I thinking about?",
      "I was thinking about Moscow, about the back of your head.",
      "Why should I, of all people, have such happiness!",
      "It s unnatural, too good, he said, kissing her hand.",
      "I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more natural it seems to me.",
      "And you ve got a little curl loose, he said, carefully turning her head round.",
      "A little curl, oh yes.",
      "No, no, we are busy at our work!",
      "Work did not progress further, and they darted apart from one another like culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.",
      "Have they come from the town?",
      "Levin asked Kouzma.",
      "They ve just come; they re unpacking the things.",
      "Come quickly, she said to him as she went out of the study, or else I shall read your letters without you.",
      "Left alone, after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her, he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings, that had all made their appearance with her.",
      "Levin smiled at his own thoughts, and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him.",
      "There was something shameful, effeminate, Capuan, as he called it to himself, in his present mode of life.",
      "It s not right to go on like this, he thought.",
      "It ll soon be three months, and I m doing next to nothing.",
      "Today, almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
      "I did nothing but begin and throw it aside.",
      "Even my ordinary pursuits I have almost given up.",
      "On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things.",
      "Either I am loath to leave her, or I see she s dull alone.",
      "And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing much, somehow didn t count, but that after marriage, life began in earnest.",
      "And here almost three months have passed, and I have spent my time so idly and unprofitably.",
      "No, this won t do; I must begin.",
      "Of course, it s not her fault.",
      "She s not to blame in any way.",
      "I ought myself to be firmer, to maintain my masculine independence of action; or else I shall get into such ways, and she ll get used to them too.... Of course she s not to blame, he told himself.",
      "But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else, and especially the person nearest of all to him, for the ground of his dissatisfaction.",
      "And it vaguely came into Levin s mind that she herself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything), but what was to blame was her education, too superficial and frivolous.",
      "( That fool Tcharsky: she wanted, I know, to stop him, but didn t know how to. )",
      "Yes, apart from her interest in the house (that she has), apart from dress and _broderie anglaise_, she has no serious interests.",
      "No interest in her work, in the estate, in the peasants, nor in music, though she s rather good at it, nor in reading.",
      "She does nothing, and is perfectly satisfied.",
      "Levin, in his heart, censured this, and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house, and would bear, and nurse, and bring up children.",
      "He knew not that she was instinctively aware of this, and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil, did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future.",
      "Chapter 16 When Levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old Agafea Mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a letter from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence.",
      "You see, your good lady s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with her, said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at Kitty.",
      "In these words of Agafea Mihalovna, Levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty.",
      "He saw that, in spite of Agafea Mihalovna s feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands, Kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her.",
      "Here, I opened your letter too, said Kitty, handing him an illiterate letter.",
      "It s from that woman, I think, your brother s.... she said.",
      "I did not read it through.",
      "This is from my people and from Dolly.",
      "Fancy!",
      "Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children s ball at the Sarmatskys : Tanya was a French marquise.",
      "But Levin did not hear her.",
      "Flushing, he took the letter from Marya Nikolaevna, his brother s former mistress, and began to read it.",
      "This was the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "In the first letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away for no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though she was in want again, she asked for nothing, and wished for nothing, but was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would come to grief without her, owing to the weak state of his health, and begged his brother to look after him.",
      "Now she wrote quite differently.",
      "She had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in Moscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had received a post in the government service.",
      "But that he had quarreled with the head official, and was on his way back to Moscow, only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again, she wrote.",
      "It s always of you he has talked, and, besides, he has no more money left.",
      "Read this; Dolly writes about you, Kitty was beginning, with a smile; but she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her husband s face.",
      "She writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death s door.",
      "I shall go to him.",
      "Kitty s face changed at once.",
      "Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise, of Dolly, all had vanished.",
      "When are you going?",
      "And I will go with you, can I?",
      "What are you thinking of?",
      "he said reproachfully.",
      "offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation.",
      "Why shouldn t I go?",
      "I shan t be in your way.",
      "I m going because my brother is dying, said Levin.",
      "Why should you.... Why?",
      "For the same reason as you.",
      "And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her being dull by herself, thought Levin.",
      "And this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him.",
      "It s out of the question, he said sternly.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put down her cup and withdrew.",
      "Kitty did not even notice her.",
      "The tone in which her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said.",
      "I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly come, she said hastily and wrathfully.",
      "Why out of the question?",
      "Why do you say it s out of the question?",
      "Because it ll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels.",
      "You would be a hindrance to me, said Levin, trying to be cool.",
      "I don t want anything.",
      "Where you can go, I can.... Well, for one thing then, because this woman s there whom you can t meet.",
      "I don t know and don t care to know who s there and what.",
      "I know that my husband s brother is dying and my husband is going to him, and I go with my husband too.... Kitty!",
      "Don t get angry.",
      "But just think a little: this is a matter of such importance that I can t bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone.",
      "Come, you ll be dull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a little.",
      "There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me, she said with tears of wounded pride and fury.",
      "I didn t mean, it wasn t weakness, it wasn t ...",
      "I feel that it s my duty to be with my husband when he s in trouble, but you try on purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to understand.... No; this is awful!",
      "To be such a slave!",
      "cried Levin, getting up, and unable to restrain his anger any longer.",
      "But at the same second he felt that he was beating himself.",
      "Then why did you marry?",
      "You could have been free.",
      "Why did you, if you regret it?",
      "she said, getting up and running away into the drawing-room.",
      "When he went to her, she was sobbing.",
      "He began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her.",
      "But she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.",
      "He bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him.",
      "He kissed her hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand again still she was silent.",
      "But when he took her face in both his hands and said Kitty!",
      "she suddenly recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.",
      "It was decided that they should go together the next day.",
      "Levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use, agreed that Marya Nikolaevna s being with his brother did not make her going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself.",
      "He was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he, so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love him now was unhappy because she loved him too much!",
      "), and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will.",
      "Even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother, and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with.",
      "The mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same room with a common wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing.",
      "Chapter 17 The hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness, comfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes them, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the old-fashioned, honestly filthy hotels.",
      "This hotel had already reached that stage, and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry, supposed to stand for a hall-porter, and the cast-iron, slippery, dark, and disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat, and the common dining-room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table, and filth, dust, and disorder everywhere, and at the same time the sort of modern up-to-date self-complacent railway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most painful feeling in Levin after their fresh young life, especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them.",
      "As is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room for them; one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, another by a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva from the country.",
      "There remained only one filthy room, next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening.",
      "Feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass, which was that at the moment of arrival, when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on, he should have to be seeing after her, instead of rushing straight to his brother, Levin conducted her to the room assigned them.",
      "Go, do go!",
      "she said, looking at him with timid and guilty eyes.",
      "He went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled over Marya Nikolaevna, who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him.",
      "She was just the same as when he saw her in Moscow; the same woolen gown, and bare arms and neck, and the same good-naturedly stupid, pockmarked face, only a little plumper.",
      "Well, how is he?",
      "how is he?",
      "Very bad.",
      "He can t get up.",
      "He has kept expecting you.",
      "He.... Are you ... with your wife?",
      "Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her, but she immediately enlightened him.",
      "I ll go away.",
      "I ll go down to the kitchen, she brought out.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch will be delighted.",
      "He heard about it, and knows your lady, and remembers her abroad.",
      "Levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to make.",
      "Come along, come along to him!",
      "But as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped out.",
      "Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had put herself and him in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna crimsoned still more.",
      "She positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands, twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do.",
      "For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible to her; but it lasted only a single instant.",
      "Well!",
      "she turned to her husband and then to her.",
      "But one can t go on talking in the passage like this!",
      "Levin said, looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor, as though about his affairs.",
      "Well then, come in, said Kitty, turning to Marya Nikolaevna, who had recovered herself, but noticing her husband s face of dismay, or go on; go, and then come for me, she said, and went back into the room.",
      "Levin went to his brother s room.",
      "He had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his brother s room.",
      "He had expected to find him in the same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his brother s visit in the autumn.",
      "He had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more marked greater weakness, greater emaciation, but still almost the same condition of things.",
      "He had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then, only in a greater degree.",
      "And he had prepared himself for this; but he found something utterly different.",
      "In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a bedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a body.",
      "One arm of this body was above the quilt, and the wrist, huge as a rake-handle, was attached, inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle.",
      "The head lay sideways on the pillow.",
      "Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense, transparent-looking forehead.",
      "It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?",
      "But he went closer, saw the face, and doubt became impossible.",
      "In spite of the terrible change in the face, Levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach, only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache, to realize the terrible truth that this death-like body was his living brother.",
      "The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he drew near.",
      "And immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men.",
      "Levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him, and felt remorse at his own happiness.",
      "When Konstantin took him by the hand, Nikolay smiled.",
      "The smile was faint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged.",
      "You did not expect to find me like this, he articulated with effort.",
      "Yes ... no, said Levin, hesitating over his words.",
      "How was it you didn t let me know before, that is, at the time of my wedding?",
      "I made inquiries in all directions.",
      "He had to talk so as not to be silent, and he did not know what to say, especially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared without dropping his eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word.",
      "Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him.",
      "Nikolay expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition.",
      "Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and began to say something.",
      "Levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face, but Nikolay began speaking of his health.",
      "He found fault with the doctor, regretting he had not a celebrated Moscow doctor.",
      "Levin saw that he still hoped.",
      "Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape, if only for an instant, from his agonizing emotion, and said that he would go and fetch his wife.",
      "Very well, and I ll tell her to tidy up here.",
      "It s dirty and stinking here, I expect.",
      "Marya!",
      "clear up the room, the sick man said with effort.",
      "Oh, and when you ve cleared up, go away yourself, he added, looking inquiringly at his brother.",
      "Levin made no answer.",
      "Going out into the corridor, he stopped short.",
      "He had said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion he was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade her not to go in to the sick man.",
      "Why should she suffer as I am suffering?",
      "Kitty asked with a frightened face.",
      "Oh, it s awful, it s awful!",
      "What did you come for?",
      "Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her husband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.",
      "take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.",
      "You only take me, take me to him, please, and go away, she said.",
      "You must understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more painful.",
      "There I might be a help to you and to him.",
      "Please, let me!",
      "she besought her husband, as though the happiness of her life depended on it.",
      "Levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely forgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his brother with Kitty.",
      "Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him a valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-room, and, turning without haste, noiselessly closed the door.",
      "With inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man s bedside, and going up so that he had not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with that soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to women.",
      "We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden, she said.",
      "You never thought I was to be your sister?",
      "You would not have recognized me?",
      "he said, with a radiant smile at her entrance.",
      "Yes, I should.",
      "What a good thing you let us know!",
      "Not a day has passed that Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.",
      "But the sick man s interest did not last long.",
      "Before she had finished speaking, there had come back into his face the stern, reproachful expression of the dying man s envy of the living.",
      "I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here, she said, turning away from his fixed stare, and looking about the room.",
      "We must ask about another room, she said to her husband, so that we might be nearer.",
      "Chapter 18 Levin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence.",
      "When he went in to the sick man, his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother s position.",
      "He smelt the awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition, and heard the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help.",
      "It never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man s situation, to consider how that body was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up, and whether they could not be made more comfortable, whether anything could not be done to make things, if not better, at least less bad.",
      "It made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details.",
      "He was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother s life or to relieve his suffering.",
      "But a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him.",
      "And this made it still more painful for Levin.",
      "To be in the sick-room was agony to him, not to be there still worse.",
      "And he was continually, on various pretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was unable to remain alone.",
      "But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently.",
      "On seeing the sick man, she pitied him.",
      "And pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state, and to remedy them.",
      "And since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible, and immediately set to work.",
      "The very details, the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention.",
      "She sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist s, set the maid who had come with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she herself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something under the quilt.",
      "Something was by her directions brought into the sick-room, something else was carried out.",
      "She herself went several times to her room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got out and brought in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.",
      "The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall, came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons, and could not avoid carrying out her orders, as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her.",
      "Levin did not approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient.",
      "Above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it.",
      "But the sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not angry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what she was doing with him.",
      "Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had sent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the instant when, by Kitty s directions, they were changing his linen.",
      "The long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not get the long, limp arm into it.",
      "Kitty, hurriedly closing the door after Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and she moved rapidly towards him.",
      "Make haste, she said.",
      "Oh, don t you come, said the sick man angrily.",
      "I ll do it my myself.... What say?",
      "queried Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "But Kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.",
      "I m not looking, I m not looking!",
      "she said, putting the arm in.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it, she added.",
      "Please go for me, there s a little bottle in my small bag, she said, turning to her husband, you know, in the side pocket; bring it, please, and meanwhile they ll finish clearing up here.",
      "Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed.",
      "The heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting lips and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe.",
      "There was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside.",
      "On the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the linen needed was folded up there, and Kitty s _broderie anglaise_.",
      "On the other table by the patient s bed there were candles and drink and powders.",
      "The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at Kitty.",
      "The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the one who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was dissatisfied with him.",
      "The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to.",
      "He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer water, with warm milk at a certain temperature.",
      "When the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother, of which Levin could distinguish only the last words: Your Katya.",
      "By the expression with which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he was praising her.",
      "He called indeed to Katya, as he called her.",
      "I m much better already, he said.",
      "Why, with you I should have got well long ago.",
      "How nice it is!",
      "he took her hand and drew it towards his lips, but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind, let it go, and only stroked it.",
      "Kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it.",
      "Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed, he said.",
      "No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood.",
      "She understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed.",
      "On the other side, she said to her husband, he always sleeps on that side.",
      "Turn him over, it s so disagreeable calling the servants.",
      "I m not strong enough.",
      "Can you?",
      "she said to Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "I m afraid not, answered Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "Terrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body, to take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know nothing, under his wife s influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body, but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs.",
      "While he was turning him over, conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man s head, smoothing back his hair, which was sticking again to his moist brow.",
      "The sick man kept his brother s hand in his own.",
      "Levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere.",
      "Levin yielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it to his mouth and kissed it.",
      "Levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word, went out of the room.",
      "Chapter 19 Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.",
      "So Levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening.",
      "Levin thought of the text, not because he considered himself wise and prudent.",
      "He did not so consider himself, but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna, and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death, he thought with all the force of his intellect.",
      "He knew too that the brains of many great men, whose thoughts he had read, had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew about it.",
      "Different as those two women were, Agafea Mihalovna and Katya, as his brother Nikolay had called her, and as Levin particularly liked to call her now, they were quite alike in this.",
      "Both knew, without a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was and what was death, and though neither of them could have answered, and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin, both had no doubt of the significance of this event, and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it, which they shared with millions of people.",
      "The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying, and were not frightened of them.",
      "Levin and other men like him, though they could have said a great deal about death, obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying.",
      "If Levin had been alone now with his brother Nikolay, he would have looked at him with terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have known what else to do.",
      "More than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.",
      "To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk of death and depressing subjects also impossible.",
      "To be silent, also impossible.",
      "If I look at him he will think I am studying him, I am afraid; if I don t look at him, he ll think I m thinking of other things.",
      "If I walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to tread firmly, I m ashamed.",
      "Kitty evidently did not think of herself, and had no time to think about herself: she was thinking about him because she knew something, and all went well.",
      "She told him about herself even and about her wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him, and talked of cases of recovery and all went well; so then she must know.",
      "The proof that her behavior and Agafea Mihalovna s was not instinctive, animal, irrational, was that apart from the physical treatment, the relief of suffering, both Agafea Mihalovna and Kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment, and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, speaking of the man just dead, had said: Well, thank God, he took the sacrament and received absolution; God grant each one of us such a death.",
      "Katya in just the same way, besides all her care about linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution.",
      "On getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the night, Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do.",
      "Not to speak of supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to do, he could not even talk to his wife; he was ashamed to.",
      "Kitty, on the contrary, was more active than usual.",
      "She was even livelier than usual.",
      "She ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things, and herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to sprinkle them with Persian powder.",
      "She showed that alertness, that swiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle, in conflict, in the dangerous and decisive moments of life those moments when a man shows once and for all his value, and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.",
      "Everything went rapidly in her hands, and before it was twelve o clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms, in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made, brushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins were spread.",
      "Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now, and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly.",
      "She arranged the brushes, but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it.",
      "They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they could not sleep, and did not even go to bed.",
      "I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow, she said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking-glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb.",
      "I have never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are prayers said for recovery.",
      "Do you suppose he can possibly recover?",
      "said Levin, watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front.",
      "I asked the doctor; he said he couldn t live more than three days.",
      "But can they be sure?",
      "I m very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him, she said, looking askance at her husband through her hair.",
      "Anything is possible, she added with that peculiar, rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion.",
      "Since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on, always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so.",
      "In spite of his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch holes, but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.",
      "Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to manage all this, said Levin.",
      "And ...",
      "I must own I m very, very glad you came.",
      "You are such purity that....",
      "He took her hand and did not kiss it (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her brightening eyes.",
      "It would have been miserable for you to be alone, she said, and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there.",
      "No, she went on, she did not know how.... Luckily, I learned a lot at Soden.",
      "Surely there are not people there so ill?",
      "Worse.",
      "What s so awful to me is that I can t see him as he was when he was young.",
      "You would not believe how charming he was as a youth, but I did not understand him then.",
      "I can quite, quite believe it.",
      "How I feel that we might have been friends!",
      "she said; and, distressed at what she had said, she looked round at her husband, and tears came into her eyes.",
      "Yes, _might have been_, he said mournfully.",
      "He s just one of those people of whom they say they re not for this world.",
      "But we have many days before us; we must go to bed, said Kitty, glancing at her tiny watch.",
      "Chapter 20 The next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.",
      "During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently.",
      "His great eyes, fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card-table covered with a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to Levin to see it.",
      "Levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so loved.",
      "Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.",
      "Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of.",
      "Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, lifted with difficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense brow, and the prominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for.",
      "During the sacrament Levin did what he, an unbeliever, had done a thousand times.",
      "He said, addressing God, If Thou dost exist, make this man to recover (of course this same thing has been repeated many times), and Thou wilt save him and me.",
      "After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better.",
      "He did not cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty s hand, thanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from pain, and that he felt strong and had an appetite.",
      "He even raised himself when his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well.",
      "Hopelessly ill as he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover, Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement, happy, though fearful of being mistaken.",
      "Is he better?",
      "Yes, much.",
      "It s wonderful.",
      "There s nothing wonderful in it.",
      "Anyway, he s better, they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.",
      "This self-deception was not of long duration.",
      "The sick man fell into a quiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough.",
      "And all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself.",
      "The reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in the sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.",
      "Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as though ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper.",
      "Levin gave him the bottle, and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.",
      "Is Katya not here?",
      "he gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly assented to the doctor s words.",
      "No; so I can say it....",
      "It was for her sake I went through that farce.",
      "She s so sweet; but you and I can t deceive ourselves.",
      "This is what I believe in, he said, and, squeezing the bottle in his bony hand, he began breathing over it.",
      "At eight o clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly.",
      "She was pale, and her lips were quivering.",
      "He is dying!",
      "she whispered.",
      "I m afraid will die this minute.",
      "Both of them ran to him.",
      "He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.",
      "How do you feel?",
      "Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.",
      "I feel I m setting off, Nikolay said with difficulty, but with extreme distinctness, screwing the words out of himself.",
      "He did not raise his head, but simply turned his eyes upwards, without their reaching his brother s face.",
      "Katya, go away!",
      "Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.",
      "I m setting off, he said again.",
      "Why do you think so?",
      "said Levin, so as to say something.",
      "Because I m setting off, he repeated, as though he had a liking for the phrase.",
      "It s the end.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna went up to him.",
      "You had better lie down; you d be easier, she said.",
      "I shall lie down soon enough, he pronounced slowly, when I m dead, he said sarcastically, wrathfully.",
      "Well, you can lay me down if you like.",
      "Levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at his face, holding his breath.",
      "The dying man lay with closed eyes, but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one thinking deeply and intensely.",
      "Levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that calm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.",
      "Yes, yes, so, the dying man articulated slowly at intervals.",
      "Wait a little.",
      "He was silent.",
      "Right!",
      "he pronounced all at once reassuringly, as though all were solved for him.",
      "O Lord!",
      "he murmured, and sighed deeply.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet.",
      "They re getting cold, she whispered.",
      "For a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man lay motionless.",
      "But he was still alive, and from time to time he sighed.",
      "Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain.",
      "He felt that, with no mental effort, could he understand what it was that was _right_.",
      "He could not even think of the problem of death itself, but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next; closing the dead man s eyes, dressing him, ordering the coffin.",
      "And, strange to say, he felt utterly cold, and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss, less still of pity for his brother.",
      "If he had any feeling for his brother at that moment, it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have.",
      "A long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end.",
      "But the end did not come.",
      "The door opened and Kitty appeared.",
      "Levin got up to stop her.",
      "But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound of the dying man stirring.",
      "Don t go away, said Nikolay and held out his hand.",
      "Levin gave him his, and angrily waved to his wife to go away.",
      "With the dying man s hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an hour, another hour.",
      "He did not think of death at all now.",
      "He wondered what Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor lived in a house of his own.",
      "He longed for food and for sleep.",
      "He cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet.",
      "The feet were cold, but the sick man was still breathing.",
      "Levin tried again to move away on tiptoe, but the sick man stirred again and said: Don t go.",
      "The dawn came; the sick man s condition was unchanged.",
      "Levin stealthily withdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to his own room and went to sleep.",
      "When he woke up, instead of news of his brother s death which he expected, he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition.",
      "He had begun sitting up again, coughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased to talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his recovery, and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever.",
      "No one, neither his brother nor Kitty, could soothe him.",
      "He was angry with everyone, and said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his sufferings, and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from Moscow.",
      "To all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness, I m suffering horribly, intolerably!",
      "The sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores, which it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry with everyone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially for not having brought him a doctor from Moscow.",
      "Kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and Levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally, though she would not admit it.",
      "The sense of death, which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother, was broken up.",
      "Everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon, that he was half dead already.",
      "Everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing this, gave him medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and deceived him and themselves and each other.",
      "All this was falsehood, disgusting, irreverent deceit.",
      "And owing to the bent of his character, and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit.",
      "Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, and having received an answer from him, he read this letter to the sick man.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself, and in touching terms he begged his brother s forgiveness.",
      "The sick man said nothing.",
      "What am I to write to him?",
      "I hope you are not angry with him?",
      "No, not the least!",
      "Nikolay answered, vexed at the question.",
      "Tell him to send me a doctor.",
      "Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same condition.",
      "The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all the people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna and Levin and Kitty.",
      "The sick man alone did not express this feeling, but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and went on taking medicine and talking of life.",
      "Only at rare moments, when the opium gave him an instant s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he would sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others: Oh, if it were only the end!",
      "or: When will it be over?",
      "His sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and prepared him for death.",
      "There was no position in which he was not in pain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it, not a limb, not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony.",
      "Even the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself.",
      "The sight of other people, their remarks, his own reminiscences, everything was for him a source of agony.",
      "Those about him felt this, and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes before him.",
      "All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it.",
      "There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness.",
      "Hitherto each individual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger, fatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure.",
      "But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering.",
      "And so all desires were merged in one the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source, the body.",
      "But he had no words to express this desire of deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied.",
      "Turn me over on the other side, he would say, and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before.",
      "Give me some broth.",
      "Take away the broth.",
      "Talk of something: why are you silent?",
      "And directly they began to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness, indifference, and loathing.",
      "On the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell.",
      "She suffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the morning.",
      "The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement, and prescribed rest.",
      "After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to the sick man.",
      "He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell.",
      "That day he was continually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.",
      "she asked him.",
      "Worse, he articulated with difficulty.",
      "In pain!",
      "In pain, where?",
      "Everywhere.",
      "It will be over today, you will see, said Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "Though it was said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin had noticed was very keen, must have heard.",
      "Levin said hush to her, and looked round at the sick man.",
      "Nikolay had heard; but these words produced no effect on him.",
      "His eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.",
      "Levin asked her, when she had followed him into the corridor.",
      "He has begun picking at himself, said Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "Like this, she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt.",
      "Levin noticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it were, trying to snatch something away.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna s prediction came true.",
      "Towards night the sick man was not able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes.",
      "Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked just the same.",
      "Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying.",
      "While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of life; his eyes were closed.",
      "Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at the bedside.",
      "The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes.",
      "The priest, on finishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly returned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in silence, he touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.",
      "He is gone, said the priest, and would have moved away; but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds: Not quite ... soon.",
      "And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the mustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse.",
      "The sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the nearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him.",
      "This feeling was now even stronger than before; even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever.",
      "But now, thanks to his wife s presence, that feeling did not reduce him to despair.",
      "In spite of death, he felt the need of life and love.",
      "He felt that love saved him from despair, and that this love, under the menace of despair, had become still stronger and purer.",
      "The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had scarcely passed before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as insoluble, urging him to love and to life.",
      "The doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty.",
      "Her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child.",
      "Chapter 21 From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her with his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not know himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs, he met everything with unqualified assent.",
      "It was only when Anna had left his house, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position, and was appalled by it.",
      "Most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now.",
      "It was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him.",
      "The transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already; that state was painful, but he could understand it.",
      "If his wife had then, on declaring to him her unfaithfulness, left him, he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he would not have been in the hopeless position incomprehensible to himself in which he felt himself now.",
      "He could not now reconcile his immediate past, his tenderness, his love for his sick wife, and for the other man s child with what was now the case, that is with the fact that, as it were, in return for all this he now found himself alone, put to shame, a laughing-stock, needed by no one, and despised by everyone.",
      "For the first two days after his wife s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary, drove to the committee, and went down to dinner in the dining-room as usual.",
      "Without giving himself a reason for what he was doing, he strained every nerve of his being for those two days, simply to preserve an appearance of composure, and even of indifference.",
      "Answering inquiries about the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna s rooms and belongings, he had exercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events, and he attained his aim: no one could have detected in him signs of despair.",
      "But on the second day after her departure, when Korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper s shop, which Anna had forgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up.",
      "Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you.",
      "But if you direct us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us with her address?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, as it seemed to the clerk, and all at once, turning round, he sat down at the table.",
      "Letting his head sink into his hands, he sat for a long while in that position, several times attempted to speak and stopped short.",
      "Korney, perceiving his master s emotion, asked the clerk to call another time.",
      "Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer.",
      "He gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and for no one to be admitted, and he did not go down to dinner.",
      "He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation, which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of Korney, and of everyone, without exception, whom he had met during those two days.",
      "He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in that case he could have tried to be better), but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy.",
      "He knew that for this, for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to him.",
      "He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain.",
      "He knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to do this for two days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.",
      "His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow.",
      "In all Petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling, who would feel for him, not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as a suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan.",
      "There were two brothers.",
      "They did not remember their father, and their mother died when Alexey Alexandrovitch was ten years old.",
      "The property was a small one.",
      "Their uncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, at one time a favorite of the late Tsar, had brought them up.",
      "On completing his high school and university courses with medals, Alexey Alexandrovitch had, with his uncle s aid, immediately started in a prominent position in the service, and from that time forward he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition.",
      "In the high school and the university, and afterwards in the service, Alexey Alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone.",
      "His brother had been the person nearest to his heart, but he had a post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was always abroad, where he had died shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch s marriage.",
      "While he was governor of a province, Anna s aunt, a wealthy provincial lady, had thrown him middle-aged as he was, though young for a governor with her niece, and had succeeded in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation.",
      "There were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt.",
      "But Anna s aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl, and that he was in honor bound to make her an offer.",
      "He made the offer, and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable.",
      "The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others.",
      "And now among all his acquaintances he had not one friend.",
      "He had plenty of so-called connections, but no friendships.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner, to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about, whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help, with whom he could candidly discuss other people s business and affairs of state.",
      "But his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart.",
      "There was one man, a comrade of his at the university, with whom he had made friends later, and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this friend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of Russia.",
      "Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor.",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a straightforward, intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill.",
      "But their five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations.",
      "After signing the papers brought him, Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several times he attempted to speak, but could not.",
      "He had already prepared the phrase: You have heard of my trouble?",
      "But he ended by saying, as usual: So you ll get this ready for me?",
      "and with that dismissed him.",
      "The other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling for him; but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry.",
      "Of his women friends, foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Alexey Alexandrovitch never thought.",
      "All women, simply as women, were terrible and distasteful to him.",
      "Chapter 22 Alexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, but she had not forgotten him.",
      "At the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him, and without waiting to be announced, walked straight into his study.",
      "She found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands.",
      "_J ai forc la consigne_, she said, walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise.",
      "I have heard all!",
      "Dear friend!",
      "she went on, warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, frowning, got up, and disengaging his hand, moved her a chair.",
      "Won t you sit down, countess?",
      "I m seeing no one because I m unwell, countess, he said, and his lips twitched.",
      "repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking her eyes off his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners, describing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow face became still uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry.",
      "And he too was softened; he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it.",
      "she said in a voice breaking with emotion.",
      "You ought not to give way to grief.",
      "Your sorrow is a great one, but you ought to find consolation.",
      "I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, letting go her hand, but still gazing into her brimming eyes.",
      "My position is so awful because I can find nowhere, I cannot find within me strength to support me.",
      "You will find support; seek it not in me, though I beseech you to believe in my friendship, she said, with a sigh.",
      "Our support is love, that love that He has vouchsafed us.",
      "His burden is light, she said, with the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well.",
      "He will be your support and your succor.",
      "Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in Petersburg, and which seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch disproportionate, still it was pleasant to him to hear this now.",
      "I am weak.",
      "I am crushed.",
      "I foresaw nothing, and now I understand nothing.",
      "Dear friend, repeated Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "It s not the loss of what I have not now, it s not that!",
      "pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I do not grieve for that.",
      "But I cannot help feeling humiliated before other people for the position I am placed in.",
      "It is wrong, but I can t help it, I can t help it.",
      "Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was moved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within your heart, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising her eyes rapturously, and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he cracked his fingers.",
      "One must know all the facts, he said in his thin voice.",
      "A man s strength has its limits, countess, and I have reached my limits.",
      "The whole day I have had to be making arrangements, arrangements about household matters arising (he emphasized the word _arising_) from my new, solitary position.",
      "The servants, the governess, the accounts....",
      "These pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart, and I have not the strength to bear it.",
      "At dinner ... yesterday, I was almost getting up from the dinner-table.",
      "I could not bear the way my son looked at me.",
      "He did not ask me the meaning of it all, but he wanted to ask, and I could not bear the look in his eyes.",
      "He was afraid to look at me, but that is not all.... Alexey Alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought him, but his voice shook, and he stopped.",
      "That bill on blue paper, for a hat and ribbons, he could not recall without a rush of self-pity.",
      "I understand, dear friend, said Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "I understand it all.",
      "Succor and comfort you will find not in me, though I have come only to aid you if I can.",
      "If I could take from off you all these petty, humiliating cares ...",
      "I understand that a woman s word, a woman s superintendence is needed.",
      "You will intrust it to me?",
      "Silently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand.",
      "Together we will take care of Seryozha.",
      "Practical affairs are not my strong point.",
      "But I will set to work.",
      "I will be your housekeeper.",
      "Don t thank me.",
      "I do it not from myself....",
      "I cannot help thanking you.",
      "But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you spoke being ashamed of what is the Christian s highest glory: _he who humbles himself shall be exalted_.",
      "And you cannot thank me.",
      "You must thank Him, and pray to Him for succor.",
      "In Him alone we find peace, consolation, salvation, and love, she said, and turning her eyes heavenwards, she began praying, as Alexey Alexandrovitch gathered from her silence.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now, and those expressions which had seemed to him, if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, now seemed to him natural and consolatory.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor.",
      "He was a believer, who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him.",
      "He had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine, and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried away by it, he had never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument.",
      "Now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.",
      "I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your words, he said, when she had finished praying.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend s hands.",
      "Now I will enter upon my duties, she said with a smile after a pause, as she wiped away the traces of tears.",
      "I am going to Seryozha.",
      "Only in the last extremity shall I apply to you.",
      "And she got up and went out.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha s part of the house, and dropping tears on the scared child s cheeks, she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise.",
      "She did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of Alexey Alexandrovitch s household.",
      "But she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point.",
      "All her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out, and they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch s valet, who, though no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin s household, and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing all it was necessary for him to know.",
      "But Lidia Ivanovna s help was none the less real; she gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him, and still more, as it was soothing to her to believe, in that she almost turned him to Christianity that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of late in Petersburg.",
      "It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and others who shared their views, was completely devoid of vividness of imagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions, and with actual fact.",
      "He saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing for unbelievers, did not exist for him, and that, as he was possessed of the most perfect faith, of the measure of which he was himself the judge, therefore there was no sin in his soul, and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth.",
      "It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he knew that when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power, he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness, he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that Christ was in his heart, and that in signing official papers he was doing His will.",
      "But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary, from which, looked down upon by all, he could look down on others, that he clung, as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation.",
      "Chapter 23 The Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and sentimental girl, been married to a wealthy man of high rank, an extremely good-natured, jovial, and extremely dissipated rake.",
      "Two months after marriage her husband abandoned her, and her impassioned protestations of affection he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count s good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental Lidia, were at a loss to explain.",
      "Though they were divorced and lived apart, yet whenever the husband met the wife, he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony, the cause of which was incomprehensible.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband, but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone.",
      "She was in love with several people at once, both men and women; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way.",
      "She was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family; she had been in love with a high dignitary of the Church, a vicar, and a parish priest; she had been in love with a journalist, three Slavophiles, with Komissarov, with a minister, a doctor, an English missionary and Karenin.",
      "All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent, did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society.",
      "But from the time that after Karenin s trouble she took him under her special protection, from the time that she set to work in Karenin s household looking after his welfare, she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing, and that she was now genuinely in love, and with no one but Karenin.",
      "The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings.",
      "Analyzing her feeling, and comparing it with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the Tsar, that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if there had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for himself, for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet to her high notes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his character, and his soft white hands with their swollen veins.",
      "She was not simply overjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him.",
      "She tried to please him, not by her words only, but in her whole person.",
      "For his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before.",
      "She caught herself in reveries on what might have been, if she had not been married and he had been free.",
      "She blushed with emotion when he came into the room, she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her.",
      "For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement.",
      "She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in Petersburg.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her, he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him, and that he might meet her any minute.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those _infamous people_, as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended doing, and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he could not come across them.",
      "The young adjutant, an acquaintance of Vronsky, through whom she obtained her information, and who hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, when the next morning a note was brought her, the handwriting of which she recognized with horror.",
      "It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina.",
      "The envelope was of paper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent.",
      "Who brought it?",
      "A commissionaire from the hotel.",
      "It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read the letter.",
      "Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma, to which she was subject.",
      "When she had recovered her composure, she read the following letter in French: Madame la Comtesse, The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the, I feel, unpardonable boldness to write to you.",
      "I am miserable at being separated from my son.",
      "I entreat permission to see him once before my departure.",
      "Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory.",
      "I apply to you and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply because I do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me.",
      "Knowing your friendship for him, I know you will understand me.",
      "Could you send Seryozha to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or will you let me know when and where I could see him away from home?",
      "I do not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests.",
      "You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him, and so cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.",
      "Anna.",
      "Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its contents and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially its free and easy as she considered tone.",
      "Say that there is no answer, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, and immediately opening her blotting-book, she wrote to Alexey Alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o clock at the levee.",
      "I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject.",
      "There we will arrange where to meet.",
      "Best of all at my house, where I will order tea _as you like it_.",
      "Urgent.",
      "He lays the cross, but He gives the strength to bear it, she added, so as to give him some slight preparation.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "She enjoyed that form of communication, which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews.",
      "Chapter 24 The levee was drawing to a close.",
      "People met as they were going away, and gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries.",
      "If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess Vatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief, said a gray-headed, little old man in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments.",
      "And me among the adjutants, said the maid of honor, smiling.",
      "You have an appointment already.",
      "You re over the ecclesiastical department.",
      "And your assistant s Karenin.",
      "Good-day, prince!",
      "said the little old man to a man who came up to him.",
      "What were you saying of Karenin?",
      "He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.",
      "I thought he had it already.",
      "Just look at him, said the little old man, pointing with his embroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the Imperial Council.",
      "Pleased and happy as a brass farthing, he added, stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions.",
      "No; he s looking older, said the gentleman of the bedchamber.",
      "From overwork.",
      "He s always drawing up projects nowadays.",
      "He won t let a poor devil go nowadays till he s explained it all to him under heads.",
      "Looking older, did you say?",
      "_Il fait des passions_.",
      "I believe Countess Lidia Ivanovna s jealous now of his wife.",
      "Oh, come now, please don t say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?",
      "But is it true Madame Karenina s here?",
      "Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg.",
      "I met her yesterday with Alexey Vronsky, _bras dessous, bras dessous_, in the Morsky.",
      "_C est un homme qui n a pas_,... the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning, but he stopped to make room, bowing, for a member of the Imperial family to pass.",
      "Thus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch, finding fault with him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the way of the member of the Imperial Council he had captured, was explaining to him point by point his new financial project, never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape.",
      "Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official the moment when his upward career comes to a full stop.",
      "This full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his career was over.",
      "Whether it was due to his feud with Stremov, or his misfortune with his wife, or simply that Alexey Alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits, it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end.",
      "He still filled a position of consequence, he sat on many commissions and committees, but he was a man whose day was over, and from whom nothing was expected.",
      "Whatever he said, whatever he proposed, was heard as though it were something long familiar, and the very thing that was not needed.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch was not aware of this, and, on the contrary, being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity, he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others, and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction.",
      "Shortly after his separation from his wife, he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure, the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety on this head, he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity.",
      "He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife, says the Apostle Paul, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, who was now guided in every action by Scripture, often recalled this text.",
      "It seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife, he had in these very projects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.",
      "The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get away from him did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he gave up his exposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his chance when one of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him.",
      "Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch looked down, collecting his thoughts, then looked casually about him and walked towards the door, where he hoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "And how strong they all are, how sound physically, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck of the prince, pinched by his tight uniform.",
      "He had to pass them on his way.",
      "Truly is it said that all the world is evil, he thought, with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber.",
      "Moving forward deliberately, Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him, and looking towards the door, his eyes sought Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "said the little old man, with a malicious light in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level with them, and was nodding with a frigid gesture, I haven t congratulated you yet, said the old man, pointing to his newly received ribbon.",
      "Thank you, answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "What an _exquisite_ day today, he added, laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word _exquisite_.",
      "That they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect anything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.",
      "Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out above her corset, and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her, Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went towards her.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna s dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all her dresses had done of late.",
      "Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she had pursued thirty years before.",
      "Then her desire had been to adorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better.",
      "Now, on the contrary, she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure, that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling.",
      "And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she succeeded, and was in his eyes attractive.",
      "For him she was the one island not only of goodwill to him, but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him.",
      "Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun.",
      "I congratulate you, she said to him, her eyes on his ribbon.",
      "Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, closing his eyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction, though he never admitted it.",
      "How is our angel?",
      "said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seryozha.",
      "I can t say I was quite pleased with him, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes.",
      "And Sitnikov is not satisfied with him.",
      "(Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seryozha s secular education had been intrusted.)",
      "As I have mentioned to you, there s a sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child.... Alexey Alexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him besides the service the education of his son.",
      "When Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna s help had been brought back anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands.",
      "Having never before taken any interest in educational questions, Alexey Alexandrovitch devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject.",
      "After reading several books on anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexey Alexandrovitch drew up a plan of education, and engaging the best tutor in Petersburg to superintend it, he set to work, and the subject continually absorbed him.",
      "Yes, but the heart.",
      "I see in him his father s heart, and with such a heart a child cannot go far wrong, said Lidia Ivanovna with enthusiasm.",
      "Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty.",
      "It s all I can do.",
      "You re coming to me, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause; we have to speak of a subject painful for you.",
      "I would give anything to have spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.",
      "I have received a letter from _her_.",
      "_She_ is here in Petersburg.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife, but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter.",
      "I was expecting it, he said.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes.",
      "Chapter 25 When Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna s snug little boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits, the lady herself had not yet made her appearance.",
      "She was changing her dress.",
      "A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service and a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room, and sitting down to the table, he opened a New Testament lying upon it.",
      "The rustle of the countess s silk skirt drew his attention off.",
      "Well now, we can sit quietly, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa, and talk over our tea.",
      "After some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing hard and flushing crimson, gave into Alexey Alexandrovitch s hands the letter she had received.",
      "After reading the letter, he sat a long while in silence.",
      "I don t think I have the right to refuse her, he said, timidly lifting his eyes.",
      "Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!",
      "On the contrary, I see that all is evil.",
      "But whether it is just.... His face showed irresolution, and a seeking for counsel, support, and guidance in a matter he did not understand.",
      "No, Countess Lidia Ivanovna interrupted him; there are limits to everything.",
      "I can understand immorality, she said, not quite truthfully, since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality; but I don t understand cruelty: to whom?",
      "to you!",
      "How can she stay in the town where you are?",
      "No, the longer one lives the more one learns.",
      "And I m learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness.",
      "Who is to throw a stone?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play.",
      "I have forgiven all, and so I cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her by her love for her son....",
      "But is that love, my friend?",
      "Is it sincere?",
      "Admitting that you have forgiven that you forgive have we the right to work on the feelings of that angel?",
      "He looks on her as dead.",
      "He prays for her, and beseeches God to have mercy on her sins.",
      "And it is better so.",
      "But now what will he think?",
      "I had not thought of that, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, evidently agreeing.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent.",
      "She was praying.",
      "If you ask my advice, she said, having finished her prayer and uncovered her face, I do not advise you to do this.",
      "Do you suppose I don t see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
      "But supposing that, as always, you don t think of yourself, what can it lead to?",
      "to fresh suffering for you, to torture for the child.",
      "If there were a trace of humanity left in her, she ought not to wish for it herself.",
      "No, I have no hesitation in saying I advise not, and if you will intrust it to me, I will write to her.",
      "And Alexey Alexandrovitch consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna sent the following letter in French: Dear Madame, To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in the child s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him sacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband s refusal in the spirit of Christian love.",
      "I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on you.",
      "Countess Lidia.",
      "This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna had concealed from herself.",
      "It wounded Anna to the quick.",
      "For his part, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on returning home from Lidia Ivanovna s, could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late.",
      "The thought of his wife, who had so greatly sinned against him, and towards whom he had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna had so justly told him, ought not to have troubled him; but he was not easy; he could not understand the book he was reading; he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her, of the mistake which, as it now seemed, he had made in regard to her.",
      "The memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of external decorum, and had not sent a challenge) tortured him like a remorse.",
      "He was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her; and most of all, his forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and his care of the other man s child made his heart burn with shame and remorse.",
      "And just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now, as he reviewed all his past with her, recalling the awkward words in which, after long wavering, he had made her an offer.",
      "But how have I been to blame?",
      "And this question always excited another question in him whether they felt differently, did their loving and marrying differently, these Vronskys and Oblonskys ... these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with their fine calves.",
      "And there passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome, vigorous, self-confident men, who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself.",
      "He tried to dispel these thoughts, he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life, but for the life of eternity, and that there was peace and love in his heart.",
      "But the fact that he had in this transient, trivial life made, as it seemed to him, a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence.",
      "But this temptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished once more in Alexey Alexandrovitch s soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember.",
      "Chapter 26 Well, Kapitonitch?",
      "said Seryozha, coming back rosy and good-humored from his walk the day before his birthday, and giving his overcoat to the tall old hall-porter, who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure.",
      "Well, has the bandaged clerk been here today?",
      "Did papa see him?",
      "He saw him.",
      "The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced him, said the hall-porter with a good-humored wink.",
      "Here, I ll take it off.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "said the tutor, stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms.",
      "Take it off yourself.",
      "But Seryozha, though he heard his tutor s feeble voice, did not pay attention to it.",
      "He stood keeping hold of the hall-porter s belt, and gazing into his face.",
      "Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?",
      "The hall-porter nodded his head affirmatively.",
      "The clerk with his face tied up, who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch, interested both Seryozha and the hall-porter.",
      "Seryozha had come upon him in the hall, and had heard him plaintively beg the hall-porter to announce him, saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face.",
      "Since then Seryozha, having met him a second time in the hall, took great interest in him.",
      "Well, was he very glad?",
      "Glad?",
      "I should think so!",
      "Almost dancing as he walked away.",
      "And has anything been left?",
      "asked Seryozha, after a pause.",
      "Come, sir, said the hall-porter; then with a shake of his head he whispered, Something from the countess.",
      "Seryozha understood at once that what the hall-porter was speaking of was a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday.",
      "What do you say?",
      "Korney took it to your papa.",
      "A fine plaything it must be too!",
      "How big?",
      "Like this?",
      "Rather small, but a fine thing.",
      "A book.",
      "No, a thing.",
      "Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling you, said the porter, hearing the tutor s steps approaching, and carefully taking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off, he signed with his head towards the tutor.",
      "Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!",
      "answered Seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily Lukitch.",
      "Seryozha was too happy, everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia Ivanovna s niece.",
      "This piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him.",
      "It seemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy.",
      "You know papa s received the Alexander Nevsky today?",
      "To be sure I do!",
      "People have been already to congratulate him.",
      "And is he glad?",
      "Glad at the Tsar s gracious favor!",
      "It s a proof he s deserved it, said the porter severely and seriously.",
      "Seryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which he had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha, who saw him only from below.",
      "Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?",
      "The porter s daughter was a ballet dancer.",
      "When is she to come on week-days?",
      "They ve their lessons to learn too.",
      "And you ve your lesson, sir; run along.",
      "On coming into the room, Seryozha, instead of sitting down to his lessons, told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a machine.",
      "But Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher, who was coming at two.",
      "No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch, he asked suddenly, when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands, what is greater than the Alexander Nevsky?",
      "You know papa s received the Alexander Nevsky?",
      "Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the Alexander Nevsky.",
      "And higher still?",
      "Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.",
      "And higher than the Andrey?",
      "What, you don t know?",
      "and Seryozha, leaning on his elbows, sank into deep meditation.",
      "His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character.",
      "He imagined his father s having suddenly been presented with both the Vladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson, and dreamed how, when he was grown up, he would himself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than the Andrey.",
      "Directly any higher order were invented, he would win it.",
      "They would make a higher one still, and he would immediately win that too.",
      "The time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt.",
      "This touched Seryozha.",
      "He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson; however much he tried, he was utterly unable to do that.",
      "As long as the teacher was explaining to him, he believed him and seemed to comprehend, but as soon as he was left alone, he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action.",
      "Still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher.",
      "He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.",
      "Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?",
      "he asked all, of a sudden.",
      "You d much better be thinking about your work.",
      "Birthdays are of no importance to a rational being.",
      "It s a day like any other on which one has to do one s work.",
      "Seryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his scanty beard, at his spectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose, and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him.",
      "He knew that the teacher did not think what he said; he felt it from the tone in which it was said.",
      "But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff?",
      "Why does he keep me off; why doesn t he love me?",
      "he asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer.",
      "Chapter 27 After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father s lesson.",
      "While waiting for his father, Seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife, and fell to dreaming.",
      "Among Seryozha s favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks.",
      "He did not believe in death generally, and in her death in particular, in spite of what Lidia Ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed, and it was just because of that, and after he had been told she was dead, that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk.",
      "Every woman of full, graceful figure with dark hair was his mother.",
      "At the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him, and tears came into his eyes.",
      "And he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him, would lift her veil.",
      "All her face would be visible, she would smile, she would hug him, he would sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and cry with happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered fingers.",
      "Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which he could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way.",
      "That day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he had watched with a throbbing heart, believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path.",
      "The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared somewhere.",
      "That day, more intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of love for her, and now, waiting for his father, he forgot everything, and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife, staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.",
      "Here is your papa!",
      "said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him.",
      "Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father, and kissing his hand, looked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the Alexander Nevsky.",
      "Did you have a nice walk?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sitting down in his easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him and opening it.",
      "Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history thoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson, and Seryozha observed this.",
      "Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa, said Seryozha, sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden.",
      "I saw Nadinka (Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna s who was being brought up in her house).",
      "She told me you d been given a new star.",
      "Are you glad, papa?",
      "First of all, don t rock your chair, please, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And secondly, it s not the reward that s precious, but the work itself.",
      "And I could have wished you understood that.",
      "If you now are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work will seem hard to you; but when you work (Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he spoke, thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers), loving your work, you will find your reward in it.",
      "Seryozha s eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness, grew dull and dropped before his father s gaze.",
      "This was the same long-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it.",
      "His father always talked to him so Seryozha felt as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly unlike himself.",
      "And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the story-book boy.",
      "You understand that, I hope?",
      "said his father.",
      "Yes, papa, answered Seryozha, acting the part of the imaginary boy.",
      "The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the Gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament.",
      "The verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding, bony knobbiness of his father s forehead, that he lost the thread, and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another.",
      "So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying, and that irritated him.",
      "He frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember, because he understood it too well, just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action.",
      "Seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father, and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said, as he sometimes did.",
      "And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now understood nothing.",
      "But his father did not make him repeat it, and passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament.",
      "Seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough, but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had already been punished over this lesson.",
      "The passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair, was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the Flood.",
      "He did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up alive to heaven.",
      "Last time he had remembered their names, but now he had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch s translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought, in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father s watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned button on his waistcoat.",
      "In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved entirely.",
      "He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all that he himself would die.",
      "That was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible.",
      "But he had been told that all men die; he had asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed it; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly.",
      "But Enoch had not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die.",
      "And why cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?",
      "thought Seryozha.",
      "Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they might die, but the good might all be like Enoch.",
      "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
      "Enoch, Enos But you have said that already.",
      "This is bad, Seryozha, very bad.",
      "If you don t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a Christian, said his father, getting up, whatever can interest you?",
      "I am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch (this was the most important of his teachers) is displeased with you....",
      "I shall have to punish you.",
      "His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly.",
      "But still it could not be said he was a stupid boy.",
      "On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha.",
      "In his father s opinion, he did not want to learn what he was taught.",
      "In reality he could not learn that.",
      "He could not, because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him.",
      "Those claims were in opposition, and he was in direct conflict with his education.",
      "He was nine years old; he was a child; but he knew his own soul, it was precious to him, he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he let no one into his soul.",
      "His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge.",
      "And he learned from Kapitonitch, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but not from his teachers.",
      "The spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its waters did their work in another channel.",
      "His father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka, Lidia Ivanovna s niece; but this punishment turned out happily for Seryozha.",
      "Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him how to make windmills.",
      "The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round.",
      "Of his mother Seryozha did not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly remembered her, and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him.",
      "Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things?",
      "That you might learn your lessons better?",
      "Toys?",
      "You ll never guess.",
      "A splendid thing; but it s a secret!",
      "When it comes to pass I ll tell you.",
      "Can t you guess!",
      "No, I can t guess.",
      "You tell me, said Vassily Lukitch with a smile, which was rare with him.",
      "Come, lie down, I m putting out the candle.",
      "Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for.",
      "I was almost telling the secret!",
      "said Seryozha, laughing gaily.",
      "When the candle was taken away, Seryozha heard and felt his mother.",
      "She stood over him, and with loving eyes caressed him.",
      "But then came windmills, a knife, everything began to be mixed up, and he fell asleep.",
      "Chapter 28 On arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best hotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her child, its nurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms.",
      "On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother s. There he found his mother, who had come from Moscow on business.",
      "His mother and sister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay abroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with Anna.",
      "His brother came the next morning to see Vronsky, and of his own accord asked him about her, and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a divorce, and then to marry her, and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife, and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so.",
      "If the world disapproves, I don t care, said Vronsky; but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have to be on the same terms with my wife.",
      "The elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger brother s judgment, could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question; for his part he had nothing against it, and with Alexey he went up to see Anna.",
      "Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they talked about Anna s going to Vronsky s estate.",
      "In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange misapprehension.",
      "One would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion.",
      "Of course, he thought, she would not be received at court, but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light.",
      "One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one s legs crossed in the same position, if one knows that there s nothing to prevent one s changing one s position; but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them.",
      "This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world.",
      "Though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them.",
      "But he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally, it was closed for Anna.",
      "Just as in the game of cat and mouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for Anna.",
      "One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his cousin Betsy.",
      "At last!",
      "she greeted him joyfully.",
      "And Anna?",
      "Where are you stopping?",
      "I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid.",
      "I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.",
      "How about the divorce?",
      "Is that all over?",
      "Vronsky noticed that Betsy s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place.",
      "People will throw stones at me, I know, she said, but I shall come and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come.",
      "You won t be here long, I suppose?",
      "And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her tone was not at all the same as in former days.",
      "She unmistakably prided herself on her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship.",
      "She only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and on leaving she said: You ve never told me when the divorce is to be?",
      "Supposing I m ready to fling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you re married.",
      "And that s so simple nowadays.",
      "_ a se fait_.",
      "So you re going on Friday?",
      "Sorry we shan t see each other again.",
      "From Betsy s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world; but he made another effort in his own family.",
      "His mother he did not reckon upon.",
      "He knew that his mother, who had been so enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son s career.",
      "But he had more hope of Varya, his brother s wife.",
      "He fancied she would not throw stones, and would go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive her in her own house.",
      "The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her alone, expressed his wishes directly.",
      "You know, Alexey, she said after hearing him, how fond I am of you, and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken, because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna, she said, articulating the name Anna Arkadyevna with particular care.",
      "Don t suppose, please, that I judge her.",
      "Never; perhaps in her place I should have done the same.",
      "I don t and can t enter into that, she said, glancing timidly at his gloomy face.",
      "But one must call things by their names.",
      "You want me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to rehabilitate her in society; but do understand that _I cannot_ do so.",
      "I have daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my husband s sake.",
      "Well, I m ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she will understand that I can t ask her here, or I should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently; that would offend her.",
      "I can t raise her.... Oh, I don t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive!",
      "Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily, and he got up in silence, understanding that his sister-in-law s decision was not to be shaken.",
      "Alexey!",
      "don t be angry with me.",
      "Please understand that I m not to blame, began Varya, looking at him with a timid smile.",
      "I m not angry with you, he said still as gloomily; but I m sorry in two ways.",
      "I m sorry, too, that this means breaking up our friendship if not breaking up, at least weakening it.",
      "You will understand that for me, too, it cannot be otherwise.",
      "And with that he left her.",
      "Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him.",
      "One of the most unpleasant features of his position in Petersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere.",
      "He could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him.",
      "So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually, as though on purpose, grazing his sore finger on everything.",
      "Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in Anna.",
      "At one time she would seem in love with him, and then she would become cold, irritable, and impenetrable.",
      "She was worrying over something, and keeping something back from him, and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence, and for her, with her delicate intuition, must have been still more unbearable.",
      "Chapter 29 One of Anna s objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her son.",
      "From the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her.",
      "And as she got nearer to Petersburg, the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination.",
      "She did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it.",
      "It seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him.",
      "But on her arrival in Petersburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society, and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.",
      "She had now been two days in Petersburg.",
      "The thought of her son never left her for a single instant, but she had not yet seen him.",
      "To go straight to the house, where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that she felt she had no right to do.",
      "She might be refused admittance and insulted.",
      "To write and so enter into relations with her husband that it made her miserable to think of doing; she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband.",
      "To get a glimpse of her son out walking, finding out where and when he went out, was not enough for her; she had so looked forward to this meeting, she had so much she must say to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him.",
      "Seryozha s old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do.",
      "But the nurse was not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch s house.",
      "In this uncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days had slipped by.",
      "Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter, which cost her great pains, and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband s generosity.",
      "She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband, he would keep up his character of magnanimity, and would not refuse her request.",
      "The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer, that there was no answer.",
      "She had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending for the commissionaire, she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited, and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer.",
      "Anna felt humiliated, insulted, but she saw that from her point of view Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right.",
      "Her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in solitude.",
      "She could not and would not share it with Vronsky.",
      "She knew that to him, although he was the primary cause of her distress, the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence.",
      "She knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering, that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him.",
      "And she dreaded that more than anything in the world, and so she hid from him everything that related to her son.",
      "Spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son, and had reached a decision to write to her husband.",
      "She was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "The countess s silence had subdued and depressed her, but the letter, all that she read between the lines in it, so exasperated her, this malice was so revolting beside her passionate, legitimate tenderness for her son, that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself.",
      "This coldness this pretense of feeling!",
      "They must needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to submit to it!",
      "Not on any consideration!",
      "She is worse than I am.",
      "I don t lie, anyway.",
      "And she decided on the spot that next day, Seryozha s birthday, she would go straight to her husband s house, bribe or deceive the servants, but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child.",
      "She went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought over a plan of action.",
      "She would go early in the morning at eight o clock, when Alexey Alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up.",
      "She would have money in her hand to give the hall-porter and the footman, so that they should let her in, and not raising her veil, she would say that she had come from Seryozha s godfather to congratulate him, and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside.",
      "She had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son.",
      "Often as she had dreamed of it, she could never think of anything.",
      "The next day, at eight o clock in the morning, Anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home.",
      "Run and see what s wanted.",
      "Some lady, said Kapitonitch, who, not yet dressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door.",
      "His assistant, a lad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in, and pulling a three-rouble note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand.",
      "Seryozha Sergey Alexeitch, she said, and was going on.",
      "Scrutinizing the note, the porter s assistant stopped her at the second glass door.",
      "She did not hear his words and made no answer.",
      "Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonitch went out to her, opened the second door for her, and asked her what she was pleased to want.",
      "From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch, she said.",
      "His honor s not up yet, said the porter, looking at her attentively.",
      "Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her.",
      "Memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart, and for a moment she forgot what she was here for.",
      "Would you kindly wait?",
      "said Kapitonitch, taking off her fur cloak.",
      "As he took off the cloak, Kapitonitch glanced at her face, recognized her, and made her a low bow in silence.",
      "Please walk in, your excellency, he said to her.",
      "She tried to say something, but her voice refused to utter any sound; with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light, swift steps up the stairs.",
      "Bent double, and his galoshes catching in the steps, Kapitonitch ran after her, trying to overtake her.",
      "The tutor s there; maybe he s not dressed.",
      "I ll let him know.",
      "Anna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding what the old man was saying.",
      "This way, to the left, if you please.",
      "Excuse its not being tidy.",
      "His honor s in the old parlor now, the hall-porter said, panting.",
      "Excuse me, wait a little, your excellency; I ll just see, he said, and overtaking her, he opened the high door and disappeared behind it.",
      "Anna stood still waiting.",
      "He s only just awake, said the hall-porter, coming out.",
      "And at the very instant the porter said this, Anna caught the sound of a childish yawn.",
      "From the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes.",
      "Let me in; go away!",
      "she said, and went in through the high doorway.",
      "On the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed was the boy.",
      "His little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned, he was stretching and still yawning.",
      "The instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again.",
      "she whispered, going noiselessly up to him.",
      "When she was parted from him, and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured him as he was at four years old, when she had loved him most of all.",
      "Now he was not even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from the four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner.",
      "How thin his face was, how short his hair was!",
      "What long hands!",
      "How he had changed since she left him!",
      "But it was he with his head, his lips, his soft neck and broad little shoulders.",
      "she repeated just in the child s ear.",
      "He raised himself again on his elbow, turned his tangled head from side to side as though looking for something, and opened his eyes.",
      "Slowly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him, then all at once he smiled a blissful smile, and shutting his eyes, rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms.",
      "my darling boy!",
      "she said, breathing hard and putting her arms round his plump little body.",
      "he said, wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him.",
      "Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes, he flung fat little arms round her shoulders, rolled towards her, with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children, and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders.",
      "I know, he said, opening his eyes; it s my birthday today.",
      "I knew you d come.",
      "I ll get up directly.",
      "And saying that he dropped asleep.",
      "Anna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence.",
      "She knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long now, that were thrust out below the quilt, those short-cropped curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him.",
      "She touched all this and could say nothing; tears choked her.",
      "What are you crying for, mother?",
      "he said, waking completely up.",
      "Mother, what are you crying for?",
      "he cried in a tearful voice.",
      "I won t cry ...",
      "I m crying for joy.",
      "It s so long since I ve seen you.",
      "I won t, I won t, she said, gulping down her tears and turning away.",
      "Come, it s time for you to dress now, she added, after a pause, and, never letting go his hands, she sat down by his bedside on the chair, where his clothes were put ready for him.",
      "How do you dress without me?",
      "How.... she tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully, but she could not, and again she turned away.",
      "I don t have a cold bath, papa didn t order it.",
      "And you ve not seen Vassily Lukitch?",
      "He ll come in soon.",
      "Why, you re sitting on my clothes!",
      "And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter.",
      "She looked at him and smiled.",
      "Mother, darling, sweet one!",
      "he shouted, flinging himself on her again and hugging her.",
      "It was as though only now, on seeing her smile, he fully grasped what had happened.",
      "I don t want that on, he said, taking off her hat.",
      "And as it were, seeing her afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing her again.",
      "But what did you think about me?",
      "You didn t think I was dead?",
      "I never believed it.",
      "You didn t believe it, my sweet?",
      "I knew, I knew!",
      "he repeated his favorite phrase, and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair, he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it.",
      "Chapter 30 Meanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was, and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband, and whom he had not seen, as he had entered the house after her departure.",
      "He was in doubt whether to go in or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Reflecting finally that his duty was to get Seryozha up at the hour fixed, and that it was therefore not his business to consider who was there, the mother or anyone else, but simply to do his duty, he finished dressing, went to the door and opened it.",
      "But the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices, and what they were saying, made him change his mind.",
      "He shook his head, and with a sigh he closed the door.",
      "I ll wait another ten minutes, he said to himself, clearing his throat and wiping away tears.",
      "Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time.",
      "All had heard that their mistress had come, and that Kapitonitch had let her in, and that she was even now in the nursery, and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o clock, and everyone fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet, and that they must prevent it.",
      "Korney, the valet, going down to the hall-porter s room, asked who had let her in, and how it was he had done so, and ascertaining that Kapitonitch had admitted her and shown her up, he gave the old man a talking-to.",
      "The hall-porter was doggedly silent, but when Korney told him he ought to be sent away, Kapitonitch darted up to him, and waving his hands in Korney s face, began: Oh yes, to be sure you d not have let her in!",
      "After ten years service, and never a word but of kindness, and there you d up and say, Be off, go along, get away with you!",
      "Oh yes, you re a shrewd one at politics, I dare say!",
      "You don t need to be taught how to swindle the master, and to filch fur coats!",
      "Soldier!",
      "said Korney contemptuously, and he turned to the nurse who was coming in.",
      "Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna: he let her in without a word to anyone, Korney said addressing her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch will be down immediately and go into the nursery!",
      "A pretty business, a pretty business!",
      "said the nurse.",
      "You, Korney Vassilievitch, you d best keep him some way or other, the master, while I ll run and get her away somehow.",
      "A pretty business!",
      "When the nurse went into the nursery, Seryozha was telling his mother how he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill, and had turned over three times.",
      "She was listening to the sound of his voice, watching his face and the play of expression on it, touching his hand, but she did not follow what he was saying.",
      "She must go, she must leave him, this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling.",
      "She heard the steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing; she heard, too, the steps of the nurse as she came near; but she sat like one turned to stone, incapable of beginning to speak or to get up.",
      "Mistress, darling!",
      "began the nurse, going up to Anna and kissing her hands and shoulders.",
      "God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his birthday.",
      "You aren t changed one bit.",
      "Oh, nurse dear, I didn t know you were in the house, said Anna, rousing herself for a moment.",
      "I m not living here, I m living with my daughter.",
      "I came for the birthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!",
      "The nurse suddenly burst into tears, and began kissing her hand again.",
      "Seryozha, with radiant eyes and smiles, holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other, pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet.",
      "The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy.",
      "She often comes to see me, and when she comes.... he was beginning, but he stopped, noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother, and that in his mother s face there was a look of dread and something like shame, which was so strangely unbecoming to her.",
      "She went up to him.",
      "My sweet!",
      "She could not say _good-bye_, but the expression on her face said it, and he understood.",
      "Darling, darling Kootik!",
      "she used the name by which she had called him when he was little, you won t forget me?",
      "You.... but she could not say more.",
      "How often afterwards she thought of words she might have said.",
      "But now she did not know how to say it, and could say nothing.",
      "But Seryozha knew all she wanted to say to him.",
      "He understood that she was unhappy and loved him.",
      "He understood even what the nurse had whispered.",
      "He had caught the words always at nine o clock, and he knew that this was said of his father, and that his father and mother could not meet.",
      "That he understood, but one thing he could not understand why there should be a look of dread and shame in her face?...",
      "She was not in fault, but she was afraid of him and ashamed of something.",
      "He would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt, but he did not dare; he saw that she was miserable, and he felt for her.",
      "Silently he pressed close to her and whispered, Don t go yet.",
      "He won t come just yet.",
      "The mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking, what to say to him, and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father, but, as it were, asking her what he ought to think about his father.",
      "Seryozha, my darling, she said, love him; he s better and kinder than I am, and I have done him wrong.",
      "When you grow up you will judge.",
      "There s no one better than you!...",
      "he cried in despair through his tears, and, clutching her by the shoulders, he began squeezing her with all his force to him, his arms trembling with the strain.",
      "My sweet, my little one!",
      "said Anna, and she cried as weakly and childishly as he.",
      "At that moment the door opened.",
      "Vassily Lukitch came in.",
      "At the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a scared whisper said, He s coming, and gave Anna her hat.",
      "Seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his face in his hands.",
      "Anna removed his hands, once more kissed his wet face, and with rapid steps went to the door.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in, meeting her.",
      "Seeing her, he stopped short and bowed his head.",
      "Although she had just said he was better and kinder than she, in the rapid glance she flung at him, taking in his whole figure in all its details, feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her son took possession of her.",
      "With a swift gesture she put down her veil, and, quickening her pace, almost ran out of the room.",
      "She had not time to undo, and so carried back with her, the parcel of toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow.",
      "Chapter 31 As intensely as Anna had longed to see her son, and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it, she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply.",
      "On getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there.",
      "Yes, it s all over, and I am again alone, she said to herself, and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth.",
      "Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows, she tried to think.",
      "The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress.",
      "She gazed at her wonderingly and said, Presently.",
      "A footman offered her coffee.",
      "Later on, she said.",
      "The Italian nurse, after having taken the baby out in her best, came in with her, and brought her to Anna.",
      "The plump, well-fed little baby, on seeing her mother, as she always did, held out her fat little hands, and with a smile on her toothless mouth, began, like a fish with a float, bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered skirt, making them rustle.",
      "It was impossible not to smile, not to kiss the baby, impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch, crowing and prancing all over; impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss.",
      "And all this Anna did, and took her in her arms and made her dance, and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows; but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for Seryozha.",
      "Everything in this baby was charming, but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart.",
      "On her first child, though the child of an unloved father, had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction.",
      "Her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child.",
      "Besides, in the little girl everything was still in the future, while Seryozha was by now almost a personality, and a personality dearly loved.",
      "In him there was a conflict of thought and feeling; he understood her, he loved her, he judged her, she thought, recalling his words and his eyes.",
      "And she was forever not physically only but spiritually divided from him, and it was impossible to set this right.",
      "She gave the baby back to the nurse, let her go, and opened the locket in which there was Seryozha s portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl.",
      "She got up, and, taking off her hat, took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages.",
      "She wanted to compare them, and began taking them out of the album.",
      "She took them all out except one, the latest and best photograph.",
      "In it he was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair, with frowning eyes and smiling lips.",
      "It was his best, most characteristic expression.",
      "With her little supple hands, her white, delicate fingers, that moved with a peculiar intensity today, she pulled at a corner of the photograph, but the photograph had caught somewhere, and she could not get it out.",
      "There was no paper-knife on the table, and so, pulling out the photograph that was next to her son s (it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and with long hair), she used it to push out her son s photograph.",
      "Oh, here is he!",
      "she said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery.",
      "She had not once thought of him all the morning.",
      "But now, coming all at once upon that manly, noble face, so familiar and so dear to her, she felt a sudden rush of love for him.",
      "But where is he?",
      "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
      "she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach, forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son.",
      "She sent to ask him to come to her immediately; with a throbbing heart she awaited him, rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all, and the expressions of love with which he would console her.",
      "The messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him, but that he would come immediately, and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in Petersburg.",
      "He s not coming alone, and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me, she thought; he s not coming so that I could tell him everything, but coming with Yashvin.",
      "And all at once a strange idea came to her: what if he had ceased to love her?",
      "And going over the events of the last few days, it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea.",
      "The fact that he had not dined at home yesterday, and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg, and that even now he was not coming to her alone, as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face.",
      "But he ought to tell me so.",
      "I must know that it is so.",
      "If I knew it, then I know what I should do, she said to herself, utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her.",
      "She thought he had ceased to love her, she felt close upon despair, and consequently she felt exceptionally alert.",
      "She rang for her maid and went to her dressing-room.",
      "As she dressed, she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those days, as though he might, if he had grown cold to her, fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her.",
      "She heard the bell ring before she was ready.",
      "When she went into the drawing-room it was not he, but Yashvin, who met her eyes.",
      "Vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son, which she had forgotten on the table, and he made no haste to look round at her.",
      "We have met already, she said, putting her little hand into the huge hand of Yashvin, whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face.",
      "We met last year at the races.",
      "Give them to me, she said, with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the photographs of her son, and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes.",
      "Were the races good this year?",
      "Instead of them I saw the races in the Corso in Rome.",
      "But you don t care for life abroad, she said with a cordial smile.",
      "I know you and all your tastes, though I have seen so little of you.",
      "I m awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly bad, said Yashvin, gnawing at his left mustache.",
      "Having talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the clock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in Petersburg, and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap.",
      "Not long, I think, she said hesitatingly, glancing at Vronsky.",
      "So then we shan t meet again?",
      "Come and dine with me, said Anna resolutely, angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment, but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person.",
      "The dinner here is not good, but at least you will see him.",
      "There is no one of his old friends in the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for you.",
      "Delighted, said Yashvin with a smile, from which Vronsky could see that he liked Anna very much.",
      "Yashvin said good-bye and went away; Vronsky stayed behind.",
      "Are you going too?",
      "I m late already, he answered.",
      "Run along!",
      "I ll catch you up in a moment, he called to Yashvin.",
      "She took him by the hand, and without taking her eyes off him, gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him.",
      "Wait a minute, there s something I want to say to you, and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck.",
      "Oh, was it right my asking him to dinner?",
      "You did quite right, he said with a serene smile that showed his even teeth, and he kissed her hand.",
      "Alexey, you have not changed to me?",
      "she said, pressing his hand in both of hers.",
      "Alexey, I am miserable here.",
      "When are we going away?",
      "You wouldn t believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too, he said, and he drew away his hand.",
      "Well, go, go!",
      "she said in a tone of offense, and she walked quickly away from him.",
      "Chapter 32 When Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home.",
      "Soon after he had left, some lady, so they told him, had come to see her, and she had gone out with her.",
      "That she had gone out without leaving word where she was going, that she had not yet come back, and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him all this, together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning, and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before Yashvin almost snatched her son s photographs out of his hands, made him serious.",
      "He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her.",
      "And he waited for her in her drawing-room.",
      "But Anna did not return alone, but brought with her her old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.",
      "This was the lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had gone out shopping.",
      "Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky s worried and inquiring expression, and began a lively account of her morning s shopping.",
      "He saw that there was something working within her; in her flashing eyes, when they rested for a moment on him, there was an intense concentration, and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which, during the early period of their intimacy, had so fascinated him, but which now so disturbed and alarmed him.",
      "The dinner was laid for four.",
      "All were gathered together and about to go into the little dining-room when Tushkevitch made his appearance with a message from Princess Betsy.",
      "Princess Betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed, but begged Anna to come to her between half-past six and nine o clock.",
      "Vronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time, so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared not to notice it.",
      "Very sorry that I can t come just between half-past six and nine, she said with a faint smile.",
      "The princess will be very sorry.",
      "You re going, no doubt, to hear Patti?",
      "said Tushkevitch.",
      "Patti?",
      "You suggest the idea to me.",
      "I would go if it were possible to get a box.",
      "I can get one, Tushkevitch offered his services.",
      "I should be very, very grateful to you, said Anna.",
      "But won t you dine with us?",
      "Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug.",
      "He was at a complete loss to understand what Anna was about.",
      "What had she brought the old Princess Oblonskaya home for, what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for, and, most amazing of all, why was she sending him for a box?",
      "Could she possibly think in her position of going to Patti s benefit, where all the circle of her acquaintances would be?",
      "He looked at her with serious eyes, but she responded with that defiant, half-mirthful, half-desperate look, the meaning of which he could not comprehend.",
      "At dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits she almost flirted both with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin.",
      "When they got up from dinner and Tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera, Yashvin went to smoke, and Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms.",
      "After sitting there for some time he ran upstairs.",
      "Anna was already dressed in a low-necked gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, and with costly white lace on her head, framing her face, and particularly becoming, showing up her dazzling beauty.",
      "Are you really going to the theater?",
      "he said, trying not to look at her.",
      "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
      "she said, wounded again at his not looking at her.",
      "She appeared not to understand the motive of his words.",
      "Oh, of course, there s no reason whatever, he said, frowning.",
      "That s just what I say, she said, willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone, and quietly turning back her long, perfumed glove.",
      "Anna, for God s sake!",
      "what is the matter with you?",
      "he said, appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done.",
      "I don t understand what you are asking.",
      "You know that it s out of the question to go.",
      "I m not going alone.",
      "Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she is going with me.",
      "He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.",
      "But do you mean to say you don t know?...",
      "But I don t care to know!",
      "she almost shrieked.",
      "I don t care to.",
      "Do I regret what I have done?",
      "No, no, no!",
      "If it were all to do again from the beginning, it would be the same.",
      "For us, for you and for me, there is only one thing that matters, whether we love each other.",
      "Other people we need not consider.",
      "Why are we living here apart and not seeing each other?",
      "Why can t I go?",
      "I love you, and I don t care for anything, she said in Russian, glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not understand.",
      "If you have not changed to me, why don t you look at me?",
      "He looked at her.",
      "He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress, always so becoming to her.",
      "But now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him.",
      "My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat you, he said again in French, with a note of tender supplication in his voice, but with coldness in his eyes.",
      "She did not hear his words, but she saw the coldness of his eyes, and answered with irritation: And I beg you to explain why I should not go.",
      "Because it might cause you.... he hesitated.",
      "Yashvin _n est pas compromettant_, and Princess Varvara is no worse than others.",
      "Oh, here she is!",
      "Chapter 33 Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna, almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position.",
      "This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger.",
      "If he had told her directly what he was thinking, he would have said: In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to society, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.",
      "He could not say that to her.",
      "But how can she fail to see it, and what is going on in her?",
      "He felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified.",
      "He went back scowling to his rooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin, who, with his long legs stretched out on a chair, was drinking brandy and seltzer water, he ordered a glass of the same for himself.",
      "You were talking of Lankovsky s Powerful.",
      "That s a fine horse, and I would advise you to buy him, said Yashvin, glancing at his comrade s gloomy face.",
      "His hind-quarters aren t quite first-rate, but the legs and head one couldn t wish for anything better.",
      "I think I will take him, answered Vronsky.",
      "Their conversation about horses interested him, but he did not for an instant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater.",
      "Yashvin, tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water, drank it and got up, buttoning his coat.",
      "Well, let s go, he said, faintly smiling under his mustache, and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of Vronsky s gloominess, and did not attach any significance to it.",
      "I m not going, Vronsky answered gloomily.",
      "Well, I must, I promised to.",
      "Good-bye, then.",
      "If you do, come to the stalls; you can take Kruzin s stall, added Yashvin as he went out.",
      "No, I m busy.",
      "A wife is a care, but it s worse when she s not a wife, thought Yashvin, as he walked out of the hotel.",
      "Vronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room.",
      "And what s today?",
      "The fourth night.... Yegor and his wife are there, and my mother, most likely.",
      "Of course all Petersburg s there.",
      "Now she s gone in, taken off her cloak and come into the light.",
      "Tushkevitch, Yashvin, Princess Varvara, he pictured them to himself.... What about me?",
      "Either that I m frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the right to protect her?",
      "From every point of view stupid, stupid!...",
      "And why is she putting me in such a position?",
      "he said with a gesture of despair.",
      "With that gesture he knocked against the table, on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy, and almost upset it.",
      "He tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily kicked the table over and rang.",
      "If you care to be in my service, he said to the valet who came in, you had better remember your duties.",
      "This shouldn t be here.",
      "You ought to have cleared away.",
      "The valet, conscious of his own innocence, would have defended himself, but glancing at his master, he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent, and hurriedly threading his way in and out, dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles.",
      "That s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress coat out.",
      "Vronsky went into the theater at half-past eight.",
      "The performance was in full swing.",
      "The little old box-keeper, recognizing Vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat, called him Your Excellency, and suggested he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor.",
      "In the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.",
      "Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet _staccato_ accompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase.",
      "The door opened to let the box-opener slip through, and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky s hearing clearly.",
      "But the doors were closed again at once, and Vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over.",
      "When he entered the hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise was still going on.",
      "On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was, with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm, gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights.",
      "Then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her, and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement, craning forward, shouting and clapping.",
      "The conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering, and straightened his white tie.",
      "Vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about him.",
      "That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar, habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the familiar, uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater.",
      "There were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed women God knows who and uniforms and black coats; the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery; and among the crowd, in the boxes and in the front rows, were some forty of the _real_ people.",
      "And to those oases Vronsky at once directed his attention, and with them he entered at once into relation.",
      "The act was over when he went in, and so he did not go straight to his brother s box, but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with Serpuhovskoy, who, standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights, caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him, smiling.",
      "Vronsky had not yet seen Anna.",
      "He purposely avoided looking in her direction.",
      "But he knew by the direction of people s eyes where she was.",
      "He looked round discreetly, but he was not seeking her; expecting the worst, his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "To his relief Alexey Alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.",
      "How little of the military man there is left in you!",
      "Serpuhovskoy was saying to him.",
      "A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one would say.",
      "Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat, answered Vronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his opera-glass.",
      "Well, I ll own I envy you there.",
      "When I come back from abroad and put on this, he touched his epaulets, I regret my freedom.",
      "Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky s career, but he liked him as before, and was now particularly cordial to him.",
      "What a pity you were not in time for the first act!",
      "Vronsky, listening with one ear, moved his opera-glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes.",
      "Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera-glass, Vronsky suddenly caught sight of Anna s head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and smiling in the frame of lace.",
      "She was in the fifth box, twenty paces from him.",
      "She was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to Yashvin.",
      "The setting of her head on her handsome, broad shoulders, and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow.",
      "But he felt utterly different towards her beauty now.",
      "In his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty, though it attracted him even more intensely than before, gave him now a sense of injury.",
      "She was not looking in his direction, but Vronsky felt that she had seen him already.",
      "When Vronsky turned the opera-glass again in that direction, he noticed that Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box.",
      "Anna, folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and obviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.",
      "Yashvin s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards.",
      "Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box.",
      "In that box on the left were the Kartasovs.",
      "Vronsky knew them, and knew that Anna was acquainted with them.",
      "Madame Kartasova, a thin little woman, was standing up in her box, and, her back turned upon Anna, she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her.",
      "Her face was pale and angry, and she was talking excitedly.",
      "Kartasov, a fat, bald man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he attempted to soothe his wife.",
      "When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a long while, and tried to catch Anna s eye, obviously anxious to bow to her.",
      "But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and talked to Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her.",
      "Kartasov went out without making his salutation, and the box was left empty.",
      "Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the Kartasovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had happened.",
      "He knew this both from what he had seen, and most of all from the face of Anna, who, he could see, was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up.",
      "And in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful.",
      "Anyone who did not know her and her circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she should show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks.",
      "Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what, Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out something, he went towards his brother s box.",
      "Purposely choosing the way round furthest from Anna s box, he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances.",
      "Vronsky heard the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel hastened to address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his companions.",
      "Ah, Vronsky!",
      "When are you coming to the regiment?",
      "We can t let you off without a supper.",
      "You re one of the old set, said the colonel of his regiment.",
      "I can t stop, awfully sorry, another time, said Vronsky, and he ran upstairs towards his brother s box.",
      "The old countess, Vronsky s mother, with her steel-gray curls, was in his brother s box.",
      "Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in the corridor.",
      "Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varya held out her hand to her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what interested him.",
      "She was more excited than he had ever seen her.",
      "I think it s mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no right to do it.",
      "Madame Karenina.... she began.",
      "But what is it?",
      "you ve not heard?",
      "You know I should be the last person to hear of it.",
      "There isn t a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!",
      "But what did she do?",
      "My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina.",
      "Her husband began talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.",
      "She said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went away.",
      "Count, your maman is asking for you, said the young Princess Sorokina, peeping out of the door of the box.",
      "I ve been expecting you all the while, said his mother, smiling sarcastically.",
      "You were nowhere to be seen.",
      "Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.",
      "Good evening, maman.",
      "I have come to you, he said coldly.",
      "Why aren t you going to _faire la cour Madame Karenina?_ she went on, when Princess Sorokina had moved away.",
      "_Elle fait sensation.",
      "On oublie la Patti pour elle_.",
      "Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that, he answered, scowling.",
      "I m only saying what everyone s saying.",
      "Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he went away.",
      "At the door he met his brother.",
      "Ah, Alexey!",
      "said his brother.",
      "How disgusting!",
      "Idiot of a woman, nothing else....",
      "I wanted to go straight to her.",
      "Let s go together.",
      "Vronsky did not hear him.",
      "With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt that he must do something, but he did not know what.",
      "Anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position, together with pity for her suffering, filled his heart.",
      "He went down, and made straight for Anna s box.",
      "At her box stood Stremov, talking to her.",
      "There are no more tenors.",
      "_Le moule en est bris !_ Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov.",
      "You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song, Anna said to Vronsky, glancing ironically, he thought, at him.",
      "I am a poor judge of music, he said, looking sternly at her.",
      "Like Prince Yashvin, she said smiling, who considers that Patti sings too loud.",
      "Thank you, she said, her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered.",
      "She got up and went into the interior of the box.",
      "Noticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing indignant hushes in the silent audience, went out in the middle of a solo and drove home.",
      "Anna was already at home.",
      "When Vronsky went up to her, she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater.",
      "She was sitting in the first armchair against the wall, looking straight before her.",
      "She looked at him, and at once resumed her former position.",
      "Anna, he said.",
      "You, you are to blame for everything!",
      "she cried, with tears of despair and hatred in her voice, getting up.",
      "I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be unpleasant....",
      "Unpleasant!",
      "she cried hideous!",
      "As long as I live I shall never forget it.",
      "She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.",
      "A silly woman s chatter, he said: but why risk it, why provoke?...",
      "I hate your calm.",
      "You ought not to have brought me to this.",
      "If you had loved me.... Anna!",
      "How does the question of my love come in?",
      "Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am!...",
      "she said, looking at him with an expression of terror.",
      "He was sorry for her, and angry notwithstanding.",
      "He assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her, and he did not reproach her in words, but in his heart he reproached her.",
      "And the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so vulgar that he was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually became calmer.",
      "The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the country.",
      "PART SIX Chapter 1 Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at her sister Kitty Levin s. The house on her own estate was quite in ruins, and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement.",
      "He said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family, which would have been the greatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow, he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two.",
      "Besides the Oblonskys, with all their children and their governess, the old princess too came to stay that summer with the Levins, as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.",
      "Moreover, Varenka, Kitty s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to Kitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend.",
      "All of these were friends or relations of Levin s wife.",
      "And though he liked them all, he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways, which was smothered by this influx of the Shtcherbatsky element, as he called it to himself.",
      "Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey Ivanovitch, but he too was a man of the Koznishev and not the Levin stamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.",
      "In the Levins house, so long deserted, there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it happened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all over, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table.",
      "And Kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble to get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.",
      "The whole family were sitting at dinner.",
      "Dolly s children, with their governess and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for mushrooms.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe, surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.",
      "Take me with you.",
      "I am very fond of picking mushrooms, he said, looking at Varenka; I think it s a very nice occupation.",
      "Oh, we shall be delighted, answered Varenka, coloring a little.",
      "Kitty exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly.",
      "The proposal of the learned and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty s with which her mind had been very busy of late.",
      "She made haste to address some remark to her mother, so that her look should not be noticed.",
      "After dinner Sergey Ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom-picking expedition.",
      "Levin was sitting in the window near his brother.",
      "Kitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him something.",
      "You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the better, said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and obviously little interested in the conversation, but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories.",
      "Katya, it s not good for you to stand, her husband said to her, putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.",
      "Oh, and there s no time either, added Sergey Ivanovitch, seeing the children running out.",
      "At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn stockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch s hat, she ran straight up to him.",
      "Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her father s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.",
      "Varenka s waiting, she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing from Sergey Ivanovitch s smile that she might do so.",
      "Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a white kerchief on her head.",
      "I m coming, I m coming, Varvara Andreevna, said Sergey Ivanovitch, finishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar-case.",
      "And how sweet my Varenka is!",
      "said Kitty to her husband, as soon as Sergey Ivanovitch rose.",
      "She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could hear, and it was clear that she meant him to do so.",
      "And how good-looking she is such a refined beauty!",
      "Varenka!",
      "Kitty shouted.",
      "Shall you be in the mill copse?",
      "We ll come out to you.",
      "You certainly forget your condition, Kitty, said the old princess, hurriedly coming out at the door.",
      "You mustn t shout like that.",
      "Varenka, hearing Kitty s voice and her mother s reprimand, went with light, rapid steps up to Kitty.",
      "The rapidity of her movement, her flushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her.",
      "Kitty knew what this was, and had been watching her intently.",
      "She called Varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as Kitty fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood.",
      "Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to happen, she whispered as she kissed her.",
      "And are you coming with us?",
      "Varenka said to Levin in confusion, pretending not to have heard what had been said.",
      "I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall stop.",
      "Why, what do you want there?",
      "I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice, said Levin; and where will you be?",
      "On the terrace.",
      "Chapter 2 On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party.",
      "They always liked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do there too.",
      "Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which all of them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water.",
      "Kitty had introduced this new method, which had been in use in her home.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been intrusted, considering that what had been done in the Levin household could not be amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries, maintaining that the jam could not be made without it.",
      "She had been caught in the act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, and her thin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the charcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly.",
      "The princess, conscious that Agafea Mihalovna s wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as the person responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other matters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.",
      "I always buy my maids dresses myself, of some cheap material, the princess said, continuing the previous conversation.",
      "Isn t it time to skim it, my dear?",
      "she added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "There s not the slightest need for you to do it, and it s hot for you, she said, stopping Kitty.",
      "I ll do it, said Dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup.",
      "How they ll enjoy this at tea-time!",
      "she thought of her children, remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was best of all the scum of the jam.",
      "Stiva says it s much better to give money.",
      "Dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to servants.",
      "But.... Money s out of the question!",
      "the princess and Kitty exclaimed with one voice.",
      "They appreciate a present.... Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a poplin, but something of that sort, said the princess.",
      "I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.",
      "A charming pattern so simple and refined, I should have liked it myself, if she hadn t had it.",
      "Something like Varenka s. So pretty and inexpensive.",
      "Well, now I think it s done, said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the spoon.",
      "When it sets as it drops, it s ready.",
      "Cook it a little longer, Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "The flies!",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna angrily.",
      "It ll be just the same, she added.",
      "how sweet it is!",
      "don t frighten it!",
      "Kitty said suddenly, looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry.",
      "Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove, said her mother.",
      "_ propos de Varenka_, said Kitty, speaking in French, as they had been doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna should not understand them, you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be settled today.",
      "You know what I mean.",
      "How splendid it would be!",
      "But what a famous matchmaker she is!",
      "How carefully and cleverly she throws them together!...",
      "No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?",
      "Why, what is one to think?",
      "He (_he_ meant Sergey Ivanovitch) might at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course, he s not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now.... She s a very nice girl, but he might.... Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing better could be imagined.",
      "In the first place, she s charming!",
      "said Kitty, crooking one of her fingers.",
      "He thinks her very attractive, that s certain, assented Dolly.",
      "Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife.",
      "All he needs is a good, sweet wife a restful one.",
      "Well, with her he would certainly be restful, Dolly assented.",
      "Thirdly, that she should love him.",
      "And so it is ... that is, it would be so splendid!...",
      "I look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest and everything settled.",
      "I shall see at once by their eyes.",
      "I should be so delighted!",
      "What do you think, Dolly?",
      "But don t excite yourself.",
      "It s not at all the thing for you to be excited, said her mother.",
      "Oh, I m not excited, mamma.",
      "I fancy he will make her an offer today.",
      "Ah, that s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!...",
      "There is a sort of barrier, and all at once it s broken down, said Dolly, smiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?",
      "Kitty asked suddenly.",
      "There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple, answered the princess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.",
      "Oh, but how was it?",
      "You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to speak?",
      "Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman s life.",
      "Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.",
      "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
      "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
      "It s always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles.... How nicely you said that, mamma!",
      "It s just by the eyes, by smiles that it s done, Dolly assented.",
      "But what words did he say?",
      "What did Kostya say to you?",
      "He wrote it in chalk.",
      "It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!",
      "And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing.",
      "Kitty was the first to break the silence.",
      "She remembered all that last winter before her marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.",
      "There s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka s, she said, a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point.",
      "I should have liked to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him.",
      "They re all all men, I mean, she added, awfully jealous over our past.",
      "Not all, said Dolly.",
      "You judge by your own husband.",
      "It makes him miserable even now to remember Vronsky.",
      "that s true, isn t it?",
      "Yes, Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.",
      "But I really don t know, the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter, what there was in your past that could worry him?",
      "That Vronsky paid you attentions that happens to every girl.",
      "Oh, yes, but we didn t mean that, Kitty said, flushing a little.",
      "No, let me speak, her mother went on, why, you yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky.",
      "Don t you remember?",
      "Oh, mamma!",
      "said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.",
      "There s no keeping you young people in check nowadays....",
      "Your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable.",
      "I should myself have called upon him to explain himself.",
      "But, my darling, it s not right for you to be agitated.",
      "Please remember that, and calm yourself.",
      "I m perfectly calm, maman.",
      "How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then, said Dolly, and how unhappy for her.",
      "It turned out quite the opposite, she said, struck by her own ideas.",
      "Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself unhappy.",
      "Now it is just the opposite.",
      "I often think of her.",
      "A nice person to think about!",
      "Horrid, repulsive woman no heart, said her mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky, but Levin.",
      "What do you want to talk of it for?",
      "Kitty said with annoyance.",
      "I never think about it, and I don t want to think of it.... And I don t want to think of it, she said, catching the sound of her husband s well-known step on the steps of the terrace.",
      "What s that you don t want to think about?",
      "inquired Levin, coming onto the terrace.",
      "But no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.",
      "I m sorry I ve broken in on your feminine parliament, he said, looking round on everyone discontentedly, and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him.",
      "For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea Mihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether at the outside Shtcherbatsky element.",
      "He smiled, however, and went up to Kitty.",
      "he asked her, looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now.",
      "Oh, very well, said Kitty, smiling, and how have things gone with you?",
      "The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did.",
      "Well, are we going for the children?",
      "I ve ordered the horses to be put in.",
      "you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?",
      "her mother said reproachfully.",
      "Yes, at a walking pace, princess.",
      "Levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their mothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so.",
      "But though he liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.",
      "Come with us, maman, said Kitty.",
      "I don t like to see such imprudence.",
      "Well, I ll walk then, I m so well.",
      "Kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand.",
      "You may be well, but everything in moderation, said the princess.",
      "Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?",
      "said Levin, smiling to Agafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up.",
      "Is it all right in the new way?",
      "I suppose it s all right.",
      "For our notions it s boiled too long.",
      "It ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won t mildew, even though our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we ve no cool cellar to store it, said Kitty, at once divining her husband s motive, and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling; but your pickle s so good, that mamma says she never tasted any like it, she added, smiling, and putting her kerchief straight.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.",
      "You needn t try to console me, mistress.",
      "I need only to look at you with him, and I feel happy, she said, and something in the rough familiarity of that _with him_ touched Kitty.",
      "Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best places.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as though to say: I should like to be angry with you too, but I can t. Do it, please, by my receipt, said the princess; put some paper over the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it will never go mildewy.",
      "Chapter 3 Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband, for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face always so quick to reflect every feeling at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of, and had got no answer.",
      "When they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn, she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her.",
      "He had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression, and alone with her he felt, now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in the being near to the woman he loved.",
      "There was no need of speech, yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child.",
      "In her voice, as in her eyes, there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.",
      "So you re not tired?",
      "Lean more on me, said he.",
      "No, I m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own, though I m happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.",
      "That was good, but this is even better.",
      "Both are better, he said, squeezing her hand.",
      "Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?",
      "About jam?",
      "Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers.",
      "said Levin, listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road, which passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she might make a false step.",
      "And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka.",
      "You ve noticed?...",
      "I m very anxious for it, she went on.",
      "And she peeped into his face.",
      "I don t know what to think, Levin answered, smiling.",
      "Sergey seems very strange to me in that way.",
      "I told you, you know....",
      "Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died.... That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and tradition.",
      "I remember him then.",
      "He was wonderfully sweet.",
      "But I ve watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes, but one feels that to him they re simply people, not women.",
      "Yes, but now with Varenka ...",
      "I fancy there s something.... Perhaps there is....",
      "But one has to know him....",
      "He s a peculiar, wonderful person.",
      "He lives a spiritual life only.",
      "He s too pure, too exalted a nature.",
      "Would this lower him, then?",
      "No, but he s so used to a spiritual life that he can t reconcile himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.",
      "Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language.",
      "He knew that his wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.",
      "Yes, but there s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me.",
      "I can see that he would never have cared for me.",
      "She is altogether spiritual.",
      "Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people like you....",
      "Yes, he s very nice to me; but....",
      "It s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each other, Levin finished.",
      "Why not speak of him?",
      "I sometimes blame myself for not; it ends in one s forgetting.",
      "Ah, how terrible and dear he was!...",
      "Yes, what were we talking about?",
      "Levin said, after a pause.",
      "You think he can t fall in love, said Kitty, translating into her own language.",
      "It s not so much that he can t fall in love, Levin said, smiling, but he has not the weakness necessary....",
      "I ve always envied him, and even now, when I m so happy, I still envy him.",
      "You envy him for not being able to fall in love?",
      "I envy him for being better than I, said Levin.",
      "He does not live for himself.",
      "His whole life is subordinated to his duty.",
      "And that s why he can be calm and contented.",
      "And you?",
      "Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.",
      "She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile; but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.",
      "Kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be better she loved it in him, and so she smiled.",
      "What are you dissatisfied with?",
      "she asked, with the same smile.",
      "Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief.",
      "I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself.... he said.",
      "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
      "Well, how shall I say?...",
      "In my heart I really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble see?",
      "Oh, but really you mustn t skip about like that!",
      "he cried, breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.",
      "But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others, especially with my brother, I feel I m a poor creature.",
      "But in what way?",
      "Kitty pursued with the same smile.",
      "Don t you too work for others?",
      "What about your co-operative settlement, and your work on the estate, and your book?...",
      "Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now it s your fault, he said, pressing her hand that all that doesn t count.",
      "I do it in a way halfheartedly.",
      "If I could care for all that as I care for you!...",
      "Instead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.",
      "Well, what would you say about papa?",
      "Is he a poor creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?",
      "But then one must have the simplicity, the straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven t got that.",
      "I do nothing, and I fret about it.",
      "It s all your doing.",
      "Before there was you and _this_ too, he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood I put all my energies into work; now I can t, and I m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I m pretending.... Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey Ivanovitch?",
      "Would you like to do this work for the general good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing else?",
      "Of course not, said Levin.",
      "But I m so happy that I don t understand anything.",
      "So you think he ll make her an offer today?",
      "he added after a brief silence.",
      "I think so, and I don t think so.",
      "Only, I m awfully anxious for it.",
      "Here, wait a minute.",
      "She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.",
      "Come, count: he does propose, he doesn t, she said, giving him the flower.",
      "He does, he doesn t, said Levin, tearing off the white petals.",
      "Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him.",
      "She had been watching his fingers with interest.",
      "You picked off two.",
      "Oh, but see, this little one shan t count to make up, said Levin, tearing off a little half-grown petal.",
      "Here s the wagonette overtaking us.",
      "Aren t you tired, Kitty?",
      "called the princess.",
      "Not in the least.",
      "If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.",
      "But it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place, and all walked on together.",
      "Chapter 4 Varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for, was very attractive.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her, and never left off admiring her.",
      "Looking at her, he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the good he knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long, long ago, and only once, in his early youth.",
      "The feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he looked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself, and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.",
      "If so, he said to himself, I ought to think it over and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.",
      "I m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show, he said, and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel.",
      "Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins.",
      "It was perfectly still all round him.",
      "Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children s voices were floated across to him.",
      "All at once he heard, not far from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka s contralto voice, calling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch s face.",
      "Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it.",
      "For a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree.",
      "The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out.",
      "At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant cigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree.",
      "Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on, deliberating on his position.",
      "If it were only a passing fancy or a passion, if it were only this attraction this mutual attraction (I can call it a _mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life if I felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it s not so.",
      "The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie, I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory.",
      "That s the only thing I can say against my feeling.... That s a great thing, Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others.",
      "But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never find anything to say against my feeling.",
      "If I were choosing by considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything better.",
      "However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the qualities he would wish to see in his wife.",
      "She had all the charm and freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.",
      "Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch s conception of the woman who was to share his life.",
      "Thirdly: she was religious, and not like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for example, was, but her life was founded on religious principles.",
      "Even in trifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband s house, as he saw now in Kitty s case.",
      "She would owe everything to her husband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family life.",
      "And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him.",
      "He was a modest man, but he could not help seeing it.",
      "And he loved her.",
      "There was one consideration against it his age.",
      "But he came of a long-lived family, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he remembered Varenka s saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers himself _dans la force de l ge_, while a man of forty is _un jeune homme_.",
      "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
      "Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?",
      "His heart throbbed joyously.",
      "A softened feeling came over him.",
      "He felt that he had made up his mind.",
      "Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round.",
      "Flinging away the cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her.",
      "Chapter 5 Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the ideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife.",
      "I have lived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I sought in you.",
      "I love you, and offer you my hand.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from Varvara.",
      "Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.",
      "Come here, little ones!",
      "There are so many!",
      "she was saying in her sweet, deep voice.",
      "Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she did not get up and did not change her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it.",
      "Well, did you find some?",
      "she asked from under the white kerchief, turning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.",
      "Not one, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Did you?",
      "She did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.",
      "That one too, near the twig, she pointed out to little Masha a little fungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself.",
      "Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves.",
      "This brings back my childhood, she added, moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "They walked on for some steps in silence.",
      "Varenka saw that he wanted to speak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic.",
      "They had walked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did not begin to speak.",
      "It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.",
      "After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms.",
      "But against her own will, as it were accidentally, Varenka said: So you found nothing?",
      "In the middle of the wood there are always fewer, though.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer.",
      "He was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms.",
      "He wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after a pause of some length, as though against his own will, he made an observation in response to her last words.",
      "I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood, though I can t tell them apart.",
      "Some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the children, and were quite alone.",
      "Varenka s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again.",
      "To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame Stahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness.",
      "Besides, she was almost certain that she was in love with him.",
      "And this moment it would have to be decided.",
      "She felt frightened.",
      "She dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking.",
      "Now or never it must be said that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.",
      "Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her.",
      "He felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her.",
      "Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision.",
      "He even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his offer, but instead of those words, some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask: What is the difference between the birch mushroom and the white mushroom?",
      "Varenka s lips quivered with emotion as she answered: In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it s in the stalk.",
      "And as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it was over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their emotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense, began to subside.",
      "The birch mushroom s stalk suggests a dark man s chin after two days without shaving, said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.",
      "Yes, that s true, answered Varenka smiling, and unconsciously the direction of their walk changed.",
      "They began to turn towards the children.",
      "Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had a sense of relief.",
      "When he had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey Ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one.",
      "He could not be false to the memory of Marie.",
      "Gently, children, gently!",
      "Levin shouted quite angrily to the children, standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.",
      "Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the wood.",
      "Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.",
      "her husband questioned her as they were going home again.",
      "It doesn t bite, said Kitty, her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father, a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure.",
      "How doesn t bite?",
      "I ll show you, she said, taking her husband s hand, lifting it to her mouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips.",
      "Like a kiss on a priest s hand.",
      "Which didn t it bite with?",
      "he said, laughing.",
      "Both.",
      "But it should have been like this....",
      "There are some peasants coming.... Oh, they didn t see.",
      "Chapter 6 During the time of the children s tea the grown-up people sat in the balcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all, especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that there had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great importance.",
      "They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or shut him out of the school forever.",
      "Everyone present, feeling too that something had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects.",
      "Levin and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening.",
      "And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not and they felt a prick of conscience.",
      "Mark my words, Alexander will not come, said the old princess.",
      "That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by train, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.",
      "And I know why, the princess went on; he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.",
      "But papa has left us alone.",
      "We ve never seen him, said Kitty.",
      "Besides, we re not young people!",
      "we re old, married people by now.",
      "Only if he doesn t come, I shall say good-bye to you children, said the princess, sighing mournfully.",
      "What nonsense, mamma!",
      "both the daughters fell upon her at once.",
      "How do you suppose he is feeling?",
      "Why, now.... And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess s voice.",
      "Her daughters were silent, and looked at one another.",
      "Maman always finds something to be miserable about, they said in that glance.",
      "They did not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter s house, and useful as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely miserable, both on her own account and her husband s, ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been left empty.",
      "What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?",
      "Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea Mihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of meaning.",
      "About supper.",
      "Well, that s right, said Dolly; you go and arrange about it, and I ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing done all day.",
      "That s my lesson!",
      "No, Dolly, I m going, said Levin, jumping up.",
      "Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, who had been studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on coming to the Levins to go over with him, at least once a day, the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic.",
      "Levin had offered to take her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin s lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.",
      "Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly.",
      "But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as she wished.",
      "And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour of the lesson.",
      "So it had been today.",
      "No, I m going, Dolly, you sit still, he said.",
      "We ll do it all properly, like the book.",
      "Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.",
      "And Levin went to Grisha.",
      "Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty.",
      "Even in the happy, well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making herself useful.",
      "I ll see to the supper, you sit still, she said, and got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "Yes, yes, most likely they ve not been able to get chickens.",
      "If so, ours.... Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it, and Varenka vanished with her.",
      "What a nice girl!",
      "Not nice, maman; she s an exquisite girl; there s no one else like her.",
      "So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about Varenka.",
      "It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike than yours, he said with a subtle smile.",
      "One all movement, only living in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively, alert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.",
      "Yes, he s very heedless, said the princess, addressing Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it s out of the question for her (she indicated Kitty) to stay here; that she positively must come to Moscow.",
      "He talks of getting a doctor down.... Maman, he ll do everything; he has agreed to everything, Kitty said, angry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in such a matter.",
      "In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel.",
      "Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where Grisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him.",
      "It s Stiva!",
      "Levin shouted from under the balcony.",
      "We ve finished, Dolly, don t be afraid!",
      "he added, and started running like a boy to meet the carriage.",
      "_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_ shouted Grisha, skipping along the avenue.",
      "And someone else too!",
      "Papa, of course!",
      "cried Levin, stopping at the entrance of the avenue.",
      "Kitty, don t come down the steep staircase, go round.",
      "But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince.",
      "As he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind.",
      "This was Vassenka Veslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society.",
      "A capital fellow, and a keen sportsman, as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.",
      "Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had brought with him.",
      "Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind.",
      "He was rather vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person.",
      "He seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm and gallant air, kissing Kitty s hand.",
      "Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends, said Vassenka Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin s hand with great warmth.",
      "Well, are there plenty of birds?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin, hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings.",
      "We ve come with the most savage intentions.",
      "Why, maman, they ve not been in Moscow since!",
      "Look, Tanya, here s something for you!",
      "Get it, please, it s in the carriage, behind!",
      "he talked in all directions.",
      "How pretty you ve grown, Dolly, he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding it in one of his, and patting it with the other.",
      "Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.",
      "Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?",
      "he thought, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch s tender demonstrations to his wife.",
      "He looked at Dolly, and he did not like her either.",
      "She doesn t believe in his love.",
      "So what is she so pleased about?",
      "Revolting!",
      "He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before, and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka, with his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.",
      "Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected Oblonsky.",
      "And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_ making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married.",
      "And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else.",
      "And, above all, unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his smile.",
      "Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were all seated, Levin turned and went out.",
      "Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband.",
      "She tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her, saying he was wanted at the counting-house.",
      "It was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.",
      "It s all holiday for them, he thought; but these are no holiday matters, they won t wait, and there s no living without them.",
      "Chapter 7 Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper.",
      "On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna, consulting about wines for supper.",
      "But why are you making all this fuss?",
      "Have what we usually do.",
      "No, Stiva doesn t drink ... Kostya, stop, what s the matter?",
      "Kitty began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",
      "Please, do let s go, said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.",
      "I shall be delighted, we will go.",
      "And have you had any shooting yet this year?",
      "said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him, and that was so out of keeping with him.",
      "I can t answer for our finding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe.",
      "Only we ought to start early.",
      "Aren t you tired, Stiva?",
      "Me tired?",
      "I ve never been tired yet.",
      "Suppose we stay up all night.",
      "Let s go for a walk!",
      "Yes, really, let s not go to bed at all!",
      "Veslovsky chimed in.",
      "Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up too, Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband.",
      "But to my thinking, it s time for bed now....",
      "I m going, I don t want supper.",
      "No, do stay a little, Dolly, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper.",
      "I ve so much still to tell you.",
      "Nothing really, I suppose.",
      "Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna s, and he s going to them again?",
      "You know they re hardly fifty miles from you, and I too must certainly go over there.",
      "Veslovsky, come here!",
      "Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.",
      "Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her?",
      "How was she?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him.",
      "Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky.",
      "And that was not all.",
      "He saw on his wife s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them something with great animation.",
      "It s exceedingly nice at their place, Veslovsky was telling them about Vronsky and Anna.",
      "I can t, of course, take it upon myself to judge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.",
      "What do they intend doing?",
      "I believe they think of going to Moscow.",
      "How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together!",
      "When are you going there?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.",
      "I m spending July there.",
      "Will you go?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.",
      "I ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go, said Dolly.",
      "I am sorry for her, and I know her.",
      "She s a splendid woman.",
      "I will go alone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one s way.",
      "And it will be better indeed without you.",
      "To be sure, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And you, Kitty?",
      "Why should I go?",
      "Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced round at her husband.",
      "Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?",
      "Veslovsky asked her.",
      "She s a very fascinating woman.",
      "Yes, she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more.",
      "She got up and walked across to her husband.",
      "Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?",
      "His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far indeed.",
      "Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own fashion.",
      "Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.",
      "Yes, I m going, he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to himself.",
      "No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won t see anything of her husband, and set off the day after, said Kitty.",
      "The motive of Kitty s words was interpreted by Levin thus: Don t separate me from _him_.",
      "I don t care about _your_ going, but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.",
      "Oh, if you wish, we ll stay here tomorrow, Levin answered, with peculiar amiability.",
      "Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.",
      "Levin saw that look.",
      "He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly breathe.",
      "How dare he look at my wife like that!",
      "was the feeling that boiled within him.",
      "Tomorrow, then?",
      "Do, please, let us go, said Vassenka, sitting down on a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.",
      "Levin s jealousy went further still.",
      "Already he saw himself a deceived husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life....",
      "But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next day.",
      "Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed.",
      "But even at this point Levin could not escape another agony.",
      "As he said good-night to his hostess, Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew back her hand and said with a na ve bluntness, for which the old princess scolded her afterwards: We don t like that fashion.",
      "In Levin s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them.",
      "Why, how can one want to go to bed!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most charming and sentimental humor.",
      "Look, Kitty, he said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees how exquisite!",
      "Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade.",
      "You know, he has a splendid voice; we practiced songs together along the road.",
      "He has brought some lovely songs with him, two new ones.",
      "Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets.",
      "When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs.",
      "Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife s bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong.",
      "But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question: Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky?",
      "it all burst out, and he told her all.",
      "He was humiliated himself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all the more.",
      "He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in.",
      "The expression of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her.",
      "His jaws were twitching, and his voice kept breaking.",
      "You must understand that I m not jealous, that s a nasty word.",
      "I can t be jealous, and believe that....",
      "I can t say what I feel, but this is awful....",
      "I m not jealous, but I m wounded, humiliated that anybody dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.",
      "Eyes like what?",
      "said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them.",
      "At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so increase his suffering.",
      "And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...",
      "he cried, clutching at his head, you shouldn t say that!...",
      "If you had been attractive then.... Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!",
      "she said, looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration.",
      "Why, what can you be thinking about!",
      "When for me there s no one in the world, no one, no one!...",
      "Would you like me never to see anyone?",
      "For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from the agony he was suffering.",
      "You must understand the horror and comedy of my position, he went on in a desperate whisper; that he s in my house, that he s done nothing improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs.",
      "He thinks it s the best possible form, and so I m obliged to be civil to him.",
      "But, Kostya, you re exaggerating, said Kitty, at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his jealousy.",
      "The most awful part of it all is that you re just as you always are, and especially now when to me you re something sacred, and we re so happy, so particularly happy and all of a sudden a little wretch....",
      "He s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him?",
      "I have nothing to do with him.",
      "But why should my, and your, happiness.... Do you know, I understand now what it s all come from, Kitty was beginning.",
      "Well, what?",
      "I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.",
      "Levin said in dismay.",
      "She told him what they had been talking about.",
      "And as she told him, she was breathless with emotion.",
      "Levin was silent for a space, then he scanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his head.",
      "Katya, I ve been worrying you!",
      "Darling, forgive me!",
      "It s madness!",
      "Katya, I m a criminal.",
      "And how could you be so distressed at such idiocy?",
      "Oh, I was sorry for you.",
      "For me?",
      "How mad I am!...",
      "But why make you miserable?",
      "It s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.",
      "It s humiliating too, of course.",
      "Oh, then I ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him with civility, said Levin, kissing her hands.",
      "Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.",
      "Chapter 8 Next day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning that they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and fro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and, disapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out.",
      "The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling.",
      "Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen.",
      "At last the door opened with a creak, and Stepan Arkadyevitch s spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round and round and turning over in the air.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth.",
      "Good dog, good dog, Krak!",
      "he cried encouragingly to the dog, who put his paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers and a short coat.",
      "On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his game bag and cartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly _chic_ for a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality.",
      "He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a typical Russian nobleman.",
      "And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get-up.",
      "Well, and what about our host?",
      "A young wife, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "Yes, and such a charming one!",
      "He came down dressed.",
      "No doubt he s run up to her again.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right.",
      "Levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and, moreover, to beg her for Christ s sake to be more careful.",
      "The great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute push against her.",
      "Then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well with her.",
      "Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him cheerfully.",
      "Pardon, gentlemen!",
      "he said, running out onto the steps.",
      "Have you put the lunch in?",
      "Why is the chestnut on the right?",
      "Well, it doesn t matter.",
      "Laska, down; go and lie down!",
      "Put it with the herd of oxen, he said to the herdsman, who was waiting for him at the steps with some question.",
      "Excuse me, here comes another villain.",
      "Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his seat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand.",
      "You didn t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you re detaining me.",
      "Would your honor let me make another turning?",
      "It s only three steps to add.",
      "And we make it just fit at the same time.",
      "It will be much more convenient.",
      "You should have listened to me, Levin answered with annoyance.",
      "I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps.",
      "Now there s no setting it right.",
      "Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.",
      "The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place.",
      "Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add three steps.",
      "It will be much better.",
      "But where s your staircase coming out with its three steps?",
      "Why, upon my word, sir, the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.",
      "It comes out right at the very spot.",
      "It starts, so to speak, he said, with a persuasive gesture; it comes down, and comes down, and comes out.",
      "But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come out?",
      "Why, to be sure, it ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and come out so, the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.",
      "It ll reach the ceiling and the wall.",
      "Upon my word!",
      "Why, it ll go up, and up, and come out like this.",
      "Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust.",
      "There, do you see?",
      "As your honor likes, said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last.",
      "It seems it ll be best to make a new one.",
      "Well, then, do it as you re told, Levin shouted, seating himself in the wagonette.",
      "Down!",
      "Hold the dogs, Philip!",
      "Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk.",
      "Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action.",
      "If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and whether he would shoot well that day himself.",
      "Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator not to be outdone by Oblonsky that too was a thought that crossed his brain.",
      "Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter.",
      "As he listened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before.",
      "Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple, good-hearted, and very good-humored.",
      "If Levin had met him before he was married, he would have made friends with him.",
      "Levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance.",
      "It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding.",
      "Levin liked him for his good education, for speaking French and English with such an excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.",
      "Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don Steppes.",
      "He kept praising him enthusiastically.",
      "How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse!",
      "isn t it?",
      "He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort.",
      "But his simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and the grace of his movements, was very attractive.",
      "Either because his nature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him, anyway he liked his society.",
      "After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table.",
      "In the pocketbook there were thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.",
      "Do you know what, Levin, I ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.",
      "That will be splendid.",
      "he said, preparing to get out.",
      "answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone.",
      "I ll send the coachman.",
      "The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the remaining pair.",
      "Chapter 9 Well, now what s our plan of campaign?",
      "Tell us all about it, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Our plan is this.",
      "Now we re driving to Gvozdyov.",
      "In Gvozdyov there s a grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too.",
      "It s hot now, and we ll get there it s fifteen miles or so towards evening and have some evening shooting; we ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors.",
      "And is there nothing on the way?",
      "Yes; but we ll reserve ourselves; besides it s hot.",
      "There are two nice little places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.",
      "Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they were near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only little places there would hardly be room for three to shoot.",
      "And so, with some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot.",
      "When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once detected reeds visible from the road.",
      "Shan t we try that?",
      "he said, pointing to the little marsh.",
      "Levin, do, please!",
      "how delightful!",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky began begging, and Levin could but consent.",
      "Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh.",
      "Krak!",
      "Laska!...",
      "The dogs came back.",
      "There won t be room for three.",
      "I ll stay here, said Levin, hoping they would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs, and turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the marsh.",
      "Come along, Levin, let s go together!",
      "Veslovsky called.",
      "Really, there s not room.",
      "Laska, back, Laska!",
      "You won t want another dog, will you?",
      "Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the sportsmen.",
      "They walked right across the marsh.",
      "Except little birds and peewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.",
      "Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh, said Levin, only it s wasting time.",
      "Oh, no, it was jolly all the same.",
      "Did you see us?",
      "said Vassenka Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands.",
      "How splendidly I shot this bird!",
      "Didn t I?",
      "Well, shall we soon be getting to the real place?",
      "The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the stock of someone s gun, and there was the report of a shot.",
      "The gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin.",
      "It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the other hammer still cocked.",
      "The charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky.",
      "But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.",
      "In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin s forehead.",
      "And besides, Veslovsky was at first so na vely distressed, and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him.",
      "When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to pass it by.",
      "But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him.",
      "Again, as the marsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.",
      "Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog.",
      "Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come up, a grouse flew out.",
      "Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow.",
      "This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up.",
      "Krak found it again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.",
      "Now you go and I ll stay with the horses, he said.",
      "Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman s envy.",
      "He handed the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.",
      "Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that Levin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.",
      "Why don t you stop her?",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "She won t scare them, answered Levin, sympathizing with his bitch s pleasure and hurrying after her.",
      "As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in Laska s exploration.",
      "A little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant.",
      "She made one circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless.",
      "Come, come, Stiva!",
      "shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud, began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance.",
      "He heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse.",
      "He heard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could not explain to himself.",
      "Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.",
      "Fetch it!",
      "Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog.",
      "Levin had lifted his gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of Veslovsky s voice, shouting something with strange loudness.",
      "Levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.",
      "When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.",
      "Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got the horses stuck in the mud.",
      "Damn the fellow!",
      "Levin said to himself, as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire.",
      "What did you drive in for?",
      "he said to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the horses out.",
      "Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing.",
      "Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses.",
      "But then, as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it indeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness.",
      "When everything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch served.",
      "_Bon app tit bonne conscience!",
      "Ce poulet va tomber jusqu au fond de mes bottes_, Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the French saying as he finished his second chicken.",
      "Well, now our troubles are over, now everything s going to go well.",
      "Only, to atone for my sins, I m bound to sit on the box.",
      "That s so?",
      "I ll be your Automedon.",
      "You shall see how I ll get you along, he answered, not letting go the rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman drive.",
      "No, I must atone for my sins, and I m very comfortable on the box.",
      "And he drove.",
      "Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the chestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.",
      "Chapter 10 Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early, while it was still hot.",
      "As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.",
      "How shall we go?",
      "It s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds.",
      "Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.",
      "Now, gentlemen, said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, do you see those reeds?",
      "He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.",
      "The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, do you see where it is greener?",
      "From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that alder, and right up to the mill.",
      "Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",
      "That s the best place.",
      "There I once shot seventeen snipe.",
      "We ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet over there at the mill.",
      "Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",
      "It s wider to the right; you two go that way and I ll take the left, he said with apparent carelessness.",
      "we ll make the bigger bag!",
      "Yes, come along, come along!",
      "Vassenka exclaimed.",
      "Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.",
      "As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool.",
      "Levin knew Laska s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe.",
      "Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!",
      "he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him.",
      "Levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.",
      "Oh, I won t get in your way, don t trouble about me.",
      "But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty s words at parting: Mind you don t shoot one another.",
      "The dogs came nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.",
      "The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.",
      "Bang!",
      "sounded almost in his ear.",
      "Vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen, far out of range.",
      "Before Levin had time to look round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some eight more rose one after another.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.",
      "Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath.",
      "Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed; he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he missed again.",
      "While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky, who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the water.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin.",
      "Well, now let us separate, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog, he walked off in one direction.",
      "Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other.",
      "It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day.",
      "So it was that day.",
      "The snipe showed themselves in numbers.",
      "They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen s legs, and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck.",
      "But the more he shot, the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success.",
      "Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting.",
      "Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.",
      "She began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes.",
      "Shots followed shots in rapid succession.",
      "The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen, while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe.",
      "And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together.",
      "Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch s shots, not frequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard Krak, Krak, _apporte_!",
      "This excited Levin still more.",
      "The snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds.",
      "Their whirring wings close to the earth, and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again before the sportsmen.",
      "Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.",
      "After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing-grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the trampled grass, in another by a path mown through it.",
      "Half of these strips had already been mown.",
      "Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.",
      "Hi, sportsmen!",
      "shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an unharnessed cart; come and have some lunch with us!",
      "Have a drop of wine!",
      "Levin looked round.",
      "Come along, it s all right!",
      "shouted a good-humored-looking bearded peasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.",
      "_Qu est-ce qu ils disent_?",
      "asked Veslovsky.",
      "They invite you to have some vodka.",
      "Most likely they ve been dividing the meadow into lots.",
      "I should have some, said Levin, not without some guile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go away to them.",
      "Why do they offer it?",
      "Oh, they re merry-making.",
      "Really, you should join them.",
      "You would be interested.",
      "_Allons, c est curieux_.",
      "You go, you go, you ll find the way to the mill!",
      "cried Levin, and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and stumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm s length, was making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.",
      "You come too!",
      "the peasants shouted to Levin.",
      "Never fear!",
      "You taste our cake!",
      "Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread.",
      "He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated.",
      "But Laska was setting.",
      "And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog.",
      "A snipe flew up at his feet; he fired and killed it.",
      "Laska still pointed.",
      "Another bird flew up close to the dog.",
      "Levin fired.",
      "But it was an unlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for the one he had shot, he could not find that either.",
      "He wandered all about the reeds, but Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he sent her to find it, she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really.",
      "And in the absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure, things went no better.",
      "There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made one miss after another.",
      "The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked through with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat ran in drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the bitter taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not touch the stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short, rapid throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he walked on and still he shot.",
      "At last, after a disgraceful miss, he flung his gun and his hat on the ground.",
      "No, I must control myself, he said to himself.",
      "Picking up his gun and his hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp.",
      "When he got on to dry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it, then walked to the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his burning hot gun, and washed his face and hands.",
      "Feeling refreshed, he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.",
      "He tried to be calm, but it was the same again.",
      "His finger pressed the cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird.",
      "It got worse and worse.",
      "He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog.",
      "Krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at Laska.",
      "Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He came to meet him, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way.",
      "You have been popping away!",
      "he said, smiling good-humoredly.",
      "How have you got on?",
      "But there was no need to ask, for he had already seen the full game bag.",
      "Oh, pretty fair.",
      "He had fourteen birds.",
      "A splendid marsh!",
      "I ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way.",
      "It s awkward too, shooting with one dog, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, to soften his triumph.",
      "Chapter 11 When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant s hut where Levin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there.",
      "He was sitting in the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant s wife, who was helping him off with his miry boots.",
      "Veslovsky was laughing his infectious, good-humored laugh.",
      "I ve only just come.",
      "_Ils ont t charmants_.",
      "Just fancy, they gave me drink, fed me!",
      "Such bread, it was exquisite!",
      "_D licieux!_ And the vodka, I never tasted any better.",
      "And they would not take a penny for anything.",
      "And they kept saying: Excuse our homely ways.",
      "What should they take anything for?",
      "They were entertaining you, to be sure.",
      "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
      "said the soldier, succeeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened stocking.",
      "In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of marsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives and forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen.",
      "Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn swept ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen.",
      "Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.",
      "After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and of former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them.",
      "After Vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at Malthus s, where he had stayed the previous summer.",
      "Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by speculation in railway shares.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they were preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh.",
      "I don t understand you, said Levin, sitting up in the hay; how is it such people don t disgust you?",
      "I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is all very pleasant, but don t you dislike just that very sumptuousness?",
      "All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone.",
      "They don t care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved.",
      "Perfectly true!",
      "chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky.",
      "Perfectly!",
      "Oblonsky, of course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say: Well, Oblonsky stays with them.",
      "... Not a bit of it.",
      "Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he spoke.",
      "I simply don t consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman.",
      "They ve all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence.",
      "Oh, by what work?",
      "Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them?",
      "Of course it s work.",
      "Work in this sense, that if it were not for him and others like him, there would have been no railways.",
      "But that s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned profession.",
      "Granted, but it s work in the sense that his activity produces a result the railways.",
      "But of course you think the railways useless.",
      "No, that s another question; I am prepared to admit that they re useful.",
      "But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest.",
      "But who is to define what is proportionate?",
      "Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery, said Levin, conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.",
      "Such as banking, for instance, he went on.",
      "It s an evil the amassing of huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies, it s only the form that s changed.",
      "_Le roi est mort, vive le roi_.",
      "No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without work.",
      "Yes, that may all be very true and clever....",
      "Lie down, Krak!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching and turning over all the hay.",
      "He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position, and so talked serenely and without haste.",
      "But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work.",
      "That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I do that s dishonest, I suppose?",
      "I can t say.",
      "Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let s say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here, however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus getting more than a station-master.",
      "No, quite the contrary; I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which is utterly baseless, and I fancy there s envy at the bottom of it.... No, that s unfair, said Veslovsky; how could envy come in?",
      "There is something not nice about that sort of business.",
      "You say, Levin went on, that it s unjust for me to receive five thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that s true.",
      "It is unfair, and I feel it, but....",
      "It really is.",
      "Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting, doing nothing, while they are forever at work?",
      "said Vassenka Veslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.",
      "Yes, you feel it, but you don t give him your property, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin.",
      "There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it began to take a personal note.",
      "I don t give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I wanted to, I could not give it away, answered Levin, and have no one to give it to.",
      "Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.",
      "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
      "Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance?",
      "I don t know; but if you are convinced that you have no right....",
      "I m not at all convinced.",
      "On the contrary, I feel I have no right to give it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.",
      "No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is it you don t act accordingly?...",
      "Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me.",
      "No, excuse me, that s a paradox.",
      "Yes, there s something of a sophistry about that, Veslovsky agreed.",
      "our host; so you re not asleep yet?",
      "he said to the peasant who came into the barn, opening the creaking door.",
      "How is it you re not asleep?",
      "No, how s one to sleep!",
      "I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I heard them chattering.",
      "I want to get a hook from here.",
      "She won t bite?",
      "he added, stepping cautiously with his bare feet.",
      "And where are you going to sleep?",
      "We are going out for the night with the beasts.",
      "Ah, what a night!",
      "said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors.",
      "But listen, there are women s voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too.",
      "Who s that singing, my friend?",
      "That s the maids from hard by here.",
      "Let s go, let s have a walk!",
      "We shan t go to sleep, you know.",
      "Oblonsky, come along!",
      "If one could only do both, lie here and go, answered Oblonsky, stretching.",
      "It s capital lying here.",
      "Well, I shall go by myself, said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and putting on his shoes and stockings.",
      "Good-bye, gentlemen.",
      "If it s fun, I ll fetch you.",
      "You ve treated me to some good sport, and I won t forget you.",
      "He really is a capital fellow, isn t he?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him.",
      "Yes, capital, answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before.",
      "It seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity, and yet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries.",
      "This disconcerted him.",
      "It s just this, my dear boy.",
      "One must do one of two things: either admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for one s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.",
      "No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied at least I could not.",
      "The great thing for me is to feel that I m not to blame.",
      "What do you say, why not go after all?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, evidently weary of the strain of thought.",
      "Come, let s go!",
      "Levin did not answer.",
      "What they had said in the conversation, that he acted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts.",
      "Can it be that it s only possible to be just negatively?",
      "he was asking himself.",
      "How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up.",
      "There s not a chance of sleeping.",
      "Vassenka has been getting up some fun there.",
      "Do you hear the laughing and his voice?",
      "Hadn t we better go?",
      "Come along!",
      "No, I m not coming, answered Levin.",
      "Surely that s not a matter of principle too, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.",
      "It s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
      "But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.",
      "Do you suppose I don t see the line you ve taken up with your wife?",
      "I heard how it s a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not you re to be away for a couple of days shooting.",
      "That s all very well as an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won t answer.",
      "A man must be independent; he has his masculine interests.",
      "A man has to be manly, said Oblonsky, opening the door.",
      "To go running after servant girls?",
      "Why not, if it amuses him?",
      "_ a ne tire pas cons quence_.",
      "It won t do my wife any harm, and it ll amuse me.",
      "The great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home.",
      "There should be nothing in the home.",
      "But don t tie your own hands.",
      "Perhaps so, said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side.",
      "Tomorrow, early, I want to go shooting, and I won t wake anyone, and shall set off at daybreak.",
      "_Messieurs, venez vite!_ they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming back.",
      "_Charmante!_ I ve made such a discovery.",
      "_Charmante!_ a perfect Gretchen, and I ve already made friends with her.",
      "Really, exceedingly pretty, he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account, and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him.",
      "Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers, and lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices were lost.",
      "For a long while Levin could not get to sleep.",
      "He heard the horses munching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready for the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn, with his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host.",
      "He heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky, sleepy voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh, and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the boy s questions, he said, Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you ll catch it, and soon after he began snoring himself, and everything was still.",
      "He could only hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.",
      "Is it really only negative?",
      "And he began thinking about the next day.",
      "Tomorrow I ll go out early, and I ll make a point of keeping cool.",
      "There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too.",
      "When I come back there ll be the note from Kitty.",
      "Yes, Stiva may be right, I m not manly with her, I m tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can t be helped!",
      "Negative again.... Half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were standing talking.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably said to him by a peasant: Ah, you do your best to get round her!",
      "Levin, half asleep, said: Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!",
      "and fell asleep.",
      "Chapter 12 Waking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.",
      "Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out, was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response.",
      "Oblonsky, half asleep, declined to get up so early.",
      "Even Laska, who was asleep, curled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other.",
      "Getting on his boots and stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn, Levin went out into the road.",
      "The coachmen were sleeping in their carriages, the horses were dozing.",
      "Only one was lazily eating oats, dipping its nose into the manger.",
      "It was still gray out-of-doors.",
      "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
      "the old woman, their hostess, said, coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend.",
      "Going shooting, granny.",
      "Do I go this way to the marsh?",
      "Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp patches; there s a little footpath.",
      "Stepping carefully with her sunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor.",
      "Straight on and you ll come to the marsh.",
      "Our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening.",
      "Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path.",
      "Levin followed her with a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky.",
      "He hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh.",
      "But the sun did not delay.",
      "The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver.",
      "The pink flush of dawn, which one could not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all.",
      "What were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen.",
      "They were sheaves of rye.",
      "The dew, not visible till the sun was up, wetted Levin s legs and his blouse above his belt in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the pollen had already fallen out.",
      "In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible.",
      "A bee flew by Levin s ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet.",
      "He looked carefully, and saw a second and a third.",
      "They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh.",
      "The path led straight to the marsh.",
      "The marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another, so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.",
      "At the edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had been herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats.",
      "Not far from them were three hobbled horses.",
      "One of them clanked a chain.",
      "Laska walked beside her master, pressing a little forward and looking round.",
      "Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds, Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off.",
      "One of the horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started away, switched its tail and snorted.",
      "The other horses too were frightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs, and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound, they bounded out of the marsh.",
      "Laska stopped, looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at Levin.",
      "Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a sign that she might begin.",
      "Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her.",
      "Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh plants, and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of that strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other.",
      "Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong, but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter.",
      "To find the direction, she had to go farther away from the wind.",
      "Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a stiff gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right, away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned facing the wind.",
      "Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her, and not one, but many.",
      "Laska slackened her speed.",
      "They were here, but where precisely she could not yet determine.",
      "To find the very spot, she began to make a circle, when suddenly her master s voice drew her off.",
      "Laska!",
      "here?",
      "he asked, pointing her to a different direction.",
      "She stopped, asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun.",
      "But he repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing to a spot covered with water, where there could not be anything.",
      "She obeyed him, pretending she was looking, so as to please him, went round it, and went back to her former position, and was at once aware of the scent again.",
      "Now when he was not hindering her, she knew what to do, and without looking at what was under her feet, and to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with her strong, supple legs, she began making the circle which was to make all clear to her.",
      "The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger, and more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in front of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still and rigid.",
      "On her short legs she could see nothing in front of her, but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off.",
      "She stood still, feeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.",
      "Her tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the extreme end.",
      "Her mouth was slightly open, her ears raised.",
      "One ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but warily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her eyes than her head, to her master.",
      "He was coming along with the face she knew so well, though the eyes were always terrible to her.",
      "He stumbled over the stump as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly.",
      "She thought he came slowly, but he was running.",
      "Noticing Laska s special attitude as she crouched on the ground, as it were, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth slightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an inward prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to her.",
      "Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond her, and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose.",
      "In a space between two little thickets, at a couple of yards distance, he could see a grouse.",
      "Turning its head, it was listening.",
      "Then lightly preening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail.",
      "Fetch it, fetch it!",
      "shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.",
      "But I can t go, thought Laska.",
      "Where am I to go?",
      "From here I feel them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are.",
      "But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited whisper said, Fetch it, Laska.",
      "Well, if that s what he wishes, I ll do it, but I can t answer for myself now, she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would carry her between the thick bushes.",
      "She scented nothing now; she could only see and hear, without understanding anything.",
      "Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings.",
      "And immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire.",
      "Another bird did not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog.",
      "When Levin turned towards it, it was already some way off.",
      "But his shot caught it.",
      "Flying twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and whirling round like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.",
      "Come, this is going to be some good!",
      "thought Levin, packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag.",
      "Eh, Laska, will it be good?",
      "When Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen, though unseen behind the storm-clouds.",
      "The moon had lost all of its luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky.",
      "Not a single star could be seen.",
      "The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold.",
      "The stagnant pools were all like amber.",
      "The blue of the grass had changed to yellow-green.",
      "The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook and upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows.",
      "A hawk woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh.",
      "Crows were flying about the field, and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man, who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair.",
      "The smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.",
      "One of the boys ran up to Levin.",
      "Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!",
      "he shouted to him, and he walked a little way off behind him.",
      "And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his approval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.",
      "Chapter 13 The sportsman s saying, that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.",
      "At ten o clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of twenty miles, returned to his night s lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go into the game bag.",
      "His companions had long been awake, and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast.",
      "Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen, said Levin, counting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much less important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked aside, than they did when they were flying.",
      "The number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch s envy pleased Levin.",
      "He was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a note was already there.",
      "I am perfectly well and happy.",
      "If you were uneasy about me, you can feel easier than ever.",
      "I ve a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna, this was the midwife, a new and important personage in Levin s domestic life.",
      "She has come to have a look at me.",
      "She found me perfectly well, and we have kept her till you are back.",
      "All are happy and well, and please, don t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay another day.",
      "These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife, were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over Levin.",
      "One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out of sorts.",
      "The coachman said he was Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "Yes, indeed!",
      "driven ten miles with no sense!",
      "The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his good humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find that of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left.",
      "On his way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct a vision of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told Philip to give him some.",
      "It appeared that there were no pies left, nor even any chicken.",
      "Well, this fellow s appetite!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and pointing at Vassenka Veslovsky.",
      "I never suffer from loss of appetite, but he s really marvelous!...",
      "Well, it can t be helped, said Levin, looking gloomily at Veslovsky.",
      "Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.",
      "The beef s been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs, answered Philip.",
      "Levin was so hurt that he said, in a tone of vexation, You might have left me something!",
      "and he felt ready to cry.",
      "Then put away the game, he said in a shaking voice to Philip, trying not to look at Vassenka, and cover them with some nettles.",
      "And you might at least ask for some milk for me.",
      "But when he had drunk some milk, he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger, and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification.",
      "In the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several successful shots, and in the night they drove home.",
      "Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.",
      "Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants, who had regaled him with vodka, and said to him, Excuse our homely ways, and his night s adventures with kiss-in-the-ring and the servant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him was he married, and on learning that he was not, said to him, Well, mind you don t run after other men s wives you d better get one of your own.",
      "These words had particularly amused Veslovsky.",
      "Altogether, I ve enjoyed our outing awfully.",
      "And you, Levin?",
      "I have, very much, Levin said quite sincerely.",
      "It was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling towards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him.",
      "Chapter 14 Next day at ten o clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds, knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.",
      "_Entrez!_ Veslovsky called to him.",
      "Excuse me, I ve only just finished my ablutions, he said, smiling, standing before him in his underclothes only.",
      "Don t mind me, please.",
      "Levin sat down in the window.",
      "Have you slept well?",
      "Like the dead.",
      "What sort of day is it for shooting?",
      "What will you take, tea or coffee?",
      "Neither.",
      "I ll wait till lunch.",
      "I m really ashamed.",
      "I suppose the ladies are down?",
      "A walk now would be capital.",
      "You show me your horses.",
      "After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned to the house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing-room.",
      "We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!",
      "said Veslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar.",
      "What a pity ladies are cut off from these delights!",
      "Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house, Levin said to himself.",
      "Again he fancied something in the smile, in the all-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty....",
      "The princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya Vlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her side, and began to talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty s confinement, and getting ready rooms for them.",
      "Just as Levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of the event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their fingers.",
      "He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles of linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance.",
      "The birth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised him, but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it seemed presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so immense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so mysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that did happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating.",
      "But the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference, and so she gave him no peace.",
      "She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch to look at a flat, and now she called Levin up.",
      "I know nothing about it, princess.",
      "Do as you think fit, he said.",
      "You must decide when you will move.",
      "I know millions of children are born away from Moscow, and doctors ... why....",
      "But if so.... Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.",
      "We can t talk to Kitty about it!",
      "Do you want me to frighten her?",
      "Why, this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.",
      "I will do just what you say, he said gloomily.",
      "The princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her.",
      "Though the conversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at the samovar.",
      "No, it s impossible, he thought, glancing now and then at Vassenka bending over Kitty, telling her something with his charming smile, and at her, flushed and disturbed.",
      "There was something not nice in Vassenka s attitude, in his eyes, in his smile.",
      "Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty s attitude and look.",
      "And again the light died away in his eyes.",
      "Again, as before, all of a sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a pinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair, rage, and humiliation.",
      "Again everything and everyone had become hateful to him.",
      "You do just as you think best, princess, he said again, looking round.",
      "Heavy is the cap of Monomach, Stepan Arkadyevitch said playfully, hinting, evidently, not simply at the princess s conversation, but at the cause of Levin s agitation, which he had noticed.",
      "How late you are today, Dolly!",
      "Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Vassenka only rose for an instant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the modern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation again, laughing at something.",
      "I ve been worried about Masha.",
      "She did not sleep well, and is dreadfully tiresome today, said Dolly.",
      "The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the same lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether love is to be put higher than worldly considerations.",
      "Kitty disliked the conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the tone in which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect it would have on her husband.",
      "But she was too simple and innocent to know how to cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the superficial pleasure afforded her by the young man s very obvious admiration.",
      "She wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do.",
      "Whatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband, and the worst interpretation put on it.",
      "And, in fact, when she asked Dolly what was wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting conversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the question struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of hypocrisy.",
      "What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?",
      "By all means, please, and I shall come too, said Kitty, and she blushed.",
      "She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he would come, and she did not ask him.",
      "Where are you going, Kostya?",
      "she asked her husband with a guilty face, as he passed by her with a resolute step.",
      "This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.",
      "The mechanician came when I was away; I haven t seen him yet, he said, not looking at her.",
      "He went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard his wife s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him.",
      "he said to her shortly.",
      "We are busy.",
      "I beg your pardon, she said to the German mechanician; I want a few words with my husband.",
      "The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him: Don t disturb yourself.",
      "The train is at three?",
      "queried the German.",
      "I mustn t be late.",
      "Levin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.",
      "Well, what have you to say to me?",
      "he said to her in French.",
      "He did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in her condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.",
      "I want to say that we can t go on like this; that this is misery.... she said.",
      "The servants are here at the sideboard, he said angrily; don t make a scene.",
      "Well, let s go in here!",
      "They were standing in the passage.",
      "Kitty would have gone into the next room, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.",
      "Well, come into the garden.",
      "In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path.",
      "And no longer considering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his agitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster, they went on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and clear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of the misery they were both feeling.",
      "We can t go on like this!",
      "It s misery!",
      "I am wretched; you are wretched.",
      "she said, when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.",
      "But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, not nice, humiliatingly horrible?",
      "he said, standing before her again in the same position with his clenched fists on his chest, as he had stood before her that night.",
      "Yes, she said in a shaking voice; but, Kostya, surely you see I m not to blame?",
      "All the morning I ve been trying to take a tone ... but such people.... Why did he come?",
      "How happy we were!",
      "she said, breathless with the sobs that shook her.",
      "Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run away from, and they could not possibly have found anything very delightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that they passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.",
      "Chapter 15 After escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly s part of the house.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too that day.",
      "She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl, who stood in the corner roaring.",
      "And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won t make you a new frock, she said, not knowing how to punish her.",
      "Oh, she is a disgusting child!",
      "she turned to Levin.",
      "Where does she get such wicked propensities?",
      "Why, what has she done?",
      "Levin said without much interest, for he had wanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at an unlucky moment.",
      "Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ...",
      "I can t tell you really what she did.",
      "It s a thousand pities Miss Elliot s not with us.",
      "This one sees to nothing she s a machine.... _Figurez-vous que la petite_?...",
      "And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha s crime.",
      "That proves nothing; it s not a question of evil propensities at all, it s simply mischief, Levin assured her.",
      "But you are upset about something?",
      "What have you come for?",
      "asked Dolly.",
      "What s going on there?",
      "And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for him to say what he had meant to say.",
      "I ve not been in there, I ve been alone in the garden with Kitty.",
      "We ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.",
      "Dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.",
      "Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but in that gentleman s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant not unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?",
      "You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!",
      "she said to Masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother s face, had been turning round.",
      "The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as young men do behave.",
      "_Il fait la cour une jeune et jolie femme_, and a husband who s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.",
      "Yes, yes, said Levin gloomily; but you noticed it?",
      "Not only I, but Stiva noticed it.",
      "Just after breakfast he said to me in so many words, _Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour Kitty_.",
      "Well, that s all right then; now I m satisfied.",
      "I ll send him away, said Levin.",
      "What do you mean!",
      "Are you crazy?",
      "Dolly cried in horror; nonsense, Kostya, only think!",
      "she said, laughing.",
      "You can go now to Fanny, she said to Masha.",
      "No, if you wish it, I ll speak to Stiva.",
      "He ll take him away.",
      "He can say you re expecting visitors.",
      "Altogether he doesn t fit into the house.",
      "No, no, I ll do it myself.",
      "But you ll quarrel with him?",
      "I shall so enjoy it, Levin said, his eyes flashing with real enjoyment.",
      "Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won t do it again, he said of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing irresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her brows to catch her mother s eye.",
      "The mother glanced at her.",
      "The child broke into sobs, hid her face on her mother s lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.",
      "And what is there in common between us and him?",
      "thought Levin, and he went off to look for Veslovsky.",
      "As he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be got ready to drive to the station.",
      "The spring was broken yesterday, said the footman.",
      "Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste.",
      "Where s the visitor?",
      "The gentleman s gone to his room.",
      "Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having unpacked his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was putting on his gaiters to go out riding.",
      "Whether there was something exceptional in Levin s face, or that Vassenka was himself conscious that _ce petit brin de cour_ he was making was out of place in this family, but he was somewhat (as much as a young man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin s entrance.",
      "You ride in gaiters?",
      "Yes, it s much cleaner, said Vassenka, putting his fat leg on a chair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good humor.",
      "He was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on Vassenka s face.",
      "On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that morning, trying their strength.",
      "Levin took the fragment in his hands and began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how to begin.",
      "I wanted....",
      "He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and everything that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the face: I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.",
      "Vassenka began in surprise.",
      "To drive where?",
      "For you to drive to the station, Levin said gloomily.",
      "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
      "It happens that I expect visitors, said Levin, his strong fingers more and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick.",
      "And I m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to go away.",
      "You can explain my rudeness as you like.",
      "Vassenka drew himself up.",
      "I beg you to explain.... he said with dignity, understanding at last.",
      "I can t explain, Levin said softly and deliberately, trying to control the trembling of his jaw; and you d better not ask.",
      "And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick ends in his finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the end as it fell.",
      "Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had proved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft voice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words.",
      "He bowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.",
      "Can I not see Oblonsky?",
      "The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.",
      "What else was there for him to do?",
      "I ll send him to you at once.",
      "What madness is this?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after hearing from his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he found Levin in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his guest s departure.",
      "_Mais c est ridicule!_ What fly has stung you?",
      "_Mais c est du dernier ridicule!_ What did you think, if a young man....",
      "But the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for he turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on the reason, and he himself cut him short.",
      "Please don t go into it!",
      "I feel ashamed of how I m treating you and him.",
      "But it won t be, I imagine, a great grief to him to go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.",
      "But it s insulting to him!",
      "_Et puis c est ridicule_.",
      "And to me it s both insulting and distressing!",
      "And I m not at fault in any way, and there s no need for me to suffer.",
      "Well, this I didn t expect of you!",
      "_On peut tre jaloux, mais ce point, c est du dernier ridicule!_ Levin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths of the avenue, and he went on walking up and down alone.",
      "Soon he heard the rumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting in the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his Scotch cap, was driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.",
      "Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house and stopped the trap.",
      "It was the mechanician, whom Levin had totally forgotten.",
      "The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky, then clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin s action.",
      "And he himself felt not only in the highest degree _ridicule_, but also utterly guilty and disgraced.",
      "But remembering what sufferings he and his wife had been through, when he asked himself how he should act another time, he answered that he should do just the same again.",
      "In spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the princess, who could not pardon Levin s action, became extraordinarily lively and good-humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up people after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening Vassenka s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as though it were some remote event.",
      "And Dolly, who had inherited her father s gift of humorous storytelling, made Varenka helpless with laughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with fresh humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing-room, heard suddenly the rumble of the trap.",
      "And who should be in the trap but Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his gaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.",
      "If only you d ordered out the carriage!",
      "But no!",
      "and then I hear: Stop!",
      "Oh, I thought they ve relented.",
      "I look out, and behold a fat German being sat down by him and driving away.... And my new shoes all for nothing!...",
      "Chapter 16 Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna.",
      "She was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked.",
      "She quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with Vronsky.",
      "But she felt she must go and see Anna, and show her that her feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change in her position.",
      "That she might be independent of the Levins in this expedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.",
      "What makes you suppose that I dislike your going?",
      "But, even if I did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses, he said.",
      "You never told me that you were going for certain.",
      "Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what s of more importance, they ll undertake the job and never get you there.",
      "I have horses.",
      "And if you don t want to wound me, you ll take mine.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them together from the farm and saddle-horses not at all a smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day.",
      "At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house.",
      "Moreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna s pecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were taken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin s advice, started before daybreak.",
      "The road was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along merrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house clerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.",
      "After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant s with whom Levin had stayed on the way to Sviazhsky s, and chatting with the women about their children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o clock, went on again.",
      "At home, looking after her children, she had no time to think.",
      "So now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over all her life as she never had before, and from the most different points of view.",
      "Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself.",
      "At first she thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy, although the princess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look after them.",
      "If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha isn t kicked by a horse, and Lily s stomach isn t upset again!",
      "But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions of the immediate future.",
      "She began thinking how she had to get a new flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak.",
      "Then questions of the more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children in the world.",
      "The girls are all right, she thought; but the boys?",
      "It s very well that I m teaching Grisha, but of course that s only because I am free myself now, I m not with child.",
      "Stiva, of course, there s no counting on.",
      "And with the help of good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there s another baby coming?...",
      "And the thought struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children.",
      "The birth itself, that s nothing; but the months of carrying the child that s what s so intolerable, she thought, picturing to herself her last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby.",
      "And she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn.",
      "On being asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully: I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.",
      "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
      "asked Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Why grieve?",
      "The old man has grandchildren enough as it is.",
      "It was only a trouble.",
      "No working, nor nothing.",
      "Only a tie.",
      "This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could not help recalling these words.",
      "In those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth.",
      "Yes, altogether, thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life, pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything, and most of all hideousness.",
      "Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I m with child become hideous, I know it.",
      "The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment ... then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains.... Darya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from sore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child.",
      "Then the children s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them up; evil propensities (she thought of little Masha s crime among the raspberries), education, Latin it s all so incomprehensible and difficult.",
      "And on the top of it all, the death of these children.",
      "And there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always tore her mother s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had died of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.",
      "And all this, what s it for?",
      "What is to come of it all?",
      "That I m wasting my life, never having a moment s peace, either with child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.",
      "Even now, if it weren t for spending the summer at the Levins , I don t know how we should be managing to live.",
      "Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we don t feel it; but it can t go on.",
      "They ll have children, they won t be able to keep us; it s a drag on them as it is.",
      "How is papa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us?",
      "So that I can t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other people, at the cost of humiliation.",
      "Why, even if we suppose the greatest good luck, that the children don t die, and I bring them up somehow.",
      "At the very best they ll simply be decent people.",
      "That s all I can hope for.",
      "And to gain simply that what agonies, what toil!...",
      "One s whole life ruined!",
      "Again she recalled what the young peasant woman had said, and again she was revolted at the thought; but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words.",
      "Is it far now, Mihail?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna asked the counting-house clerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her.",
      "From this village, they say, it s five miles.",
      "The carriage drove along the village street and onto a bridge.",
      "On the bridge was a crowd of peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders, gaily and noisily chattering.",
      "They stood still on the bridge, staring inquisitively at the carriage.",
      "All the faces turned to Darya Alexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of their enjoyment of life.",
      "They re all living, they re all enjoying life, Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant women and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the soft springs of the old carriage, while I, let out, as it were from prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only looking about me now for an instant.",
      "They all live; those peasant women and my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see all, but not I.",
      "And they attack Anna.",
      "am I any better?",
      "I have, anyway, a husband I love not as I should like to love him, still I do love him, while Anna never loved hers.",
      "How is she to blame?",
      "She wants to live.",
      "God has put that in our hearts.",
      "Very likely I should have done the same.",
      "Even to this day I don t feel sure I did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow.",
      "I ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh.",
      "I might have loved and have been loved in reality.",
      "And is it any better as it is?",
      "I don t respect him.",
      "He s necessary to me, she thought about her husband, and I put up with him.",
      "Is that any better?",
      "At that time I could still have been admired, I had beauty left me still, Darya Alexandrovna pursued her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at herself in the looking-glass.",
      "She had a traveling looking-glass in her handbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying counting-house clerk, she felt that she would be ashamed if either of them were to look round, and she did not take out the glass.",
      "But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always particularly attentive to her, of Stiva s good-hearted friend, Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina, and was in love with her.",
      "And there was someone else, a quite young man, who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters.",
      "And the most passionate and impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna s imagination.",
      "Anna did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it.",
      "She is happy, she makes another person happy, and she s not broken down as I am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to every impression, thought Darya Alexandrovna, and a sly smile curved her lips, for, as she pondered on Anna s love affair, Darya Alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in love with her.",
      "She, like Anna, confessed the whole affair to her husband.",
      "And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at this avowal made her smile.",
      "In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to Vozdvizhenskoe.",
      "Chapter 17 The coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right, to a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart.",
      "The counting-house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second thoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned to them to come up.",
      "The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove, dropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming horses that angrily shook them off.",
      "The metallic clank of a whetstone against a scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased.",
      "One of the peasants got up and came towards the carriage.",
      "Well, you are slow!",
      "the counting-house clerk shouted angrily to the peasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the rough dry road.",
      "Come along, do!",
      "A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his bent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening his steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand.",
      "Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house?",
      "the count s?",
      "he repeated; go on to the end of this track.",
      "Then turn to the left.",
      "Straight along the avenue and you ll come right upon it.",
      "But whom do you want?",
      "The count himself?",
      "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely, not knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.",
      "At home for sure, said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to the other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the dust.",
      "Sure to be at home, he repeated, evidently eager to talk.",
      "Only yesterday visitors arrived.",
      "There s a sight of visitors come.",
      "He turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting something to him from the cart.",
      "They all rode by here not long since, to look at a reaping machine.",
      "They ll be home by now.",
      "And who will you be belonging to?...",
      "We ve come a long way, said the coachman, climbing onto the box.",
      "So it s not far?",
      "I tell you, it s just here.",
      "As soon as you get out.... he said, keeping hold all the while of the carriage.",
      "A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.",
      "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
      "I don t know, my boy.",
      "So you keep to the left, and you ll come right on it, said the peasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to converse.",
      "The coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off when the peasant shouted: Stop!",
      "Hi, friend!",
      "called the two voices.",
      "The coachman stopped.",
      "They re coming!",
      "They re yonder!",
      "shouted the peasant.",
      "See what a turn-out!",
      "he said, pointing to four persons on horseback, and two in a _char- -banc_, coming along the road.",
      "They were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and Princess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the _char- -banc_.",
      "They had gone out to look at the working of a new reaping machine.",
      "When the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a walking pace.",
      "Anna was in front beside Veslovsky.",
      "Anna, quietly walking her horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat, her full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and all the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly.",
      "For the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on horseback.",
      "The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in Darya Alexandrovna s mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation and frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in Anna s position.",
      "But when she had scrutinized her, seeing her closer, she was at once reconciled to her riding.",
      "In spite of her elegance, everything was so simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the movements of Anna, that nothing could have been more natural.",
      "Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka Veslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs stretched out in front, obviously pleased with his own appearance.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she recognized him.",
      "Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously heated from galloping.",
      "He was holding her in, pulling at the reins.",
      "After him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey.",
      "Sviazhsky and Princess Varvara in a new _char- -banc_ with a big, raven-black trotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.",
      "Anna s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in the little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she recognized Dolly.",
      "She uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her horse into a gallop.",
      "On reaching the carriage she jumped off without assistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly.",
      "I thought it was you and dared not think it.",
      "You can t fancy how glad I am!",
      "she said, at one moment pressing her face against Dolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off and examining her with a smile.",
      "Here s a delightful surprise, Alexey!",
      "she said, looking round at Vronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.",
      "Vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.",
      "You wouldn t believe how glad we are to see you, he said, giving peculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth in a smile.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and greeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.",
      "That s Princess Varvara, Anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry from Dolly as the _char- -banc_ drove up.",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face betrayed her dissatisfaction.",
      "Princess Varvara was her husband s aunt, and she had long known her, and did not respect her.",
      "She knew that Princess Varvara had passed her whole life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now be sponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified Dolly on account of her kinship with her husband.",
      "Anna noticed Dolly s expression, and was disconcerted by it.",
      "She blushed, dropped her riding habit, and stumbled over it.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna went up to the _char- -banc_ and coldly greeted Princess Varvara.",
      "Sviazhsky too she knew.",
      "He inquired how his queer friend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the ill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards, proposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char- -banc_.",
      "And I ll get into this vehicle, he said.",
      "The horse is quiet, and the princess drives capitally.",
      "No, stay as you were, said Anna, coming up, and we ll go in the carriage, and taking Dolly s arm, she drew her away.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage of a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the elegant and gorgeous people surrounding her.",
      "But what struck her most of all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she knew so well and loved.",
      "Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing Anna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been thinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.",
      "But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found in women during the moments of love, and which she saw now in Anna s face.",
      "Everything in her face, the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks and chin, the line of her lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered about her face, the brilliance of her eyes, the grace and rapidity of her movements, the fulness of the notes of her voice, even the manner in which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she answered Veslovsky when he asked permission to get on her cob, so as to teach it to gallop with the right leg foremost it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it seemed as if she were herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.",
      "When both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment came over both of them.",
      "Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of inquiry Dolly fixed upon her.",
      "Dolly was embarrassed because after Sviazhsky s phrase about this vehicle, she could not help feeling ashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her.",
      "The coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were experiencing the same sensation.",
      "The counting-house clerk, to conceal his confusion, busied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the coachman became sullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this external superiority.",
      "He smiled ironically, looking at the raven horse, and was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the _char- -banc_ was only good for _promenage_, and wouldn t do thirty miles straight off in the heat.",
      "The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and mirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments on it.",
      "They re pleased, too; haven t seen each other for a long while, said the curly-headed old man with the bast round his hair.",
      "I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart the corn, that ud be quick work!",
      "Look-ee!",
      "Is that a woman in breeches?",
      "said one of them, pointing to Vassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.",
      "Nay, a man!",
      "See how smartly he s going it!",
      "Eh, lads!",
      "seems we re not going to sleep, then?",
      "What chance of sleep today!",
      "said the old man, with a sidelong look at the sun.",
      "Midday s past, look-ee!",
      "Get your hooks, and come along!",
      "Chapter 18 Anna looked at Dolly s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner.",
      "But, conscious that she herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly s eyes were telling her so, she sighed and began to speak about herself.",
      "You are looking at me, she said, and wondering how I can be happy in my position?",
      "it s shameful to confess, but I ...",
      "I m inexcusably happy.",
      "Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you re frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the horrors are no more.",
      "I have waked up.",
      "I have lived through the misery, the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we ve been here, I ve been so happy!...",
      "she said, with a timid smile of inquiry looking at Dolly.",
      "said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly than she wanted to.",
      "I m very glad for you.",
      "Why haven t you written to me?",
      "Why?...",
      "Because I hadn t the courage.... You forget my position.... To me?",
      "Hadn t the courage?",
      "If you knew how I ...",
      "I look at.... Darya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but for some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.",
      "But of that we ll talk later.",
      "What s this, what are all these buildings?",
      "she asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac.",
      "Quite a little town.",
      "But Anna did not answer.",
      "How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?",
      "I consider.... Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that instant Vassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg foremost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down in his short jacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle.",
      "He s doing it, Anna Arkadyevna!",
      "Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya Alexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the carriage, and so she cut short her thought.",
      "I don t think anything, she said, but I always loved you, and if one loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as one would like them to be.... Anna, taking her eyes off her friend s face and dropping her eyelids (this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before), pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words.",
      "And obviously interpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at Dolly.",
      "If you had any sins, she said, they would all be forgiven you for your coming to see me and these words.",
      "And Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes.",
      "She pressed Anna s hand in silence.",
      "Well, what are these buildings?",
      "How many there are of them!",
      "After a moment s silence she repeated her question.",
      "These are the servants houses, barns, and stables, answered Anna.",
      "And there the park begins.",
      "It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had everything renewed.",
      "He is very fond of this place, and, what I never expected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it.",
      "But his is such a rich nature!",
      "Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly.",
      "So far from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest.",
      "He with his temperament as I know it he has become careful and businesslike, a first-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management of the land.",
      "But only in that.",
      "When it s a question of tens of thousands, he doesn t think of money.",
      "She spoke with that gleefully sly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics only known to them of those they love.",
      "Do you see that big building?",
      "that s the new hospital.",
      "I believe it will cost over a hundred thousand; that s his hobby just now.",
      "And do you know how it all came about?",
      "The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly.",
      "Of course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about money.",
      "_C est une petitesse_, if you like, but I love him all the more for it.",
      "And now you ll see the house in a moment.",
      "It was his grandfather s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.",
      "How beautiful!",
      "said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the handsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored greens of the old trees in the garden.",
      "Isn t it fine?",
      "And from the house, from the top, the view is wonderful.",
      "They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers, in which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round the light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.",
      "Ah, they re here already!",
      "said Anna, looking at the saddle horses, which were just being led away from the steps.",
      "It is a nice horse, isn t it?",
      "It s my cob; my favorite.",
      "Lead him here and bring me some sugar.",
      "Where is the count?",
      "she inquired of two smart footmen who darted out.",
      "Ah, there he is!",
      "she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet her with Veslovsky.",
      "Where are you going to put the princess?",
      "said Vronsky in French, addressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted Darya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand.",
      "I think the big balcony room.",
      "Oh, no, that s too far off!",
      "Better in the corner room, we shall see each other more.",
      "Come, let s go up, said Anna, as she gave her favorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.",
      "_Et vous oubliez votre devoir_, she said to Veslovsky, who came out too on the steps.",
      "_Pardon, j en ai tout plein les poches_, he answered, smiling, putting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.",
      "_Mais vous venez trop tard_, she said, rubbing her handkerchief on her hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.",
      "Anna turned to Dolly.",
      "You can stay some time?",
      "For one day only?",
      "That s impossible!",
      "I promised to be back, and the children.... said Dolly, feeling embarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage, and because she knew her face must be covered with dust.",
      "No, Dolly, darling!...",
      "Well, we ll see.",
      "Come along, come along!",
      "and Anna led Dolly to her room.",
      "That room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but the one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it.",
      "And this room, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels abroad.",
      "Well, darling, how happy I am!",
      "Anna said, sitting down in her riding habit for a moment beside Dolly.",
      "Tell me about all of you.",
      "Stiva I had only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children.",
      "How is my favorite, Tanya?",
      "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
      "Yes, she s very tall, Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised herself that she should respond so coolly about her children.",
      "We are having a delightful stay at the Levins , she added.",
      "Oh, if I had known, said Anna, that you do not despise me!...",
      "You might have all come to us.",
      "Stiva s an old friend and a great friend of Alexey s, you know, she added, and suddenly she blushed.",
      "Yes, but we are all.... Dolly answered in confusion.",
      "But in my delight I m talking nonsense.",
      "The one thing, darling, is that I am so glad to have you!",
      "said Anna, kissing her again.",
      "You haven t told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting to know.",
      "But I m glad you will see me as I am.",
      "The chief thing I shouldn t like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.",
      "I don t want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one harm but myself.",
      "I have the right to do that, haven t I?",
      "But it is a big subject, and we ll talk over everything properly later.",
      "Now I ll go and dress and send a maid to you.",
      "Chapter 19 Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife s eye, scanned her room.",
      "All she had seen in entering the house and walking through it, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of wealth and sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she had only read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the country.",
      "Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor.",
      "The bed had a spring mattress, and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the little pillows.",
      "The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little sofa, the tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window curtains, and the _porti res_ were all new and expensive.",
      "The smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done up high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly s, was as new and expensive as the whole room.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness, her deferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her.",
      "She felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had unluckily been packed by mistake for her.",
      "She was ashamed of the very patches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home.",
      "At home it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be needed twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which was a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making, and these thirty shillings had been saved.",
      "But before the maid she felt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she had known for years, walked in.",
      "The smart maid was sent for to go to her mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady s arrival, and began to chatter away without a pause.",
      "Dolly observed that she was longing to express her opinion in regard to her mistress s position, especially as to the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly carefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.",
      "I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady s dearer to me than anything.",
      "Well, it s not for us to judge.",
      "And, to be sure, there seems so much love.... Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please, Darya Alexandrovna cut her short.",
      "Certainly.",
      "We ve two women kept specially for washing small things, but most of the linen s done by machinery.",
      "The count goes into everything himself.",
      "Ah, what a husband!...",
      "Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to Annushka s gossip.",
      "Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown.",
      "Dolly scrutinized that simple gown attentively.",
      "She knew what it meant, and the price at which such simplicity was obtained.",
      "An old friend, said Anna of Annushka.",
      "Anna was not embarrassed now.",
      "She was perfectly composed and at ease.",
      "Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her arrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless tone which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which her deeper feelings and ideas were kept.",
      "Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?",
      "Annie?",
      "(This was what she called her little daughter Anna.)",
      "She has got on wonderfully.",
      "Would you like to see her?",
      "Come, I ll show her to you.",
      "We had a terrible bother, she began telling her, over nurses.",
      "We had an Italian wet-nurse.",
      "A good creature, but so stupid!",
      "We wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her that we ve gone on keeping her still.",
      "But how have you managed?...",
      "Dolly was beginning a question as to what name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on Anna s face, she changed the drift of her question.",
      "How did you manage?",
      "have you weaned her yet?",
      "But Anna had understood.",
      "You didn t mean to ask that?",
      "You meant to ask about her surname.",
      "That worries Alexey.",
      "She has no name that is, she s a Karenina, said Anna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes meeting.",
      "But we ll talk about all that later, her face suddenly brightening.",
      "Come, I ll show you her.",
      "_Elle est tr s gentille_.",
      "She crawls now.",
      "In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house struck her still more.",
      "There were little go-carts ordered from England, and appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a billiard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and baths, all of special pattern, and modern.",
      "They were all English, solid, and of good make, and obviously very expensive.",
      "The room was large, and very light and lofty.",
      "When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was sitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her dinner of broth, which she was spilling all over her little chest.",
      "The baby was being fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal.",
      "Neither the wet-nurse nor the head-nurse were there; they were in the next room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer French which was their only means of communication.",
      "Hearing Anna s voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a disagreeable face and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly shaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself though Anna had not found fault with her.",
      "At every word Anna said, the English nurse said hurriedly several times, Yes, my lady.",
      "The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger.",
      "She positively envied the baby s healthy appearance.",
      "She was delighted, too, at the baby s crawling.",
      "Not one of her own children had crawled like that.",
      "When the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress tucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming.",
      "Looking round like some little wild animal at the grown-up big people with her bright black eyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her, and holding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms, and rapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step forward with her little arms.",
      "But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English nurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all.",
      "It was only on the supposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a household as Anna s that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to herself how Anna with her insight into people could take such an unprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her child.",
      "Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at once that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence, and that the mother s visit was something exceptional.",
      "Anna wanted to get the baby her plaything, and could not find it.",
      "Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the baby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last teeth.",
      "I sometimes feel sorry I m so superfluous here, said Anna, going out of the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything standing in the doorway.",
      "It was very different with my first child.",
      "I expected it to be the other way, said Darya Alexandrovna shyly.",
      "By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?",
      "said Anna, screwing up her eyes, as though looking at something far away.",
      "But we ll talk about that later.",
      "You wouldn t believe it, I m like a hungry beggar woman when a full dinner is set before her, and she does not know what to begin on first.",
      "The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me with you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don t know which subject to begin upon first.",
      "_Mais je ne vous ferai gr ce de rien_.",
      "I must have everything out with you.",
      "Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us, she went on.",
      "I ll begin with the ladies.",
      "Princess Varvara you know her, and I know your opinion and Stiva s about her.",
      "Stiva says the whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie Katerina Pavlovna: that s all true; but she s a good-natured woman, and I am so grateful to her.",
      "In Petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was absolutely essential for me.",
      "Then she turned up.",
      "But really she is good-natured.",
      "She did a great deal to alleviate my position.",
      "I see you don t understand all the difficulty of my position ... there in Petersburg, she added.",
      "Here I m perfectly at ease and happy.",
      "Well, of that later on, though.",
      "Then Sviazhsky he s the marshal of the district, and he s a very good sort of a man, but he wants to get something out of Alexey.",
      "You understand, with his property, now that we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great influence.",
      "Then there s Tushkevitch you have seen him, you know Betsy s admirer.",
      "Now he s been thrown over and he s come to see us.",
      "As Alexey says, he s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts them for what they try to appear to be, _et puis il est comme il faut_, as Princess Varvara says.",
      "Then Veslovsky ... you know him.",
      "A very nice boy, she said, and a sly smile curved her lips.",
      "What s this wild story about him and the Levins?",
      "Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we don t believe it.",
      "_Il est tr s gentil et na f_, she said again with the same smile.",
      "Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I value all these people.",
      "We have to have the house lively and gay, so that Alexey may not long for any novelty.",
      "Then you ll see the steward a German, a very good fellow, and he understands his work.",
      "Alexey has a very high opinion of him.",
      "Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor.",
      "Then the architect.... _Une petite cour!_ Chapter 20 Here s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her, said Anna, coming out with Darya Alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where Princess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame, working at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch s easy chair.",
      "She says she doesn t want anything before dinner, but please order some lunch for her, and I ll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.",
      "Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception, and began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna because she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina Pavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when everyone had abandoned Anna, she thought it her duty to help her in this most difficult period of transition.",
      "Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my solitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however difficult it may be for me not like some other people.",
      "And how sweet it is of you, how right of you to have come!",
      "They live like the best of married couples; it s for God to judge them, not for us.",
      "And didn t Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev and Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say anything about them?",
      "And it has ended by their being received by everyone.",
      "And then, _c est un int rieur si joli, si comme il faut.",
      "Tout- -fait l anglaise.",
      "On se r unit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se s pare._ Everyone does as he pleases till dinner time.",
      "Dinner at seven o clock.",
      "Stiva did very rightly to send you.",
      "He needs their support.",
      "You know that through his mother and brother he can do anything.",
      "And then they do so much good.",
      "He didn t tell you about his hospital?",
      "_Ce sera admirable_ everything from Paris.",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of the party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace.",
      "There was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite weather, and so several different methods of spending the next two hours were proposed.",
      "There were very many methods of passing the time at Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at Pokrovskoe.",
      "_Une partie de lawn-tennis,_ Veslovsky proposed, with his handsome smile.",
      "We ll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "No, it s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the boat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.",
      "Vronsky proposed.",
      "I agree to anything, said Sviazhsky.",
      "I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll wouldn t you?",
      "And then the boat, perhaps, said Anna.",
      "So it was decided.",
      "Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing place, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.",
      "They walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and Dolly with Vronsky.",
      "Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the new surroundings in which she found herself.",
      "Abstractly, theoretically, she did not merely justify, she positively approved of Anna s conduct.",
      "As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary of the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only excused illicit love, she positively envied it.",
      "Besides, she loved Anna with all her heart.",
      "But seeing Anna in actual life among these strangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya Alexandrovna, she felt ill at ease.",
      "What she disliked particularly was seeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed.",
      "As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna s action; but to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was disagreeable to her.",
      "Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky.",
      "She thought him very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud except his wealth.",
      "But against her own will, here in his own house, he overawed her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him.",
      "She felt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her dressing jacket.",
      "Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly ashamed, but embarrassed at herself.",
      "Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.",
      "Even though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house and garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the same tell him how much she liked his house.",
      "Yes, it s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style, he said.",
      "I like so much the court in front of the steps.",
      "Was that always so?",
      "he said, and his face beamed with pleasure.",
      "If you could only have seen that court last spring!",
      "And he began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried away by the subject as he went on, to draw her attention to the various details of the decoration of his house and garden.",
      "It was evident that, having devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his home, Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person, and was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna s praise.",
      "If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed, it s not far.",
      "Shall we go?",
      "he said, glancing into her face to convince himself that she was not bored.",
      "Are you coming, Anna?",
      "he turned to her.",
      "We will come, won t we?",
      "she said, addressing Sviazhsky.",
      "_Mais il ne faut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre l dans le bateau._ We must send and tell them.",
      "Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here, said Anna, turning to Dolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had previously talked about the hospital.",
      "Oh, it s a work of real importance!",
      "But to show he was not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he promptly added some slightly critical remarks.",
      "I wonder, though, count, he said, that while you do so much for the health of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.",
      "_C est devenu tellement commun les coles,_ said Vronsky.",
      "You understand it s not on that account, but it just happens so, my interest has been diverted elsewhere.",
      "This way then to the hospital, he said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to a turning out of the avenue.",
      "The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path.",
      "After going down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large pretentious-looking red building, almost finished.",
      "The iron roof, which was not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.",
      "Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by scaffolding.",
      "Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying bricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.",
      "How quickly work gets done with you!",
      "When I was here last time the roof was not on.",
      "By the autumn it will all be ready.",
      "Inside almost everything is done, said Anna.",
      "And what s this new building?",
      "That s the house for the doctor and the dispensary, answered Vronsky, seeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing himself to the ladies, he went to meet him.",
      "Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still with the architect and began talking rather warmly.",
      "The front is still too low, he said to Anna, who had asked what was the matter.",
      "I said the foundation ought to be raised, said Anna.",
      "Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna, said the architect, but now it s too late.",
      "Yes, I take a great interest in it, Anna answered Sviazhsky, who was expressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture.",
      "This new building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital.",
      "It was an afterthought, and was begun without a plan.",
      "Vronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the ladies, and led them inside the hospital.",
      "Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were painting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.",
      "Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they walked into the first large room.",
      "The walls were stuccoed to look like marble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet floor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a block of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their hair, to greet the gentry.",
      "This is the reception room, said Vronsky.",
      "Here there will be a desk, tables, and benches, and nothing more.",
      "This way; let us go in here.",
      "Don t go near the window, said Anna, trying the paint to see if it were dry.",
      "Alexey, the paint s dry already, she added.",
      "From the reception room they went into the corridor.",
      "Here Vronsky showed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system.",
      "Then he showed them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs.",
      "Then he showed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room, then the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would make no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors, and many other things.",
      "Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest mechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully.",
      "Dolly simply wondered at all she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it all, made minute inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great satisfaction.",
      "Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly fitted hospital in Russia, said Sviazhsky.",
      "And won t you have a lying-in ward?",
      "That s so much needed in the country.",
      "I have often....",
      "In spite of his usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her.",
      "This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is intended for all diseases, except infectious complaints, he said.",
      "look at this, and he rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna an invalid chair that had just been ordered for the convalescents.",
      "Look.",
      "He sat down in the chair and began moving it.",
      "The patient can t walk still too weak, perhaps, or something wrong with his legs, but he must have air, and he moves, rolls himself along.... Darya Alexandrovna was interested by everything.",
      "She liked everything very much, but most of all she liked Vronsky himself with his natural, simple-hearted eagerness.",
      "Yes, he s a very nice, good man, she thought several times, not hearing what he said, but looking at him and penetrating into his expression, while she mentally put herself in Anna s place.",
      "She liked him so much just now with his eager interest that she saw how Anna could be in love with him.",
      "Chapter 21 No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don t interest her, Vronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stables, where Sviazhsky wished to see the new stallion.",
      "You go on, while I escort the princess home, and we ll have a little talk, he said, if you would like that?",
      "he added, turning to her.",
      "I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted, answered Darya Alexandrovna, rather astonished.",
      "She saw by Vronsky s face that he wanted something from her.",
      "She was not mistaken.",
      "As soon as they had passed through the little gate back into the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had taken, and having made sure that she could neither hear nor see them, he began: You guess that I have something I want to say to you, he said, looking at her with laughing eyes.",
      "I am not wrong in believing you to be a friend of Anna s. He took off his hat, and taking out his handkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing bald.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with dismay.",
      "When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her.",
      "The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to her flashed into her brain.",
      "He is going to beg me to come to stay with them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn t it Vassenka Veslovsky and his relations with Anna?",
      "Or perhaps about Kitty, that he feels he was to blame?",
      "All her conjectures were unpleasant, but she did not guess what he really wanted to talk about to her.",
      "You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you, he said; do help me.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face, which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again.",
      "She waited for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her, scratching with his cane in the gravel.",
      "You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna s former friends I don t count Princess Varvara but I know that you have done this not because you regard our position as normal, but because, understanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her and want to be a help to her.",
      "Have I understood you rightly?",
      "he asked, looking round at her.",
      "Oh, yes, answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her sunshade, but.... No, he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position into which he was putting his companion, he stopped abruptly, so that she had to stop short too.",
      "No one feels more deeply and intensely than I do all the difficulty of Anna s position; and that you may well understand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart.",
      "I am to blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.",
      "I understand, said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring the sincerity and firmness with which he said this.",
      "But just because you feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid, she said.",
      "Her position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.",
      "In the world it is hell!",
      "he brought out quickly, frowning darkly.",
      "You can t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through in Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.",
      "Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss society.... Society!",
      "he said contemptuously, how could I miss society?",
      "So far and it may be so always you are happy and at peace.",
      "I see in Anna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had time to tell me so much already, said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; and involuntarily, as she said this, at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether Anna really were happy.",
      "But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.",
      "Yes, yes, he said, I know that she has revived after all her sufferings; she is happy.",
      "She is happy in the present.",
      "But I?...",
      "I am afraid of what is before us ...",
      "I beg your pardon, you would like to walk on?",
      "No, I don t mind.",
      "Well, then, let us sit here.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.",
      "He stood up facing her.",
      "I see that she is happy, he repeated, and the doubt whether she were happy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna s mind.",
      "But can it last?",
      "Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but the die is cast, he said, passing from Russian to French, and we are bound together for life.",
      "We are united by all the ties of love that we hold most sacred.",
      "We have a child, we may have other children.",
      "But the law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.",
      "And that one can well understand.",
      "But I can t help seeing them.",
      "My daughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin s. I cannot bear this falsity!",
      "he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked with gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "She made no answer, but simply gazed at him.",
      "He went on: One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin; he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have, there will be no real tie between us.",
      "They will be Karenins.",
      "You can understand the bitterness and horror of this position!",
      "I have tried to speak of this to Anna.",
      "It irritates her.",
      "She does not understand, and to her I cannot speak plainly of all this.",
      "Now look at another side.",
      "I am happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation.",
      "I have found occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army.",
      "And most certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs.",
      "I am working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented, and we need nothing more to make us happy.",
      "I love my work here.",
      "_Ce n est pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary.... Darya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he grew confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but she felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of which he could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of everything, and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell into the same category of matters near his heart, as the question of his relations with Anna.",
      "Well, I will go on, he said, collecting himself.",
      "The great thing is that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will not die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me, and this I have not.",
      "Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children, the children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to someone who hates them and cares nothing about them!",
      "He paused, evidently much moved.",
      "Yes, indeed, I see that.",
      "But what can Anna do?",
      "queried Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation, he said, calming himself with an effort.",
      "Anna can, it depends on her....",
      "Even to petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential.",
      "And that depends on Anna.",
      "Her husband agreed to a divorce at that time your husband had arranged it completely.",
      "And now, I know, he would not refuse it.",
      "It is only a matter of writing to him.",
      "He said plainly at that time that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse.",
      "Of course, he said gloomily, it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of which only such heartless men are capable.",
      "He knows what agony any recollection of him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a letter from her.",
      "I can understand that it is agony to her.",
      "But the matter is of such importance, that one must _passer par-dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment.",
      "Il y va du bonheur et de l existence d Anne et de ses enfants._ I won t speak of myself, though it s hard for me, very hard, he said, with an expression as though he were threatening someone for its being hard for him.",
      "And so it is, princess, that I am shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation.",
      "Help me to persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.",
      "Yes, of course, Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly recalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Yes, of course, she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna.",
      "Use your influence with her, make her write.",
      "I don t like I m almost unable to speak about this to her.",
      "Very well, I will talk to her.",
      "But how is it she does not think of it herself?",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at that point recalled Anna s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.",
      "And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper questions of life were touched upon.",
      "Just as though she half-shut her eyes to her own life, so as not to see everything, thought Dolly.",
      "Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her, Dolly said in reply to his look of gratitude.",
      "They got up and walked to the house.",
      "Chapter 22 When Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her eyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with Vronsky, but she made no inquiry in words.",
      "I believe it s dinner time, she said.",
      "We ve not seen each other at all yet.",
      "I am reckoning on the evening.",
      "Now I want to go and dress.",
      "I expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.",
      "Dolly went to her room and she felt amused.",
      "To change her dress was impossible, for she had already put on her best dress.",
      "But in order to signify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to brush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her head.",
      "This is all I can do, she said with a smile to Anna, who came in to her in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.",
      "Yes, we are too formal here, she said, as it were apologizing for her magnificence.",
      "Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at anything.",
      "He has completely lost his heart to you, she added.",
      "There was no time for talking about anything before dinner.",
      "Going into the drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats.",
      "The architect wore a swallow-tail coat.",
      "Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his guest.",
      "The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.",
      "A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies got up.",
      "Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself offered his arm to Dolly.",
      "Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering his arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and the doctor walked in alone.",
      "The dinner, the dining-room, the service, the waiting at table, the wine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of modern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous and modern.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to her, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household although she never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as it was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she could not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom it was all done.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviazhsky, and many other people she knew, would never have considered this question, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host tries to make his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered in his house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of itself.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the children s breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where so complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained, someone must give earnest attention to its organization.",
      "And from the glance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way he nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice between cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and maintained by the care of the master of the house himself.",
      "It was evident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky.",
      "She, Sviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light hearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.",
      "Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation.",
      "The conversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small table with persons present, like the steward and the architect, belonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be overawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to sustain a large share in the general conversation.",
      "But this difficult conversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and indeed she did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna observed.",
      "The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and Veslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began describing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club.",
      "But Anna, seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw him out of his silence.",
      "Nikolay Ivanitch was struck, she said, meaning Sviazhsky, at the progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.",
      "It s first-rate working with his excellency, said the architect with a smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his own dignity).",
      "It s a very different matter to have to do with the district authorities.",
      "Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here I call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.",
      "The American way of doing business, said Sviazhsky, with a smile.",
      "Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....",
      "The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United States, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to draw the steward into talk.",
      "Have you ever seen a reaping machine?",
      "she said, addressing Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "We had just ridden over to look at one when we met.",
      "It s the first time I ever saw one.",
      "How do they work?",
      "Exactly like little scissors.",
      "A plank and a lot of little scissors.",
      "Like this.",
      "Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings, and began showing how the machine worked.",
      "It was clear that she saw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.",
      "More like little penknives, Veslovsky said playfully, never taking his eyes off her.",
      "Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer.",
      "Isn t it true, Karl Fedoritch, that it s just like little scissors?",
      "she said to the steward.",
      "_Oh, ja,_ answered the German.",
      "_ Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding, _ and he began to explain the construction of the machine.",
      "It s a pity it doesn t bind too.",
      "I saw one at the Vienna exhibition, which binds with a wire, said Sviazhsky.",
      "They would be more profitable in use.",
      "_ Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.",
      "_ And the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.",
      "_ Das l sst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.",
      "_ The German was just feeling in the pocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in, but recollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky s chilly glance, he checked himself.",
      "_ Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot, _ he concluded.",
      "_ W nscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots, _ said Vassenka Veslovsky, mimicking the German.",
      "_ J adore l allemand, _ he addressed Anna again with the same smile.",
      "_ Cessez, _ she said with playful severity.",
      "We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch, she said to the doctor, a sickly-looking man; have you been there?",
      "I went there, but I had taken flight, the doctor answered with gloomy jocoseness.",
      "Then you ve taken a good constitutional?",
      "Well, and how was the old woman?",
      "I hope it s not typhus?",
      "Typhus it is not, but it s taking a bad turn.",
      "said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to her domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.",
      "It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your description, Anna Arkadyevna, Sviazhsky said jestingly.",
      "Oh, no, why so?",
      "said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew there was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that had been noticed by Sviazhsky.",
      "This new trait of girlish coquettishness made an unpleasant impression on Dolly.",
      "But Anna Arkadyevna s knowledge of architecture is marvelous, said Tushkevitch.",
      "To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths and damp-courses, said Veslovsky.",
      "Have I got it right?",
      "There s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of it, said Anna.",
      "But, I dare say, you don t even know what houses are made of?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that existed between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her will.",
      "Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin.",
      "He obviously attached no significance to Veslovsky s chattering; on the contrary, he encouraged his jests.",
      "Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?",
      "By cement, of course.",
      "And what is cement?",
      "Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty, said Veslovsky, raising a general laugh.",
      "The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect, and the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a conversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on another, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick.",
      "Once Darya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she positively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said anything extreme or unpleasant.",
      "Sviazhsky began talking of Levin, describing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its effects on Russian agriculture.",
      "I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin, Vronsky said, smiling, but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns; or if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad.",
      "What sort of views can anyone have on such a subject?",
      "Turkish views, in general, Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a smile.",
      "I can t defend his opinions, Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up; but I can say that he s a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of doing so.",
      "I like him extremely, and we are great friends, Sviazhsky said, smiling good-naturedly.",
      "_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqu ;_ he maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.",
      "It s our Russian apathy, said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced decanter into a delicate glass on a high stem; we ve no sense of the duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize these duties.",
      "I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties, said Darya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky s tone of superiority.",
      "For my part, pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or other keenly affected by this conversation, such as I am, I am, on the contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to Nikolay Ivanitch (he indicated Sviazhsky), in electing me a justice of the peace.",
      "I consider that for me the duty of being present at the session, of judging some peasants quarrel about a horse, is as important as anything I can do.",
      "And I shall regard it as an honor if they elect me for the district council.",
      "It s only in that way I can pay for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner.",
      "Unluckily they don t understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the state.",
      "It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he was of being right at his own table.",
      "She thought how Levin, who believed the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own table.",
      "But she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.",
      "So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?",
      "But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the spot by the eighth.",
      "If you would do me the honor to stop with me.",
      "I rather agree with your _beau-fr re_, said Anna, though not quite on the same ground as he, she added with a smile.",
      "I m afraid that we have too many of these public duties in these latter days.",
      "Just as in old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to call in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone s doing some sort of public duty.",
      "Alexey has been here now six months, and he s a member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies.",
      "_Du train que cela va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it.",
      "And I m afraid that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they ll end in being a mere form.",
      "How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?",
      "she turned to Sviazhsky over twenty, I fancy.",
      "Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it instantly.",
      "She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky s face had immediately taken a serious and obstinate expression.",
      "Noticing this, and that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation by talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky had without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the country, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was connected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.",
      "The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good; but it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners and balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it all had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an ordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable impression on her.",
      "After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn tennis.",
      "The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides of a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and rolled croquet-ground.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but it was a long time before she could understand the game, and by the time she did understand it, she was so tired that she sat down with Princess Varvara and simply looked on at the players.",
      "Her partner, Tushkevitch, gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a long time.",
      "Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously.",
      "They kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without haste or getting in each other s way, they ran adroitly up to them, waited for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over the net.",
      "Veslovsky played worse than the others.",
      "He was too eager, but he kept the players lively with his high spirits.",
      "His laughter and outcries never paused.",
      "Like the other men of the party, with the ladies permission, he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory.",
      "When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she closed her eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.",
      "During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself.",
      "She did not like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time between Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether of grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child s game.",
      "But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time somehow, after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be enjoying it.",
      "All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in a theater with actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was spoiling the whole performance.",
      "She had come with the intention of staying two days, if all went well.",
      "But in the evening, during the game, she made up her mind that she would go home next day.",
      "The maternal cares and worries, which she had so hated on the way, now, after a day spent without them, struck her in quite another light, and tempted her back to them.",
      "When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya Alexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.",
      "It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to see her immediately.",
      "She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.",
      "Chapter 23 Dolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her, attired for the night.",
      "In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to speak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she had stopped: Afterwards, by ourselves, we ll talk about everything.",
      "I ve got so much I want to tell you, she said.",
      "Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.",
      "She sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her own mind all the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible beforehand, and she found nothing.",
      "At that moment it seemed to her that everything had been said already.",
      "Well, what of Kitty?",
      "she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently at Dolly.",
      "Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn t she angry with me?",
      "Angry?",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.",
      "But she hates me, despises me?",
      "But you know that sort of thing isn t forgiven.",
      "Yes, yes, said Anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.",
      "But I was not to blame.",
      "And who is to blame?",
      "What s the meaning of being to blame?",
      "Could it have been otherwise?",
      "Could it possibly have happened that you didn t become the wife of Stiva?",
      "Really, I don t know.",
      "But this is what I want you to tell me....",
      "Yes, yes, but we ve not finished about Kitty.",
      "Is she happy?",
      "He s a very nice man, they say.",
      "He s much more than very nice.",
      "I don t know a better man.",
      "Ah, how glad I am!",
      "Much more than very nice, she repeated.",
      "Dolly smiled.",
      "But tell me about yourself.",
      "We ve a great deal to talk about.",
      "And I ve had a talk with.... Dolly did not know what to call him.",
      "She felt it awkward to call him either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.",
      "With Alexey, said Anna, I know what you talked about.",
      "But I wanted to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
      "How am I to say like that straight off?",
      "No, tell me all the same.... You see my life.",
      "But you mustn t forget that you re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we are not alone....",
      "But we came here early in the spring, lived quite alone, and shall be alone again, and I desire nothing better.",
      "But imagine me living alone without him, alone, and that will be ...",
      "I see by everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the time away from home, she said, getting up and sitting down close by Dolly.",
      "Of course, she interrupted Dolly, who would have answered, of course I won t try to keep him by force.",
      "I don t keep him indeed.",
      "The races are just coming, his horses are running, he will go.",
      "I m very glad.",
      "But think of me, fancy my position....",
      "But what s the use of talking about it?",
      "She smiled.",
      "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
      "He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it s easy for me to be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether you could not.... (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated) correct, improve your position.... You know how I look at it....",
      "But all the same, if possible, you should get married.... Divorce, you mean?",
      "Do you know, the only woman who came to see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya?",
      "You know her, of course?",
      "_Au fond, c est la femme la plus deprav e qui existe._ She had an intrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest way.",
      "And she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was irregular.",
      "Don t imagine I would compare ...",
      "I know you, darling.",
      "But I could not help remembering.... Well, so what did he say to you?",
      "He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own.",
      "Perhaps you will say that it s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism.",
      "He wants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband, to have a legal right to you.",
      "What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?",
      "she put in gloomily.",
      "The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer.",
      "That s impossible.",
      "Well, and the most legitimate desire he wishes that your children should have a name.",
      "What children?",
      "Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her eyes.",
      "Annie and those to come....",
      "He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.",
      "How can you tell that you won t?",
      "I shall not, because I don t wish it.",
      "And, in spite of all her emotion, Anna smiled, as she caught the na ve expression of curiosity, wonder, and horror on Dolly s face.",
      "The doctor told me after my illness....",
      "said Dolly, opening her eyes wide.",
      "For her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and deductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the first instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one will have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.",
      "This discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or two children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her, aroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that she had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder at Anna.",
      "This was the very thing she had been dreaming of, but now learning that it was possible, she was horrified.",
      "She felt that it was too simple a solution of too complicated a problem.",
      "_ N est-ce pas immoral?",
      "_ was all she said, after a brief pause.",
      "Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be with child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my husband practically my husband, Anna said in a tone intentionally superficial and frivolous.",
      "Yes, yes, said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very arguments she had used to herself, and not finding the same force in them as before.",
      "For you, for other people, said Anna, as though divining her thoughts, there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You must consider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me.",
      "And how am I to keep his love?",
      "Not like this!",
      "She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas and memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna s head.",
      "I, she thought, did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others, and the first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively.",
      "He deserted her and took another.",
      "And can Anna attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way?",
      "If that is what he looks for, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and charming.",
      "And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and charming husband does.",
      "Dolly made no answer, she merely sighed.",
      "Anna noticed this sigh, indicating dissent, and she went on.",
      "In her armory she had other arguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.",
      "Do you say that it s not right?",
      "But you must consider, she went on; you forget my position.",
      "How can I desire children?",
      "I m not speaking of the suffering, I m not afraid of that.",
      "Think only, what are my children to be?",
      "Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger s name.",
      "For the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their mother, their father, their birth.",
      "But that is just why a divorce is necessary.",
      "But Anna did not hear her.",
      "She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she had so many times convinced herself.",
      "What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing unhappy beings into the world!",
      "She looked at Dolly, but without waiting for a reply she went on: I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children, she said.",
      "If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are unhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.",
      "These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own reflections; but she heard them without understanding them.",
      "How can one wrong creatures that don t exist?",
      "And all at once the idea struck her: could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been better for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed?",
      "And this seemed to her so wild, so strange, that she shook her head to drive away this tangle of whirling, mad ideas.",
      "No, I don t know; it s not right, was all she said, with an expression of disgust on her face.",
      "Yes, but you mustn t forget that you and I.... And besides that, added Anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of Dolly s objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right, don t forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position as you.",
      "For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them?",
      "And that s a great difference.",
      "You must see that I can t desire it in my position.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made no reply.",
      "She suddenly felt that she had got far away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions on which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to speak.",
      "Chapter 24 Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position, if possible, said Dolly.",
      "Yes, if possible, said Anna, speaking all at once in an utterly different tone, subdued and mournful.",
      "Surely you don t mean a divorce is impossible?",
      "I was told your husband had consented to it.",
      "Dolly, I don t want to talk about that.",
      "Oh, we won t then, Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the expression of suffering on Anna s face.",
      "All I see is that you take too gloomy a view of things.",
      "Not at all!",
      "I m always bright and happy.",
      "You see, _je fais des passions._ Veslovsky....",
      "Yes, to tell the truth, I don t like Veslovsky s tone, said Darya Alexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.",
      "Oh, that s nonsense!",
      "It amuses Alexey, and that s all; but he s a boy, and quite under my control.",
      "You know, I turn him as I please.",
      "It s just as it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!",
      "she suddenly changed the subject you say I take too gloomy a view of things.",
      "You can t understand.",
      "It s too awful!",
      "I try not to take any view of it at all.",
      "But I think you ought to.",
      "You ought to do all you can.",
      "But what can I do?",
      "You tell me to marry Alexey, and say I don t think about it.",
      "I don t think about it!",
      "she repeated, and a flush rose into her face.",
      "She got up, straightening her chest, and sighed heavily.",
      "With her light step she began pacing up and down the room, stopping now and then.",
      "I don t think of it?",
      "Not a day, not an hour passes that I don t think of it, and blame myself for thinking of it ... because thinking of that may drive me mad.",
      "Drive me mad!",
      "When I think of it, I can t sleep without morphine.",
      "But never mind.",
      "Let us talk quietly.",
      "They tell me, divorce.",
      "In the first place, he won t give me a divorce.",
      "He s under the influence of Countess Lidia Ivanovna now.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her head, following Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.",
      "You ought to make the attempt, she said softly.",
      "Suppose I make the attempt.",
      "she said, evidently giving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over and learned by heart.",
      "It means that I, hating him, but still recognizing that I have wronged him and I consider him magnanimous that I humiliate myself to write to him.... Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.",
      "Either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent.... Well, I have received his consent, say.... Anna was at that moment at the furthest end of the room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain at the window.",
      "I receive his consent, but my ... my son?",
      "They won t give him up to me.",
      "He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom I ve abandoned.",
      "Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more than myself two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.",
      "She came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with her arms pressed tightly across her chest.",
      "In her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad.",
      "She bent her head, and with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at Dolly, a thin little pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap, shaking all over with emotion.",
      "It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the other.",
      "I can t have them together, and that s the only thing I want.",
      "And since I can t have that, I don t care about the rest.",
      "I don t care about anything, anything.",
      "And it will end one way or another, and so I can t, I don t like to talk of it.",
      "So don t blame me, don t judge me for anything.",
      "You can t with your pure heart understand all that I m suffering.",
      "She went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty look, peeped into her face and took her hand.",
      "What are you thinking about me?",
      "Don t despise me.",
      "I don t deserve contempt.",
      "I m simply unhappy.",
      "If anyone is unhappy, I am, she articulated, and turning away, she burst into tears.",
      "Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed.",
      "She had felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but now she could not force herself to think of her.",
      "The memories of home and of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm quite new to her, with a sort of new brilliance.",
      "That world of her own seemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any account spend an extra day outside it, and she made up her mind that she would certainly go back next day.",
      "Anna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine-glass and dropped into it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient was morphine.",
      "After drinking it off and sitting still a little while, she went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.",
      "When she went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her.",
      "He was looking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so long in Dolly s room, she must have had with her.",
      "But in her expression of restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could find nothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was used to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should affect him.",
      "He did not want to ask her what they had been talking of, but he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord.",
      "But she only said: I am so glad you like Dolly.",
      "You do, don t you?",
      "Oh, I ve known her a long while, you know.",
      "She s very good-hearted, I suppose, _mais excessivement terre- -terre._ Still, I m very glad to see her.",
      "He took Anna s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.",
      "Misinterpreting the look, she smiled to him.",
      "Next morning, in spite of the protests of her hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her homeward journey.",
      "Levin s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby hat, with his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards, drove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the gentlemen of the party.",
      "After a day spent together, both she and her hosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that it was better for them not to meet.",
      "Only Anna was sad.",
      "She knew that now, from Dolly s departure, no one again would stir up within her soul the feelings that had been roused by their conversation.",
      "It hurt her to stir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best part of her soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in the life she was leading.",
      "As she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a delightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how they had liked being at Vronsky s, when suddenly the coachman, Philip, expressed himself unasked: Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they gave us.",
      "Everything cleared up till there wasn t a grain left by cockcrow.",
      "What are three pots?",
      "A mere mouthful!",
      "And oats now down to forty-five kopecks.",
      "At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much as they can eat.",
      "The master s a screw, put in the counting-house clerk.",
      "Well, did you like their horses?",
      "The horses!",
      "there s no two opinions about them.",
      "And the food was good.",
      "But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "I don t know what you thought, he said, turning his handsome, good-natured face to her.",
      "I thought so too.",
      "Well, shall we get home by evening?",
      "Eh, we must!",
      "On reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and particularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness telling them how she had arrived, how warmly they had received her, of the luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their recreations, and she would not allow a word to be said against them.",
      "One has to know Anna and Vronsky I have got to know him better now to see how nice they are, and how touching, she said, speaking now with perfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction and awkwardness she had experienced there.",
      "Chapter 25 Vronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the country, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps to obtain a divorce.",
      "It was an understood thing between them that they should not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived alone, especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they could not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.",
      "Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.",
      "They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and both had occupation.",
      "Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance when they had no visitors, and she did a great deal of reading, both of novels and of what serious literature was in fashion.",
      "She ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she received, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only given to what is read in seclusion.",
      "Moreover, every subject that was of interest to Vronsky, she studied in books and special journals, so that he often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or architecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding or sport.",
      "He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was disposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she would find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him.",
      "The building of the hospital, too, interested her.",
      "She did not merely assist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself.",
      "But her chief thought was still of herself how far she was dear to Vronsky, how far she could make up to him for all he had given up.",
      "Vronsky appreciated this desire not only to please, but to serve him, which had become the sole aim of her existence, but at the same time he wearied of the loving snares in which she tried to hold him fast.",
      "As time went on, and he saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he had an ever growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether they hindered his freedom.",
      "Had it not been for this growing desire to be free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a meeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his life.",
      "The r le he had taken up, the r le of a wealthy landowner, one of that class which ought to be the very heart of the Russian aristocracy, was entirely to his taste; and now, after spending six months in that character, he derived even greater satisfaction from it.",
      "And his management of his estate, which occupied and absorbed him more and more, was most successful.",
      "In spite of the immense sums cost him by the hospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and many other things, he was convinced that he was not wasting, but increasing his substance.",
      "In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber, wheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, and knew well how to keep up prices.",
      "In all operations on a large scale on this and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods involving no risk, and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an extreme degree.",
      "In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the German steward, who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his original estimate always far larger than really required, and then representing to Vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper, and so make a profit, Vronsky did not give in.",
      "He listened to his steward, cross-examined him, and only agreed to his suggestions when the implement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet known in Russia, and likely to excite wonder.",
      "Apart from such exceptions, he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a surplus, and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest details, and insisted on getting the very best for his money; so that by the method on which he managed his affairs, it was clear that he was not wasting, but increasing his substance.",
      "In October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky province, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev, Oblonsky, and a small part of Levin s land.",
      "These elections were attracting public attention from several circumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part in them.",
      "There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great preparations were being made for them.",
      "Persons who never attended the elections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to attend these.",
      "Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.",
      "Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove over to fetch Vronsky.",
      "On the day before there had been almost a quarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition.",
      "It was the very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold expression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before.",
      "But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great composure, and merely asked when he would be back.",
      "He looked intently at her, at a loss to explain this composure.",
      "She smiled at his look.",
      "He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans.",
      "He was afraid of this; but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in her reasonableness.",
      "I hope you won t be dull?",
      "I hope not, said Anna.",
      "I got a box of books yesterday from Gautier s. No, I shan t be dull.",
      "She s trying to take that tone, and so much the better, he thought, or else it would be the same thing over and over again.",
      "And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation.",
      "It was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation.",
      "From one point of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that it was better so.",
      "At first there will be, as this time, something undefined kept back, and then she will get used to it.",
      "In any case I can give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence, he thought.",
      "Chapter 26 In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty s confinement.",
      "He had spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey Ivanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to set off to the elections.",
      "He invited his brother, who had a vote in the Seleznevsky district, to come with him.",
      "Levin had, moreover, to transact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister, who was abroad.",
      "Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow, and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper nobleman s uniform, costing seven pounds.",
      "And that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.",
      "He went to Kashin.... Levin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and busily engaged about his sister s business, which still dragged on.",
      "The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship.",
      "The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was met too by difficulties.",
      "After long negotiations over the legal details, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most obliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have the signature of the president, and the president, though he had not given over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections.",
      "All these worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner s position, but were powerless to assist him all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force.",
      "He felt this frequently as he talked to his most good-natured solicitor.",
      "This solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties.",
      "I tell you what you might try, he said more than once; go to so-and-so and so-and-so, and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything.",
      "But he would add immediately, It ll mean some delay, anyway, but you might try it.",
      "And Levin did try, and did go.",
      "Everyone was kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and again to bar the way.",
      "What was particularly trying, was that Levin could not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest it was that his business should not be done.",
      "That no one seemed to know; the solicitor certainly did not know.",
      "If Levin could have understood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him.",
      "But with the hindrances that confronted him in his business, no one could explain why they existed.",
      "But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient, and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.",
      "In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected.",
      "Since his marriage there had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no importance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections.",
      "The marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions the guardianship of wards (the very department which was giving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female, male, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and finally, the district council the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school, dissipating an immense fortune, a good-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.",
      "He always took, in every question, the side of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education, and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance.",
      "What was needed was to put in his place a fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not as the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract all the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from them.",
      "In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces for all Russia.",
      "And hence the whole question was of the greatest importance.",
      "It was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still, Nevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the nobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard for persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and hoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as at all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch.",
      "When he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even enthusiastically followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.",
      "Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: Please tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn t come to the Home.",
      "And thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral.",
      "In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do.",
      "Church services always affected Levin, and as he uttered the words I kiss the cross, and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt touched.",
      "On the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance whatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after his own affairs, did not attend the meetings.",
      "On the fourth day the auditing of the marshal s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province.",
      "And then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old.",
      "The committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.",
      "The marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, and shed tears.",
      "The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and shook hands with him.",
      "But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey Ivanovitch s party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province.",
      "One of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this.",
      "Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction.",
      "Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he developed this dilemma in detail.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party.",
      "Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant gentleman again.",
      "The discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing.",
      "Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch answered: Oh, no!",
      "He s an honest man.",
      "But those old-fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down.",
      "On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals.",
      "It was rather a stormy day in several districts.",
      "In the Seleznevsky district Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a dinner that evening.",
      "Chapter 27 The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province.",
      "The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms.",
      "Many had come only for that day.",
      "Men who had not seen each other for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility.",
      "There was much discussion around the governor s table under the portrait of the Tsar.",
      "The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped themselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group, and from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the farther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the other.",
      "In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes: the old and the new.",
      "The old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats, or in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.",
      "The uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them.",
      "The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace.",
      "To the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd.",
      "But the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties.",
      "Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the contrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party.",
      "Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking light refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what they were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves.",
      "He was listening at that moment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who belonged to their party.",
      "Hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to do so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan.",
      "Levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch, came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.",
      "We are placing our forces, he said, pulling out his whiskers, Sergey Ivanovitch!",
      "And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky s contention.",
      "One district s enough, and Sviazhsky s obviously of the opposition, he said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.",
      "Why, Kostya, you here too!",
      "I suppose you re converted, eh?",
      "he added, turning to Levin and drawing his arm through his.",
      "Levin would have been glad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was, and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan Arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand.",
      "_ O sancta simplicitas!",
      "_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and clearly he explained it to Levin.",
      "If, as at previous elections, all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be elected without a ballot.",
      "That must not be.",
      "Now eight districts had agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their party, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning.",
      "But if only one district, Sviazhsky s, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov would let himself be balloted for.",
      "They were even, some of them, going to vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him some votes.",
      "Levin understood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room.",
      "whom?",
      "No guarantee?",
      "whose?",
      "They won t pass him?",
      "They won t let Flerov in?",
      "Eh, because of the charge against him?",
      "Why, at this rate, they won t admit anyone.",
      "It s a swindle!",
      "The law!",
      "Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he moved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something.",
      "Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something.",
      "Chapter 28 Levin was standing rather far off.",
      "A nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking, prevented him from hearing distinctly.",
      "He could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky.",
      "They were disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: liable to be called up for trial.",
      "The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.",
      "The act said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted him.",
      "He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he shouted loudly: A ballot!",
      "Put it to the vote!",
      "No need for more talking!",
      "Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.",
      "But it was impossible to make out what he said.",
      "He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but it was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other side.",
      "Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that the marshal of the province had to call for order.",
      "A ballot!",
      "Every nobleman sees it!",
      "We shed our blood for our country!...",
      "The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the accounts of the marshal; he s not a cashier....",
      "But that s not the point....",
      "Votes, please!",
      "Beastly!...",
      "shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.",
      "Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.",
      "They expressed the most implacable hatred.",
      "Levin did not in the least understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov should be put to the vote.",
      "He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov s right to vote; that to secure the recognition of Flerov s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.",
      "And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life, concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.",
      "To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.",
      "Seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air.",
      "He began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters.",
      "He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.",
      "Levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic, drew him away.",
      "Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, he said, your brother s looking for you.",
      "They are voting on the legal point.",
      "Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.",
      "Levin advanced, but utterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned to Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, Where am I to put it?",
      "He asked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard.",
      "But the persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.",
      "That is a matter for each man s own decision, he said severely.",
      "Several people smiled.",
      "Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.",
      "Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.",
      "A hundred and twenty-six for admission!",
      "Ninety-eight against!",
      "sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_.",
      "Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.",
      "The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had conquered.",
      "But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.",
      "Levin heard that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something.",
      "Levin went nearer.",
      "In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.",
      "Several times he repeated the words: I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you, and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the room.",
      "Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of the position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies, his emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov.",
      "In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.",
      "Beg pardon, excuse me, please, he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.",
      "It seemed to Levin that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.",
      "His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.",
      "This expression in the marshal s face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man.",
      "The big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter s daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin.",
      "This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something pleasant to him.",
      "So you re sure to be our marshal again, he said.",
      "It s not likely, said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.",
      "I m worn out, I m old.",
      "If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.",
      "And the marshal disappeared through a side door.",
      "The most solemn moment was at hand.",
      "They were to proceed immediately to the election.",
      "The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers.",
      "The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov s vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party.",
      "Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.",
      "On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.",
      "I ve brought one, drenched him with water, said the landowner, who had gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky.",
      "He s all right?",
      "he ll do.",
      "Not too drunk, he won t fall down?",
      "said Sviazhsky, shaking his head.",
      "No, he s first-rate.",
      "If only they don t give him any more here....",
      "I ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account.",
      "Chapter 29 The narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments, was full of noblemen.",
      "The excitement grew more intense, and every face betrayed some uneasiness.",
      "The excitement was specially keen for the leaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every vote.",
      "They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.",
      "The rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the interval.",
      "Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the table; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking cigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long while.",
      "Levin did not care to eat, and he was not smoking; he did not want to join his own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, Sviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his equerry s uniform was standing with them in eager conversation.",
      "Levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not caring to greet him.",
      "He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening to what was being said around him.",
      "He felt depressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager, anxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little man with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had no interest in it and nothing to do.",
      "He s such a blackguard!",
      "I have told him so, but it makes no difference.",
      "Only think of it!",
      "He couldn t collect it in three years!",
      "he heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short, country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke.",
      "Casting a displeased glance at Levin, this gentleman sharply turned his back.",
      "Yes, it s a dirty business, there s no denying, a small gentleman assented in a high voice.",
      "Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general, hurriedly came near Levin.",
      "These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.",
      "How dare he say I had his breeches stolen!",
      "Pawned them for drink, I expect.",
      "Damn the fellow, prince indeed!",
      "He d better not say it, the beast!",
      "But excuse me!",
      "They take their stand on the act, was being said in another group; the wife must be registered as noble.",
      "Oh, damn your acts!",
      "I speak from my heart.",
      "We re all gentlemen, aren t we?",
      "Above suspicion.",
      "Shall we go on, your excellency, _fine champagne?_ Another group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a loud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.",
      "I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can never save a profit, he heard a pleasant voice say.",
      "The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff-officer.",
      "It was the very landowner Levin had met at Sviazhsky s. He knew him at once.",
      "The landowner too stared at Levin, and they exchanged greetings.",
      "Very glad to see you!",
      "I remember you very well.",
      "Last year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch s. Well, and how is your land doing?",
      "Oh, still just the same, always at a loss, the landowner answered with a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be.",
      "And how do you come to be in our province?",
      "Come to take part in our _coup d tat?_ he said, confidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent.",
      "All Russia s here gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the ministry.",
      "He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a general.",
      "I ought to own that I don t very well understand the drift of the provincial elections, said Levin.",
      "The landowner looked at him.",
      "Why, what is there to understand?",
      "There s no meaning in it at all.",
      "It s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia.",
      "Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it s an assembly of justices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but not of noblemen.",
      "Then why do you come?",
      "From habit, nothing else.",
      "Then, too, one must keep up connections.",
      "It s a moral obligation of a sort.",
      "And then, to tell the truth, there s one s own interests.",
      "My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent member; they re not rich people, and he must be brought forward.",
      "These gentlemen, now, what do they come for?",
      "he said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.",
      "That s the new generation of nobility.",
      "New it may be, but nobility it isn t. They re proprietors of a sort, but we re the landowners.",
      "As noblemen, they re cutting their own throats.",
      "But you say it s an institution that s served its time.",
      "That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.",
      "Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but we re the growth of a thousand years.",
      "If we re laying out a garden, planning one before the house, you know, and there you ve a tree that s stood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and yet you don t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds, but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree.",
      "You won t grow him again in a year, he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation.",
      "Well, and how is your land doing?",
      "Oh, not very well.",
      "I make five per cent.",
      "Yes, but you don t reckon your own work.",
      "Aren t you worth something too?",
      "I ll tell you my own case.",
      "Before I took to seeing after the land, I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service.",
      "Now I do more work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent.",
      "on the land, and thank God for that.",
      "But one s work is thrown in for nothing.",
      "Then why do you do it, if it s a clear loss?",
      "Oh, well, one does it!",
      "It s habit, and one knows it s how it should be.",
      "And what s more, the landowner went on, leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on, my son, I must tell you, has no taste for it.",
      "There s no doubt he ll be a scientific man.",
      "So there ll be no one to keep it up.",
      "And yet one does it.",
      "Here this year I ve planted an orchard.",
      "Yes, yes, said Levin, that s perfectly true.",
      "I always feel there s no real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....",
      "It s a sort of duty one feels to the land.",
      "But I tell you what, the landowner pursued; a neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place.",
      "We walked about the fields and the garden.",
      "No, said he, Stepan Vassilievitch, everything s well looked after, but your garden s neglected.",
      "But, as a fact, it s well kept up.",
      "To my thinking, I d cut down that lime-tree.",
      "Here you ve thousands of limes, and each would make two good bundles of bark.",
      "And nowadays that bark s worth something.",
      "I d cut down the lot.",
      "And with what he made he d increase his stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants, Levin added, smiling.",
      "He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.",
      "And he d make his fortune.",
      "But you and I must thank God if we keep what we ve got and leave it to our children.",
      "You re married, I ve heard?",
      "said the landowner.",
      "Yes, Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.",
      "Yes, it s rather strange, he went on.",
      "So we live without making anything, as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.",
      "The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.",
      "There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that s settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it.",
      "But why is it we don t do like the merchants?",
      "Why don t we cut down our parks for timber?",
      "said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him.",
      "Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.",
      "Besides that s not work for a nobleman.",
      "And our work as noblemen isn t done here at the elections, but yonder, each in our corner.",
      "There s a class instinct, too, of what one ought and oughtn t to do.",
      "There s the peasants, too, I wonder at them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.",
      "However bad the land is, he ll work it.",
      "Without a return too.",
      "At a simple loss.",
      "Just as we do, said Levin.",
      "Very, very glad to have met you, he added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.",
      "And here we ve met for the first time since we met at your place, said the landowner to Sviazhsky, and we ve had a good talk too.",
      "Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?",
      "said Sviazhsky with a smile.",
      "That we re bound to do.",
      "You ve relieved your feelings?",
      "Chapter 30 Sviazhsky took Levin s arm, and went with him to his own friends.",
      "This time there was no avoiding Vronsky.",
      "He was standing with Stepan Arkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he drew near.",
      "I believe I ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at Princess Shtcherbatskaya s, he said, giving Levin his hand.",
      "Yes, I quite remember our meeting, said Levin, and blushing crimson, he turned away immediately, and began talking to his brother.",
      "With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously without the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with Levin.",
      "But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking round at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss over his rudeness.",
      "What are we waiting for now?",
      "asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and Vronsky.",
      "For Snetkov.",
      "He has to refuse or to consent to stand, answered Sviazhsky.",
      "Well, and what has he done, consented or not?",
      "That s the point, that he s done neither, said Vronsky.",
      "And if he refuses, who will stand then?",
      "asked Levin, looking at Vronsky.",
      "Whoever chooses to, said Sviazhsky.",
      "Shall you?",
      "Certainly not I, said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an alarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Who then?",
      "Nevyedovsky?",
      "said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot into it.",
      "But this was worse still.",
      "Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two candidates.",
      "I certainly shall not, under any circumstances, answered the malignant gentleman.",
      "This was Nevyedovsky himself.",
      "Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.",
      "Well, you find it exciting too?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at Vronsky.",
      "It s something like a race.",
      "One might bet on it.",
      "Yes, it is keenly exciting, said Vronsky.",
      "And once taking the thing up, one s eager to see it through.",
      "It s a fight!",
      "he said, scowling and setting his powerful jaws.",
      "What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is!",
      "Sees it all so clearly.",
      "Vronsky assented indifferently.",
      "A silence followed, during which Vronsky since he had to look at something looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to say something: How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice of the peace?",
      "You are not in the uniform of one.",
      "It s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly institution, Levin answered gloomily.",
      "He had been all the time looking for an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to smooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.",
      "I don t think so, quite the contrary, Vronsky said, with quiet surprise.",
      "It s a plaything, Levin cut him short.",
      "We don t want justices of the peace.",
      "I ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight years.",
      "And what I have had was decided wrongly by them.",
      "The justice of the peace is over thirty miles from me.",
      "For some matter of two roubles I should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.",
      "And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and when the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander.",
      "All this was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as he said it.",
      "Oh, this is such an original fellow!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with his most soothing, almond-oil smile.",
      "But come along; I think they re voting.... And they separated.",
      "I can t understand, said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his brother s clumsiness, I can t understand how anyone can be so absolutely devoid of political tact.",
      "That s where we Russians are so deficient.",
      "The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him you re _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand.",
      "Count Vronsky, now ...",
      "I m not making a friend of him; he s asked me to dinner, and I m not going; but he s one of our side why make an enemy of him?",
      "Then you ask Nevyedovsky if he s going to stand.",
      "That s not a thing to do.",
      "Oh, I don t understand it at all!",
      "And it s all such nonsense, Levin answered gloomily.",
      "You say it s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do with it, you make a muddle.",
      "Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.",
      "The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air of some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called upon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand.",
      "All was silence in the room.",
      "The secretary announced in a loud voice that the captain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be balloted for as marshal of the province.",
      "The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from their tables to the high table, and the election began.",
      "Put it in the right side, whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his brother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table.",
      "But Levin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to him, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying the right side.",
      "Surely Snetkov was the enemy.",
      "As he went up, he held the ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box he changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left.",
      "An adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere action of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance.",
      "It was no good for him to use his insight.",
      "Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard.",
      "Then a single voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against.",
      "The marshal had been voted for by a considerable majority.",
      "All was noise and eager movement towards the doors.",
      "Snetkov came in, and the nobles thronged round him, congratulating him.",
      "Well, now is it over?",
      "Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "It s only just beginning, Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey Ivanovitch with a smile.",
      "Some other candidate may receive more votes than the marshal.",
      "Levin had quite forgotten about that.",
      "Now he could only remember that there was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think what it was exactly.",
      "He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the crowd.",
      "As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed him, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the refreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw the waiters.",
      "The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and Levin agreed.",
      "After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the waiters of their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the hall, where it was all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through the galleries.",
      "The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies, leaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of what was being said below.",
      "With the ladies were sitting and standing smart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers.",
      "Everywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried the marshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been.",
      "In one group Levin heard his brother s praises.",
      "One lady was telling a lawyer: How glad I am I heard Koznishev!",
      "It s worth losing one s dinner.",
      "He s exquisite!",
      "So clear and distinct all of it!",
      "There s not one of you in the law courts that speaks like that.",
      "The only one is Meidel, and he s not so eloquent by a long way.",
      "Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began looking and listening.",
      "All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to their districts.",
      "In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform, who shouted in a loud, high voice: As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!",
      "A dead silence followed, and then a weak old voice was heard: Declined!",
      "We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol, the voice began again.",
      "Declined!",
      "a high boyish voice replied.",
      "Again it began, and again Declined.",
      "And so it went on for about an hour.",
      "Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened.",
      "At first he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure that he could not make it out he began to be bored.",
      "Then recalling all the excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces, he felt sad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs.",
      "As he passed through the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy walking up and down with tired-looking eyes.",
      "On the stairs he met a couple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy prosecutor.",
      "I told you you weren t late, the deputy prosecutor was saying at the moment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.",
      "Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his waistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary overtook him.",
      "This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.",
      "The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so stoutly denied all idea of standing.",
      "Levin went up to the door of the room; it was locked.",
      "The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.",
      "I can t stand any more of it, said one red-faced gentleman.",
      "After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out.",
      "His face was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.",
      "I told you not to let anyone out!",
      "he cried to the doorkeeper.",
      "I let someone in, your excellency!",
      "and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his legs staggering in his white trousers.",
      "Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he was the new marshal of the province.",
      "Many people were amused, many were pleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and unhappy.",
      "The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair, which he could not conceal.",
      "When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the crowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as they had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as they had followed Snetkov when he was elected.",
      "Chapter 31 The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself.",
      "But he had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that he would be so good at this kind of thing.",
      "He was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was unmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence.",
      "This influence was due to his wealth and reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a schoolfellow of Vronsky s a schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed.",
      "But what contributed more than all to his success was his direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness.",
      "He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _ propos de bottes_ poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent.",
      "He saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he had done a great deal to secure the success of Nevyedovsky.",
      "And now at his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky s election, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate.",
      "The election itself had so fascinated him that, if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years, he began to think of standing himself much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race himself.",
      "Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey.",
      "Vronsky sat at the head of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general of high rank.",
      "To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he was little Katka Maslov that had been his nickname in the Pages Corps whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre son aise_.",
      "On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and malignant face.",
      "With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.",
      "Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly.",
      "It was indeed no failure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to Nevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the new movement, which the nobility ought to follow.",
      "And so every honest person, as he said, was on the side of today s success and was rejoicing over it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and that everyone was pleased.",
      "The episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner.",
      "Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears.",
      "Another nobleman jocosely described how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal s ball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new marshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.",
      "Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: our marshal, and your excellency.",
      "This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called Madame and her husband s name.",
      "Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that he was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.",
      "After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the result of the election.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good humor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram: Nevyedovsky elected by twenty votes.",
      "Congratulations.",
      "Tell people.",
      "He dictated it aloud, saying: We must let them share our rejoicing.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and understood that it was an after-dinner affair.",
      "She knew Stiva had a weakness after dining for _faire jouer le t l graphe._ Everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from Russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely dignified, simple, and enjoyable.",
      "The party some twenty had been selected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well bred.",
      "They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of our amiable host.",
      "Vronsky was satisfied.",
      "He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone in the provinces.",
      "Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively.",
      "The governor asked Vronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his wife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.",
      "There ll be a ball, and you ll see the belle of the province.",
      "Worth seeing, really.",
      "Not in my line, Vronsky answered.",
      "He liked that English phrase.",
      "But he smiled, and promised to come.",
      "Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking, Vronsky s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.",
      "From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger, he said with a significant expression.",
      "Astonishing!",
      "how like he is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky, said one of the guests in French of the valet, while Vronsky, frowning, read the letter.",
      "The letter was from Anna.",
      "Before he read the letter, he knew its contents.",
      "Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he had promised to be back on Friday.",
      "Today was Saturday, and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed.",
      "The letter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her yet.",
      "The letter was what he had expected, but the form of it was unexpected, and particularly disagreeable to him.",
      "Annie is very ill, the doctor says it may be inflammation.",
      "I am losing my head all alone.",
      "Princess Varvara is no help, but a hindrance.",
      "I expected you the day before yesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you are and what you are doing.",
      "I wanted to come myself, but thought better of it, knowing you would dislike it.",
      "Send some answer, that I may know what to do.",
      "The child ill, yet she had thought of coming herself.",
      "Their daughter ill, and this hostile tone.",
      "The innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome love to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast.",
      "But he had to go, and by the first train that night he set off home.",
      "Chapter 32 Before Vronsky s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home, might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure.",
      "But the cold, severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her, and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.",
      "In solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed his right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same point the sense of her own humiliation.",
      "He has the right to go away when and where he chooses.",
      "Not simply to go away, but to leave me.",
      "He has every right, and I have none.",
      "But knowing that, he ought not to do it.",
      "What has he done, though?...",
      "He looked at me with a cold, severe expression.",
      "Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it has never been so before, and that glance means a great deal, she thought.",
      "That glance shows the beginning of indifference.",
      "And though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was nothing she could do, she could not in any way alter her relations to him.",
      "Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep him.",
      "And so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at night, could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to love her.",
      "It is true there was still one means; not to keep him for that she wanted nothing more than his love but to be nearer to him, to be in such a position that he would not leave her.",
      "That means was divorce and marriage.",
      "And she began to long for that, and made up her mind to agree to it the first time he or Stiva approached her on the subject.",
      "Absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five days that he was to be at the elections.",
      "Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and, most of all, reading reading of one book after another filled up her time.",
      "But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him, she felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him and of what he was doing there, just at that time her little girl was taken ill. Anna began to look after her, but even that did not distract her mind, especially as the illness was not serious.",
      "However hard she tried, she could not love this little child, and to feign love was beyond her powers.",
      "Towards the evening of that day, still alone, Anna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the town, but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that Vronsky received, and without reading it through, sent it off by a special messenger.",
      "The next morning she received his letter and regretted her own.",
      "She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had flung at her at parting, especially when he knew that the baby was not dangerously ill.",
      "But still she was glad she had written to him.",
      "At this moment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden to him, that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to her, and in spite of that she was glad he was coming.",
      "Let him weary of her, but he would be here with her, so that she would see him, would know of every action he took.",
      "She was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp, with a new volume of Taine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and every minute expecting the carriage to arrive.",
      "Several times she had fancied she heard the sound of wheels, but she had been mistaken.",
      "At last she heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman s shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry.",
      "Even Princess Varvara, playing patience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead of going down, as she had done twice before, she stood still.",
      "She suddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how he might meet her.",
      "All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure.",
      "She remembered that her child had been perfectly well again for the last two days.",
      "She felt positively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her letter was sent off.",
      "Then she thought of him, that he was here, all of him, with his hands, his eyes.",
      "She heard his voice.",
      "And forgetting everything, she ran joyfully to meet him.",
      "Well, how is Annie?",
      "he said timidly from below, looking up to Anna as she ran down to him.",
      "He was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his warm over-boot.",
      "Oh, she is better.",
      "he said, shaking himself.",
      "She took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, never taking her eyes off him.",
      "Well, I m glad, he said, coldly scanning her, her hair, her dress, which he knew she had put on for him.",
      "All was charming, but how many times it had charmed him!",
      "And the stern, stony expression that she so dreaded settled upon his face.",
      "Well, I m glad.",
      "And are you well?",
      "he said, wiping his damp beard with his handkerchief and kissing her hand.",
      "Never mind, she thought, only let him be here, and so long as he s here he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.",
      "The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess Varvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in his absence.",
      "I couldn t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me.",
      "When he s here I never take it hardly ever.",
      "He told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions to bring him to what gave him most pleasure his own success.",
      "She told him of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told him was of the most cheerful description.",
      "But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she had regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase the painful impression of the glance he had given her for her letter.",
      "She said: Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn t believe me?",
      "As soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings were to her, he had not forgiven her for that.",
      "Yes, he said, the letter was so strange.",
      "First, Annie ill, and then you thought of coming yourself.",
      "It was all the truth.",
      "Oh, I don t doubt it.",
      "Yes, you do doubt it.",
      "You are vexed, I see.",
      "Not for one moment.",
      "I m only vexed, that s true, that you seem somehow unwilling to admit that there are duties....",
      "The duty of going to a concert....",
      "But we won t talk about it, he said.",
      "Why not talk about it?",
      "I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up.",
      "Now, for instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the house.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable?",
      "Don t you know that I can t live without you?",
      "If so, said Anna, her voice suddenly changing, it means that you are sick of this life....",
      "Yes, you will come for a day and go away, as men do.... Anna, that s cruel.",
      "I am ready to give up my whole life.",
      "But she did not hear him.",
      "If you go to Moscow, I will go too.",
      "I will not stay here.",
      "Either we must separate or else live together.",
      "Why, you know, that s my one desire.",
      "But for that.... We must get a divorce.",
      "I will write to him.",
      "I see I cannot go on like this....",
      "But I will come with you to Moscow.",
      "You talk as if you were threatening me.",
      "But I desire nothing so much as never to be parted from you, said Vronsky, smiling.",
      "But as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold look, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.",
      "She saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.",
      "If so, it s a calamity!",
      "that glance told her.",
      "It was a moment s impression, but she never forgot it.",
      "Anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and towards the end of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to Petersburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow.",
      "Expecting every day an answer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now established themselves together like married people.",
      "PART SEVEN Chapter 1 The Levins had been three months in Moscow.",
      "The date had long passed on which, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned in such matters, Kitty should have been confined.",
      "But she was still about, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than two months ago.",
      "The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her mother, and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching event without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy.",
      "Kitty was the only person who felt perfectly calm and happy.",
      "She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love for the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already, and she brooded blissfully over this feeling.",
      "He was not by now altogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his own life independently of her.",
      "Often this separate being gave her pain, but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.",
      "All the people she loved were with her, and all were so good to her, so attentively caring for her, so entirely pleasant was everything presented to her, that if she had not known and felt that it must all soon be over, she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter life.",
      "The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was that her husband was not here as she loved him to be, and as he was in the country.",
      "She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country.",
      "In the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he were afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her.",
      "At home in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right place, he was never in haste to be off elsewhere.",
      "He was never unoccupied.",
      "Here in town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid of missing something, and yet he had nothing to do.",
      "And she felt sorry for him.",
      "To others, she knew, he did not appear an object of pity.",
      "On the contrary, when Kitty looked at him in society, as one sometimes looks at those one loves, trying to see him as if he were a stranger, so as to catch the impression he must make on others, she saw with a panic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable figure, that he was very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather old-fashioned, reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and striking, as she thought, and expressive face.",
      "But she saw him not from without, but from within; she saw that here he was not himself; that was the only way she could define his condition to herself.",
      "Sometimes she inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town; sometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his life here so that he could be satisfied with it.",
      "What had he to do, indeed?",
      "He did not care for cards; he did not go to a club.",
      "Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky s type she knew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere after drinking.",
      "She could not think without horror of where men went on such occasions.",
      "Was he to go into society?",
      "But she knew he could only find satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young women, and that she could not wish for.",
      "Should he stay at home with her, her mother and her sisters?",
      "But much as she liked and enjoyed their conversations forever on the same subjects Aline-Nadine, as the old prince called the sisters talks she knew it must bore him.",
      "What was there left for him to do?",
      "To go on writing at his book he had indeed attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make extracts and look up references for his book.",
      "But, as he told her, the more he did nothing, the less time he had to do anything.",
      "And besides, he complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him.",
      "One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened between them here in town.",
      "Whether it was that their conditions were different, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in that respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they had so dreaded when they moved from the country.",
      "One event, an event of great importance to both from that point of view, did indeed happen that was Kitty s meeting with Vronsky.",
      "The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty s godmother, who had always been very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her.",
      "Kitty, though she did not go into society at all on account of her condition, went with her father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.",
      "The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was that at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the features once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the blood rushed to her heart, and a vivid blush she felt it overspread her face.",
      "But this lasted only a few seconds.",
      "Before her father, who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary, exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that, to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant.",
      "She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections, which he called our parliament.",
      "(She had to smile to show she saw the joke.)",
      "But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up to go; then she looked at him, but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good-bye.",
      "She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her.",
      "She was pleased with herself.",
      "She had not expected she would have had the power, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him.",
      "Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna s. It was very hard for her to tell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a frown.",
      "I am very sorry you weren t there, she said.",
      "Not that you weren t in the room ...",
      "I couldn t have been so natural in your presence ...",
      "I am blushing now much more, much, much more, she said, blushing till the tears came into her eyes.",
      "But that you couldn t see through a crack.",
      "The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her, which was all she wanted.",
      "When he had heard everything, even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but that afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly as possible.",
      "It s so wretched to feel that there s a man almost an enemy whom it s painful to meet, said Levin.",
      "I m very, very glad.",
      "Chapter 2 Go, please, go then and call on the Bols, Kitty said to her husband, when he came in to see her at eleven o clock before going out.",
      "I know you are dining at the club; papa put down your name.",
      "But what are you going to do in the morning?",
      "I am only going to Katavasov, answered Levin.",
      "Why so early?",
      "He promised to introduce me to Metrov.",
      "I wanted to talk to him about my work.",
      "He s a distinguished scientific man from Petersburg, said Levin.",
      "Yes; wasn t it his article you were praising so?",
      "Well, and after that?",
      "I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister s business.",
      "And the concert?",
      "she queried.",
      "I shan t go there all alone.",
      "No?",
      "do go; there are going to be some new things.... That interested you so.",
      "I should certainly go.",
      "Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner, he said, looking at his watch.",
      "Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on Countess Bola.",
      "But is it absolutely necessary?",
      "Oh, absolutely!",
      "He has been to see us.",
      "Come, what is it?",
      "You go in, sit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go away.",
      "Oh, you wouldn t believe it!",
      "I ve got so out of the way of all this that it makes me feel positively ashamed.",
      "It s such a horrible thing to do!",
      "A complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to do, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!",
      "Kitty laughed.",
      "Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn t you?",
      "Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I m so out of the way of it that, by Jove!",
      "I d sooner go two days running without my dinner than pay this call!",
      "One s so ashamed!",
      "I feel all the while that they re annoyed, that they re saying, What has he come for?",
      "No, they won t. I ll answer for that, said Kitty, looking into his face with a laugh.",
      "She took his hand.",
      "Well, good-bye.... Do go, please.",
      "He was just going out after kissing his wife s hand, when she stopped him.",
      "Kostya, do you know I ve only fifty roubles left?",
      "Oh, all right, I ll go to the bank and get some.",
      "How much?",
      "he said, with the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well.",
      "She held his hand.",
      "Let s talk about it, it worries me.",
      "I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but money seems to fly away simply.",
      "We don t manage well, somehow.",
      "Oh, it s all right, he said with a little cough, looking at her from under his brows.",
      "That cough she knew well.",
      "It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not with her, but with himself.",
      "He certainly was displeased not at so much money being spent, but at being reminded of what he, knowing something was unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.",
      "I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the mill.",
      "We shall have money enough in any case.",
      "Yes, but I m afraid that altogether.... Oh, it s all right, all right, he repeated.",
      "Well, good-bye, darling.",
      "No, I m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma.",
      "How nice it would have been in the country!",
      "As it is, I m worrying you all, and we re wasting our money.",
      "Not at all, not at all.",
      "Not once since I ve been married have I said that things could have been better than they are....",
      "Truly?",
      "she said, looking into his eyes.",
      "He had said it without thinking, simply to console her.",
      "But when he glanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly on him, he repeated it with his whole heart.",
      "I was positively forgetting her, he thought.",
      "And he remembered what was before them, so soon to come.",
      "Will it be soon?",
      "he whispered, taking her two hands.",
      "I have so often thought so, that now I don t think about it or know anything about it.",
      "And you re not frightened?",
      "She smiled contemptuously.",
      "Not the least little bit, she said.",
      "Well, if anything happens, I shall be at Katavasov s. No, nothing will happen, and don t think about it.",
      "I m going for a walk on the boulevard with papa.",
      "We re going to see Dolly.",
      "I shall expect you before dinner.",
      "Do you know that Dolly s position is becoming utterly impossible?",
      "She s in debt all round; she hasn t a penny.",
      "We were talking yesterday with mamma and Arseny (this was her sister s husband Lvov), and we determined to send you with him to talk to Stiva.",
      "It s really unbearable.",
      "One can t speak to papa about it....",
      "But if you and he.... Why, what can we do?",
      "You ll be at Arseny s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we decided.",
      "Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand.",
      "I ll go and see him.",
      "By the way, if I do go to the concert, I ll go with Natalia.",
      "Well, good-bye.",
      "On the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma, who had been with him before his marriage, and now looked after their household in town.",
      "Beauty (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country) has been badly shod and is quite lame, he said.",
      "What does your honor wish to be done?",
      "During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own horses brought up from the country.",
      "He had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they still hired too.",
      "Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.",
      "And for Katerina Alexandrovna?",
      "asked Kouzma.",
      "Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours, paying five roubles every time.",
      "Now it seemed quite natural.",
      "Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster, said he.",
      "And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin settled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called a sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky.",
      "On the way he thought no more of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the Petersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him about his book.",
      "Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck by the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive but inevitable, that was expected of him on every side.",
      "But by now he had grown used to it.",
      "That had happened to him in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards the first glass sticks in the throat, the second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they re like tiny little birds.",
      "When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone but they were indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and Kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries, that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is, would pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash Wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat.",
      "But the next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations, that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown, this next one he parted with more easily.",
      "And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and they flew off like little birds.",
      "Whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed.",
      "His business calculation that there was a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain was forgotten too.",
      "The rye, for the price of which he had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago.",
      "Even the consideration that with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year without debt, that even had no force.",
      "Only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow.",
      "And this condition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in the bank.",
      "But now the money in the bank had gone, and he could not quite tell where to get the next installment.",
      "And this it was which, at the moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed him; but he had no time to think about it.",
      "He drove off, thinking of Katavasov and the meeting with Metrov that was before him.",
      "Chapter 3 Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at the university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his marriage.",
      "He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life.",
      "Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov s conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin s ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov s clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin s untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss.",
      "Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his book, and he had liked them.",
      "On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and told him that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much liked, was in Moscow, that he had been much interested by what Katavasov had told him about Levin s work, and that he was coming to see him tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin s acquaintance.",
      "You re positively a reformed character, I m glad to see, said Katavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing-room.",
      "I heard the bell and thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!...",
      "Well, what do you say to the Montenegrins now?",
      "They re a race of warriors.",
      "Why, what s happened?",
      "Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war, and going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of pleasant appearance.",
      "This was Metrov.",
      "The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg.",
      "Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers.",
      "Katavasov had heard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something quite different.",
      "Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped.",
      "Yes, here he s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land, said Katavasov; I m not a specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development.",
      "That s very interesting, said Metrov.",
      "What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer, said Levin, reddening, I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.",
      "And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound his views.",
      "He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally accepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could reckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could not guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.",
      "But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian laborer?",
      "said Metrov; in his biological characteristics, so to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?",
      "Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree.",
      "But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the East.",
      "One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people, said Metrov, interrupting Levin.",
      "The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital.",
      "And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory.",
      "In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because he did not take the trouble to understand.",
      "He saw that Metrov, like other people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and rent.",
      "He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern much the larger part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools.",
      "Yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer, though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.",
      "Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections.",
      "He would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov s theories superfluous.",
      "But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he did not even oppose his statements, but simply listened.",
      "Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him.",
      "It flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin s understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject.",
      "He put this down to his own credit, unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him, even if still obscure to himself.",
      "We are late though, said Katavasov, looking at his watch directly Metrov had finished his discourse.",
      "Yes, there s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch, said Katavasov in answer to Levin s inquiry.",
      "Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going.",
      "I ve promised to deliver an address on his labors in zoology.",
      "Come along with us, it s very interesting.",
      "Yes, and indeed it s time to start, said Metrov.",
      "Come with us, and from there, if you care to, come to my place.",
      "I should very much like to hear your work.",
      "It s no good yet, it s unfinished.",
      "But I shall be very glad to go to the meeting.",
      "I say, friends, have you heard?",
      "He has handed in the separate report, Katavasov called from the other room, where he was putting on his frock coat.",
      "And a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a very important event that winter in Moscow.",
      "Three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors.",
      "The young ones had registered a separate resolution.",
      "This, in the judgment of some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the simplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up into two parties.",
      "One party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a scoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in them childishness and lack of respect for the authorities.",
      "Levin, though he did not belong to the university, had several times already during his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had his own opinion on the subject.",
      "He took part in the conversation that was continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings of the old university.",
      "The meeting had already begun.",
      "Round the cloth-covered table, at which Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading something aloud.",
      "Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were standing round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near what was being read.",
      "The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said: Biography.",
      "Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science.",
      "When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some verses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet.",
      "Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept.",
      "When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past one, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so.",
      "During the reading he had thought over their conversation.",
      "He saw distinctly now that though Metrov s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas had a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together.",
      "And having made up his mind to refuse Metrov s invitation, Levin went up to him at the end of the meeting.",
      "Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom he was talking of the political news.",
      "Metrov told the chairman what he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his news that he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him.",
      "After that the conversation turned again on the university question.",
      "As Levin had already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and drove to Lvov s. Chapter 4 Lvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty s sister, had spent all his life in foreign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.",
      "During the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing to any unpleasantness (he never had any unpleasantness with anyone), and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in Moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education possible.",
      "In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one another that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.",
      "Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.",
      "Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.",
      "His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his curly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air, lighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.",
      "I was meaning to send to you.",
      "How s Kitty?",
      "Sit here, it s more comfortable.",
      "He got up and pushed up a rocking chair.",
      "Have you read the last circular in the _Journal de St. P tersbourg?_ I think it s excellent, he said, with a slight French accent.",
      "Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in Petersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of his interview with Metrov, and the learned society s meeting.",
      "To Lvov it was very interesting.",
      "That s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles, he said.",
      "And as he talked, he passed as usual into French, which was easier to him.",
      "It s true I haven t the time for it.",
      "My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I m not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.",
      "That I don t believe, said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always did, touched at Lvov s low opinion of himself, which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely sincere.",
      "Oh, yes, indeed!",
      "I feel now how badly educated I am.",
      "To educate my children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply to study myself.",
      "For it s not enough to have teachers, there must be someone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and an overseer.",
      "See what I m reading he pointed to Buslaev s _Grammar_ on the desk it s expected of Misha, and it s so difficult.... Come, explain to me....",
      "Here he says.... Levin tried to explain to him that it couldn t be understood, but that it had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.",
      "Oh, you re laughing at it!",
      "On the contrary, you can t imagine how, when I look at you, I m always learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one s children.",
      "Well, there s nothing for you to learn, said Lvov.",
      "All I know, said Levin, is that I have never seen better brought-up children than yours, and I wouldn t wish for children better than yours.",
      "Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he was positively radiant with smiles.",
      "If only they re better than I!",
      "That s all I desire.",
      "You don t know yet all the work, he said, with boys who ve been left like mine to run wild abroad.",
      "You ll catch all that up.",
      "They re such clever children.",
      "The great thing is the education of character.",
      "That s what I learn when I look at your children.",
      "You talk of the education of character.",
      "You can t imagine how difficult that is!",
      "You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency when others crop up, and the struggle begins again.",
      "If one had not a support in religion you remember we talked about that no father could bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.",
      "This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the entrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.",
      "I didn t know you were here, she said, unmistakably feeling no regret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a topic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it.",
      "Well, how is Kitty?",
      "I am dining with you today.",
      "I tell you what, Arseny, she turned to her husband, you take the carriage.",
      "And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the day.",
      "As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business, while the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a committee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider and settle.",
      "Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.",
      "It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the meeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the office for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty s; or that, if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage back and Levin would go with her.",
      "He s spoiling me, Lvov said to his wife; he assures me that our children are splendid, when I know how much that s bad there is in them.",
      "Arseny goes to extremes, I always say, said his wife.",
      "If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied.",
      "And it s true, as papa says, that when we were brought up there was one extreme we were kept in the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it s just the other way the parents are in the wash house, while the children are in the best rooms.",
      "Parents now are not expected to live at all, but to exist altogether for their children.",
      "Well, what if they like it better?",
      "Lvov said, with his beautiful smile, touching her hand.",
      "Anyone who didn t know you would think you were a stepmother, not a true mother.",
      "No, extremes are not good in anything, Natalia said serenely, putting his paper-knife straight in its proper place on the table.",
      "Well, come here, you perfect children, Lvov said to the two handsome boys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to their father, obviously wishing to ask him about something.",
      "Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to their father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov s colleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court uniform, to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town council, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.",
      "Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him.",
      "He recollected it as he was going into the hall.",
      "Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky, he said, as Lvov was standing on the stairs, seeing his wife and Levin off.",
      "Yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-fr res,_ to attack him, he said, blushing.",
      "But why should I?",
      "Well, then, I will attack him, said Madame Lvova, with a smile, standing in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished speaking.",
      "Come, let us go.",
      "Chapter 5 At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed.",
      "One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of Bach.",
      "Both were new and in the new style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them.",
      "After escorting his sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible.",
      "He tried not to let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music.",
      "He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him, listening.",
      "But the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it.",
      "There was, as it were, a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds.",
      "And these fragmentary musical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.",
      "Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection, like the emotions of a madman.",
      "And those emotions, like a madman s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.",
      "During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention.",
      "Loud applause resounded on all sides.",
      "Everyone got up, moved about, and began talking.",
      "Anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.",
      "Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass.",
      "How are you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch?",
      "Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia s approach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with fate.",
      "You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?",
      "Levin asked timidly, forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.",
      "Cordelia comes in ... see here!",
      "said Pestsov, tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to Levin.",
      "Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program.",
      "You can t follow it without that, said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as the person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to talk to.",
      "In the _entr acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the Wagner school.",
      "Levin maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal.",
      "These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder, said Levin.",
      "The comparison pleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.",
      "Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.",
      "The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear.",
      "Pestsov, who was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time, condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites in painting.",
      "As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.",
      "Among others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.",
      "Well, go at once then, Madame Lvova said, when he told her; perhaps they ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me.",
      "You ll find me still there.",
      "Chapter 6 Perhaps they re not at home?",
      "said Levin, as he went into the hall of Countess Bola s house.",
      "At home; please walk in, said the porter, resolutely removing his overcoat.",
      "How annoying!",
      "thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove and stroking his hat.",
      "What did I come for?",
      "What have I to say to them?",
      "As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway Countess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and severe face.",
      "On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the little drawing-room, where he heard voices.",
      "In this room there were sitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow colonel, whom Levin knew.",
      "Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down beside the sofa with his hat on his knees.",
      "How is your wife?",
      "Have you been at the concert?",
      "We couldn t go.",
      "Mamma had to be at the funeral service.",
      "Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!",
      "The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his wife and inquired about the concert.",
      "Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina s sudden death.",
      "But she was always in weak health.",
      "Were you at the opera yesterday?",
      "Yes, I was.",
      "Lucca was very good.",
      "Yes, very good, he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to him what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a hundred times about the characteristics of the singer s talent.",
      "Countess Bola pretended to be listening.",
      "Then, when he had said enough and paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk.",
      "The colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture.",
      "At last, after speaking of the proposed _folle journ e_ at Turin s, the colonel laughed, got up noisily, and went away.",
      "Levin too rose, but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go.",
      "He must stay two minutes longer.",
      "He sat down.",
      "But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.",
      "You are not going to the public meeting?",
      "They say it will be very interesting, began the countess.",
      "No, I promised my _belle-s ur_ to fetch her from it, said Levin.",
      "The mother once more exchanged glances with a daughter.",
      "Well, now I think the time has come, thought Levin, and he got up.",
      "The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _mille choses_ to his wife for them.",
      "The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat, Where is your honor staying?",
      "and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely bound book.",
      "Of course I don t care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid, thought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does it.",
      "He drove to the public meeting, where he was to find his sister-in-law, so as to drive home with her.",
      "At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people, and almost all the highest society.",
      "Levin was in time for the report which, as everyone said, was very interesting.",
      "When the reading of the report was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who invited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the Society of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and many other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various criticisms on the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial.",
      "But, probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times with vexation.",
      "Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance.",
      "I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by putting it into the water, said Levin.",
      "Then he recollected that this idea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own, came from a fable of Krilov s, and that the acquaintance had picked it up from a newspaper article.",
      "After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good spirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.",
      "Chapter 7 Levin reached the club just at the right time.",
      "Members and visitors were driving up as he arrived.",
      "Levin had not been at the club for a very long while not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the university and going into society.",
      "He remembered the club, the external details of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.",
      "But as soon as, driving into the wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted the steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf, noiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the porter s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less trouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the mysterious ringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy, carpeted staircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at the top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery, opening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as they passed in Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a rush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.",
      "Your hat, please, the porter said to Levin, who forgot the club rule to leave his hat in the porter s room.",
      "Long time since you ve been.",
      "The prince put your name down yesterday.",
      "Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is not here yet.",
      "The porter did not only know Levin, but also all his ties and relationships, and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends.",
      "Passing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room partitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin overtook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining-room full of noise and people.",
      "He walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the visitors.",
      "He saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he knew a little, some intimate friends.",
      "There was not a single cross or worried-looking face.",
      "All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties in the porter s room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting ready to enjoy the material blessings of life.",
      "Sviazhsky was here and Shtcherbatsky, Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "why are you late?",
      "the prince said smiling, and giving him his hand over his own shoulder.",
      "he added, smoothing out the napkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.",
      "All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.",
      "Ah, Aline-Nadine, to be sure!",
      "There s no room with us.",
      "Go to that table, and make haste and take a seat, said the prince, and turning away he carefully took a plate of eel soup.",
      "Levin, this way!",
      "a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on.",
      "It was Turovtsin.",
      "He was sitting with a young officer, and beside them were two chairs turned upside down.",
      "Levin gladly went up to them.",
      "He had always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin he was associated in his mind with memories of his courtship and at that moment, after the strain of intellectual conversation, the sight of Turovtsin s good-natured face was particularly welcome.",
      "For you and Oblonsky.",
      "He ll be here directly.",
      "The young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling with enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin.",
      "Turovtsin introduced them.",
      "Oblonsky s always late.",
      "Ah, here he is!",
      "Have you only just come?",
      "said Oblonsky, coming quickly towards them.",
      "Good day.",
      "Had some vodka?",
      "Well, come along then.",
      "Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and appetizers of the most various kinds.",
      "One would have thought that out of two dozen delicacies one might find something to one s taste, but Stepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the liveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required.",
      "They drank a wine-glassful and returned to their table.",
      "At once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with champagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses.",
      "Levin did not refuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle.",
      "He was very hungry, and ate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment took part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions.",
      "Gagin, dropping his voice, told the last good story from Petersburg, and the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin broke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.",
      "That s in the same style as, that s a thing I can t endure!",
      "You know the story?",
      "Ah, that s exquisite!",
      "Another bottle, he said to the waiter, and he began to relate his good story.",
      "Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him, a little old waiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate glasses of sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling.",
      "You met him once at my place, don t you remember?",
      "A good-natured fellow.",
      "Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s anecdote too was very amusing.",
      "Levin told his story, and that too was successful.",
      "Then they talked of horses, of the races, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly Vronsky s Atlas had won the first prize.",
      "Levin did not notice how the time passed at dinner.",
      "and here they are!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of dinner, leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to Vronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards.",
      "Vronsky s face too beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in the club.",
      "He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch s shoulder, whispering something to him, and he held out his hand to Levin with the same good-humored smile.",
      "Very glad to meet you, he said.",
      "I looked out for you at the election, but I was told you had gone away.",
      "Yes, I left the same day.",
      "We ve just been talking of your horse.",
      "I congratulate you, said Levin.",
      "It was very rapidly run.",
      "Yes; you ve race horses too, haven t you?",
      "No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.",
      "Where have you dined?",
      "We were at the second table, behind the columns.",
      "We ve been celebrating his success, said the tall colonel.",
      "It s his second Imperial prize.",
      "I wish I might have the luck at cards he has with horses.",
      "Well, why waste the precious time?",
      "I m going to the infernal regions, added the colonel, and he walked away.",
      "That s Yashvin, Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin, and he sat down in the vacated seat beside them.",
      "He drank the glass offered him, and ordered a bottle of wine.",
      "Under the influence of the club atmosphere or the wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds of cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to this man.",
      "He even told him, among other things, that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at Princess Marya Borissovna s. Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she s exquisite!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and he told an anecdote about her which set them all laughing.",
      "Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted amusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him.",
      "Well, have we finished?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up with a smile.",
      "Let us go.",
      "Chapter 8 Getting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty room to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he walked with a peculiar lightness and ease.",
      "As he crossed the big room, he came upon his father-in-law.",
      "Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?",
      "said the prince, taking his arm.",
      "Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything.",
      "It s interesting.",
      "Yes, it s interesting for you.",
      "But its interest for me is quite different.",
      "You look at those little old men now, he said, pointing to a club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling towards them in his soft boots, and imagine that they were _shlupiks_ like that from their birth up.",
      "How _shlupiks_?",
      "I see you don t know that name.",
      "That s our club designation.",
      "You know the game of rolling eggs: when one s rolled a long while it becomes a _shlupik_.",
      "So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club, and ends by becoming a _shlupik_.",
      "Ah, you laugh!",
      "but we look out, for fear of dropping into it ourselves.",
      "You know Prince Tchetchensky?",
      "inquired the prince; and Levin saw by his face that he was just going to relate something funny.",
      "No, I don t know him.",
      "Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure.",
      "No matter, though.",
      "He s always playing billiards here.",
      "Only three years ago he was not a _shlupik_ and kept up his spirits and even used to call other people _shlupiks_.",
      "But one day he turns up, and our porter ... you know Vassily?",
      "Why, that fat one; he s famous for his _bon mots_.",
      "And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him, Come, Vassily, who s here?",
      "Any _shlupiks_ here yet?",
      "And he says, You re the third.",
      "Yes, my dear boy, that he did!",
      "Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked through all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been set, and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan room, where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting talking to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a recess, there was a lively party drinking champagne Gagin was one of them.",
      "They peeped into the infernal regions, where a good many men were crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting.",
      "Trying not to make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under the shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance, turning over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a book.",
      "They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual room, where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the latest political news.",
      "Prince, please come, we re ready, said one of his card party, who had come to look for him, and the prince went off.",
      "Levin sat down and listened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all of a sudden fearfully bored.",
      "He got up hurriedly, and went to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.",
      "Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the farther corner of the room.",
      "It s not that she s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled position, Levin caught, and he was hurrying away, but Stepan Arkadyevitch called to him.",
      "Levin, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that his eyes were not full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he had been drinking, or when he was touched.",
      "Just now it was due to both causes.",
      "Levin, don t go, he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm above the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go.",
      "This is a true friend of mine almost my greatest friend, he said to Vronsky.",
      "You have become even closer and dearer to me.",
      "And I want you, and I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you re both splendid fellows.",
      "Well, there s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends, Vronsky said, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his hand.",
      "Levin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.",
      "I m very, very glad, said Levin.",
      "Waiter, a bottle of champagne, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And I m very glad, said Vronsky.",
      "But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch s desire, and their own desire, they had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.",
      "Do you know, he has never met Anna?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Vronsky.",
      "And I want above everything to take him to see her.",
      "Let us go, Levin!",
      "Really?",
      "She will be very glad to see you.",
      "I should be going home at once, he added, but I m worried about Yashvin, and I want to stay on till he finishes.",
      "Why, is he losing?",
      "He keeps losing, and I m the only friend that can restrain him.",
      "Well, what do you say to pyramids?",
      "Levin, will you play?",
      "Get the table ready, he said to the marker.",
      "It has been ready a long while, answered the marker, who had already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his own diversion.",
      "Well, let us begin.",
      "After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin s table, and at Stepan Arkadyevitch s suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.",
      "Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were incessantly coming up to him.",
      "Every now and then he went to the infernal to keep an eye on Yashvin.",
      "Levin was enjoying a delightful sense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning.",
      "He was glad that all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace, decorum, and comfort never left him.",
      "When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin s arm.",
      "Well, let us go to Anna s, then.",
      "At once?",
      "She is at home.",
      "I promised her long ago to bring you.",
      "Where were you meaning to spend the evening?",
      "Oh, nowhere specially.",
      "I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of Agriculture.",
      "By all means, let us go, said Levin.",
      "Very good; come along.",
      "Find out if my carriage is here, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to the waiter.",
      "Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; paid his bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by the little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his arms he walked through all the rooms to the way out.",
      "Chapter 9 Oblonsky s carriage!",
      "the porter shouted in an angry bass.",
      "The carriage drove up and both got in.",
      "It was only for the first few moments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates, that Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of repose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form.",
      "But as soon as the carriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.",
      "What would Kitty say?",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him no time for reflection, and, as though divining his doubts, he scattered them.",
      "How glad I am, he said, that you should know her!",
      "You know Dolly has long wished for it.",
      "And Lvov s been to see her, and often goes.",
      "Though she is my sister, Stepan Arkadyevitch pursued, I don t hesitate to say that she s a remarkable woman.",
      "But you will see.",
      "Her position is very painful, especially now.",
      "Why especially now?",
      "We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce.",
      "And he s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging on for three months past.",
      "As soon as the divorce is over, she will marry Vronsky.",
      "How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch put in.",
      "Well, then their position will be as regular as mine, as yours.",
      "What is the difficulty?",
      "Oh, it s a long and tedious story!",
      "The whole business is in such an anomalous position with us.",
      "But the point is she has been for three months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce; she goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you understand, she doesn t care to have people come as a favor.",
      "That fool Princess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of propriety.",
      "Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not have found resources in herself.",
      "But you ll see how she has arranged her life how calm, how dignified she is.",
      "To the left, in the crescent opposite the church!",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, leaning out of the window.",
      "Phew!",
      "how hot it is!",
      "he said, in spite of twelve degrees of frost, flinging his open overcoat still wider open.",
      "But she has a daughter: no doubt she s busy looking after her?",
      "I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, _une couveuse,_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "If she s occupied, it must be with her children.",
      "No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one doesn t hear about her.",
      "She s busy, in the first place, with what she writes.",
      "I see you re smiling ironically, but you re wrong.",
      "She s writing a children s book, and doesn t talk about it to anyone, but she read it to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ... you know the publisher ... and he s an author himself too, I fancy.",
      "He understands those things, and he says it s a remarkable piece of work.",
      "But are you fancying she s an authoress?",
      "not a bit of it.",
      "She s a woman with a heart, before everything, but you ll see.",
      "Now she has a little English girl with her, and a whole family she s looking after.",
      "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
      "Why, you will look at everything in the worst light.",
      "It s not from philanthropy, it s from the heart.",
      "They that is, Vronsky had a trainer, an Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard.",
      "He s completely given up to drink delirium tremens and the family were cast on the world.",
      "She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested in them, and now the whole family is on her hands.",
      "But not by way of patronage, you know, helping with money; she s herself preparing the boys in Russian for the high school, and she s taken the little girl to live with her.",
      "But you ll see her for yourself.",
      "The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang loudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.",
      "And without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady were at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall.",
      "Levin followed him, more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong.",
      "Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the face, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan Arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs.",
      "At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, who was with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M. Vorkuev.",
      "In the study.",
      "Passing through the dining-room, a room not very large, with dark, paneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft carpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big dark shade.",
      "Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall, lighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could not help looking at.",
      "It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by Mihailov.",
      "While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the _treillage_, and the man s voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the portrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown on it, and he could not tear himself away from it.",
      "He positively forgot where he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait.",
      "It was not a picture, but a living, charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders, with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly and softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him.",
      "She was not living only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.",
      "I am delighted!",
      "He heard suddenly near him a voice, unmistakably addressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the portrait.",
      "Anna had come from behind the _treillage_ to meet him, and Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait, in a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait.",
      "She was less dazzling in reality, but, on the other hand, there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman which was not in the portrait.",
      "Chapter 10 She had risen to meet him, not concealing her pleasure at seeing him; and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand, introduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed and natural.",
      "I am delighted, delighted, she repeated, and on her lips these simple words took for Levin s ears a special significance.",
      "I have known you and liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva and for your wife s sake....",
      "I knew her for a very short time, but she left on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower.",
      "And to think she will soon be a mother!",
      "She spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to her brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was making was good, and he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though he had known her from childhood.",
      "Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey s study, she said in answer to Stepan Arkadyevitch s question whether he might smoke, just so as to be able to smoke and glancing at Levin, instead of asking whether he would smoke, she pulled closer a tortoise-shell cigar-case and took a cigarette.",
      "her brother asked her.",
      "Nerves, as usual.",
      "Yes, isn t it extraordinarily fine?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, noticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.",
      "I have never seen a better portrait.",
      "And extraordinarily like, isn t it?",
      "said Vorkuev.",
      "Levin looked from the portrait to the original.",
      "A peculiar brilliance lighted up Anna s face when she felt his eyes on her.",
      "Levin flushed, and to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya Alexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke.",
      "We were just talking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov s last pictures.",
      "Have you seen them?",
      "Yes, I have seen them, answered Levin.",
      "But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were saying?...",
      "Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.",
      "She was here yesterday.",
      "She was very indignant with the high school people on Grisha s account.",
      "The Latin teacher, it seems, had been unfair to him.",
      "Yes, I have seen his pictures.",
      "I didn t care for them very much, Levin went back to the subject she had started.",
      "Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to the subject with which he had been talking all the morning.",
      "Every word in his conversation with her had a special significance.",
      "And talking to her was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.",
      "Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and carelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight to the ideas of the person she was talking to.",
      "The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new illustrations of the Bible by a French artist.",
      "Vorkuev attacked the artist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.",
      "Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than anyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to realism.",
      "In the fact of not lying they see poetry.",
      "Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as this remark.",
      "Anna s face lighted up at once, as at once she appreciated the thought.",
      "She laughed.",
      "I laugh, she said, as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.",
      "What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and literature too, indeed Zola, Daudet.",
      "But perhaps it is always so, that men form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and then all the _combinaisons_ made they are tired of the fictitious figures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.",
      "That s perfectly true, said Vorknev.",
      "So you ve been at the club?",
      "she said to her brother.",
      "Yes, yes, this is a woman!",
      "Levin thought, forgetting himself and staring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment was all at once completely transformed.",
      "Levin did not hear what she was talking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was struck by the change of her expression.",
      "Her face so handsome a moment before in its repose suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride.",
      "But this lasted only an instant.",
      "She dropped her eyelids, as though recollecting something.",
      "Oh, well, but that s of no interest to anyone, she said, and she turned to the English girl.",
      "Please order the tea in the drawing-room, she said in English.",
      "The girl got up and went out.",
      "Well, how did she get through her examination?",
      "Splendidly!",
      "She s a very gifted child and a sweet character.",
      "It will end in your loving her more than your own.",
      "There a man speaks.",
      "In love there s no more nor less.",
      "I love my daughter with one love, and her with another.",
      "I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna, said Vorkuev, that if she were to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl to the public question of the education of Russian children, she would be doing a great and useful work.",
      "Yes, but I can t help it; I couldn t do it.",
      "Count Alexey Kirillovitch urged me very much (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey Kirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he unconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look); he urged me to take up the school in the village.",
      "I visited it several times.",
      "The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the work.",
      "You speak of energy.",
      "Energy rests upon love; and come as it will, there s no forcing it.",
      "I took to this child I could not myself say why.",
      "And she glanced again at Levin.",
      "And her smile and her glance all told him that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his good opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood each other.",
      "I quite understand that, Levin answered.",
      "It s impossible to give one s heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe that s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor results.",
      "She was silent for a while, then she smiled.",
      "Yes, yes, she agreed; I never could.",
      "_Je n ai pas le c ur assez_ large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls.",
      "_Cela ne m a jamais r ussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une position sociale_ in that way.",
      "And now more than ever, she said with a mournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but unmistakably intending her words only for Levin, now when I have such need of some occupation, I cannot.",
      "And suddenly frowning (Levin saw that she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed the subject.",
      "I know about you, she said to Levin; that you re not a public-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my ability.",
      "How have you defended me?",
      "Oh, according to the attacks made on you.",
      "But won t you have some tea?",
      "She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.",
      "Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna, said Vorkuev, indicating the book.",
      "It s well worth taking up.",
      "Oh, no, it s all so sketchy.",
      "I told him about it, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his sister, nodding at Levin.",
      "You shouldn t have.",
      "My writing is something after the fashion of those little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from the prisons.",
      "She had the direction of the prison department in that society, she turned to Levin; and they were miracles of patience, the work of those poor wretches.",
      "And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so extraordinarily.",
      "Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth.",
      "She had no wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position.",
      "As she said that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression, looked as it were turned to stone.",
      "With that expression on her face she was more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was utterly unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating happiness, which had been caught by the painter in her portrait.",
      "Levin looked more than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her brother s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her a tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.",
      "She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room, while she stayed behind to say a few words to her brother.",
      "About her divorce, about Vronsky, and what he s doing at the club, about me?",
      "wondered Levin.",
      "And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was saying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely heard what Vorkuev was telling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna had written.",
      "At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter, continued.",
      "There was not a single instant when a subject for conversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had hardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear what the others were saying.",
      "And all that was said, not only by her, but by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch all, so it seemed to Levin, gained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.",
      "While he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time admiring her her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the same time her directness and genuine depth of feeling.",
      "He listened and talked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to divine her feelings.",
      "And though he had judged her so severely hitherto, now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was also sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand her.",
      "At eleven o clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go (Vorkuev had left earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just come.",
      "Regretfully Levin too rose.",
      "Good-bye, she said, holding his hand and glancing into his face with a winning look.",
      "I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._ She dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.",
      "Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot pardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never pardon it.",
      "To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through, and may God spare her that.",
      "Certainly, yes, I will tell her.... Levin said, blushing.",
      "Chapter 11 What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!",
      "he was thinking, as he stepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, didn t I tell you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin had been completely won over.",
      "Yes, said Levin dreamily, an extraordinary woman!",
      "It s not her cleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling.",
      "I m awfully sorry for her!",
      "Now, please God, everything will soon be settled.",
      "Well, well, don t be hard on people in future, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the carriage door.",
      "Good-bye; we don t go the same way.",
      "Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in their conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her expression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling sympathy for her, Levin reached home.",
      "At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well, and that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two letters.",
      "Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not overlook them later.",
      "One was from Sokolov, his bailiff.",
      "Sokolov wrote that the corn could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a half roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it.",
      "The other letter was from his sister.",
      "She scolded him for her business being still unsettled.",
      "Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can t get more, Levin decided the first question, which had always before seemed such a weighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot.",
      "It s extraordinary how all one s time is taken up here, he thought, considering the second letter.",
      "He felt himself to blame for not having got done what his sister had asked him to do for her.",
      "Today, again, I ve not been to the court, but today I ve certainly not had time.",
      "And resolving that he would not fail to do it next day, he went up to his wife.",
      "As he went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had spent.",
      "All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he had heard and taken part in.",
      "All the conversations were upon subjects which, if he had been alone at home, he would never have taken up, but here they were very interesting.",
      "And all these conversations were right enough, only in two places there was something not quite right.",
      "One was what he had said about the carp, the other was something not quite the thing in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.",
      "Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull.",
      "The dinner of the three sisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for him, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had been left alone.",
      "Well, and what have you been doing?",
      "she asked him, looking straight into his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness.",
      "But that she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed her close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his account of how he had spent the evening.",
      "Well, I m very glad I met Vronsky.",
      "I felt quite at ease and natural with him.",
      "You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I m glad that this awkwardness is all over, he said, and remembering that by way of trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he blushed.",
      "We talk about the peasants drinking; I don t know which drinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays, but....",
      "But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking habits of the peasants.",
      "She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know why.",
      "Well, and then where did you go?",
      "Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "And as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to whether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for all.",
      "He knew now that he ought not to have done so.",
      "Kitty s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna s name, but controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and deceived him.",
      "was all she said.",
      "I m sure you won t be angry at my going.",
      "Stiva begged me to, and Dolly wished it, Levin went on.",
      "she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him no good.",
      "She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman, he said, telling her about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to her.",
      "Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied, said Kitty, when he had finished.",
      "Whom was your letter from?",
      "He told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his coat.",
      "Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair.",
      "When he went up to her, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.",
      "he asked, knowing beforehand what.",
      "You re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you!",
      "I saw it in your eyes.",
      "What can it all lead to?",
      "You were drinking at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to her of all people!",
      "No, we must go away....",
      "I shall go away tomorrow.",
      "It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife.",
      "At last he succeeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in conjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that he had succumbed to Anna s artful influence, and that he would avoid her.",
      "One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so long in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and drinking, he was degenerating.",
      "They talked till three o clock in the morning.",
      "Only at three o clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be able to go to sleep.",
      "Chapter 12 After taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began walking up and down the room.",
      "She had unconsciously the whole evening done her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love as of late she had fallen into doing with all young men and she knew she had attained her aim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and conscientious man.",
      "She liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of the striking difference, from the masculine point of view, between Vronsky and Levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had made Kitty able to love both.",
      "Yet as soon as he was out of the room, she ceased to think of him.",
      "One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused to be shaken off.",
      "If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who loves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?...",
      "not cold exactly, he loves me, I know that!",
      "But something new is drawing us apart now.",
      "Why wasn t he here all the evening?",
      "He told Stiva to say he could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play.",
      "Is Yashvin a child?",
      "But supposing it s true.",
      "He never tells a lie.",
      "But there s something else in it if it s true.",
      "He is glad of an opportunity of showing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that.",
      "But why prove that to me?",
      "He wants to show me that his love for me is not to interfere with his freedom.",
      "But I need no proofs, I need love.",
      "He ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in Moscow.",
      "Is this life?",
      "I am not living, but waiting for an event, which is continually put off and put off.",
      "No answer again!",
      "And Stiva says he cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And I can t write again.",
      "I can do nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I wait, inventing amusements for myself the English family, writing, reading but it s all nothing but a sham, it s all the same as morphine.",
      "He ought to feel for me, she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her eyes.",
      "She heard Vronsky s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears not only dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting composure.",
      "She wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had not come home as he had promised displeased only, and not on any account to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity.",
      "She might pity herself, but he must not pity her.",
      "She did not want strife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an attitude of antagonism.",
      "Well, you ve not been dull?",
      "he said, eagerly and good-humoredly, going up to her.",
      "What a terrible passion it is gambling!",
      "No, I ve not been dull; I ve learned long ago not to be dull.",
      "Stiva has been here and Levin.",
      "Yes, they meant to come and see you.",
      "Well, how did you like Levin?",
      "he said, sitting down beside her.",
      "They have not long been gone.",
      "What was Yashvin doing?",
      "He was winning seventeen thousand.",
      "I got him away.",
      "He had really started home, but he went back again, and now he s losing.",
      "Then what did you stay for?",
      "she asked, suddenly lifting her eyes to him.",
      "The expression of her face was cold and ungracious.",
      "You told Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away.",
      "And you have left him there.",
      "The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his face too.",
      "In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; and secondly, I never tell lies.",
      "But what s the chief point, I wanted to stay, and I stayed, he said, frowning.",
      "Anna, what is it for, why will you?",
      "he said after a moment s silence, bending over towards her, and he opened his hand, hoping she would lay hers in it.",
      "She was glad of this appeal for tenderness.",
      "But some strange force of evil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, as though the rules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.",
      "Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed.",
      "You do everything you want to.",
      "But what do you tell me that for?",
      "she said, getting more and more excited.",
      "Does anyone contest your rights?",
      "But you want to be right, and you re welcome to be right.",
      "His hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more obstinate expression.",
      "For you it s a matter of obstinacy, she said, watching him intently and suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated her, simply obstinacy.",
      "For you it s a question of whether you keep the upper hand of me, while for me.... Again she felt sorry for herself, and she almost burst into tears.",
      "If you knew what it is for me!",
      "When I feel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew what this means for me!",
      "If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity at this instant, how afraid I am of myself!",
      "And she turned away, hiding her sobs.",
      "But what are you talking about?",
      "he said, horrified at her expression of despair, and again bending over her, he took her hand and kissed it.",
      "What is it for?",
      "Do I seek amusements outside our home?",
      "Don t I avoid the society of women?",
      "Well, yes!",
      "If that were all!",
      "Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind?",
      "I am ready to do anything to make you happy, he said, touched by her expression of despair; what wouldn t I do to save you from distress of any sort, as now, Anna!",
      "It s nothing, nothing!",
      "I don t know myself whether it s the solitary life, my nerves.... Come, don t let us talk of it.",
      "What about the race?",
      "You haven t told me!",
      "she inquired, trying to conceal her triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her side.",
      "He asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; but in his tone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, she saw that he did not forgive her for her victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with which she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him.",
      "He was colder to her than before, as though he were regretting his surrender.",
      "And she, remembering the words that had given her the victory, how I feel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself, saw that this weapon was a dangerous one, and that it could not be used a second time.",
      "And she felt that beside the love that bound them together there had grown up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she could not exorcise from his, and still less from her own heart.",
      "Chapter 13 There are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially if he sees that all around him are living in the same way.",
      "Levin could not have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly to sleep in the condition in which he was that day, that leading an aimless, irrational life, living too beyond his means, after drinking to excess (he could not call what happened at the club anything else), forming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his wife had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a woman who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by that woman and causing his wife distress he could still go quietly to sleep.",
      "But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the wine he had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.",
      "At five o clock the creak of a door opening waked him.",
      "He jumped up and looked round.",
      "Kitty was not in bed beside him.",
      "But there was a light moving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.",
      "What is it?...",
      "he said, half-asleep.",
      "Nothing, she said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her hand.",
      "I felt unwell, she said, smiling a particularly sweet and meaning smile.",
      "has it begun?",
      "he said in terror.",
      "We ought to send.... and hurriedly he reached after his clothes.",
      "No, no, she said, smiling and holding his hand.",
      "It s sure to be nothing.",
      "I was rather unwell, only a little.",
      "It s all over now.",
      "And getting into bed, she blew out the candle, lay down and was still.",
      "Though he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding her breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar tenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the screen, she said nothing, he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once.",
      "Only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing, and understood all that must have been passing in her sweet, precious heart while she lay beside him, not stirring, in anticipation of the greatest event in a woman s life.",
      "At seven o clock he was waked by the touch of her hand on his shoulder, and a gentle whisper.",
      "She seemed struggling between regret at waking him, and the desire to talk to him.",
      "Kostya, don t be frightened.",
      "It s all right.",
      "But I fancy.... We ought to send for Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "The candle was lighted again.",
      "She was sitting up in bed, holding some knitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.",
      "Please, don t be frightened, it s all right.",
      "I m not a bit afraid, she said, seeing his scared face, and she pressed his hand to her bosom and then to her lips.",
      "He hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her, as he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her.",
      "He had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes.",
      "He thought he loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen it like this.",
      "How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking of the distress he had caused her yesterday.",
      "Her flushed face, fringed with soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and courage.",
      "Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty s character in general, Levin was struck by what was revealed now, when suddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul shone in her eyes.",
      "And in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul, she, the very woman he loved in her, was more manifest than ever.",
      "She looked at him, smiling; but all at once her brows twitched, she threw up her head, and going quickly up to him, clutched his hand and pressed close up to him, breathing her hot breath upon him.",
      "She was in pain and was, as it were, complaining to him of her suffering.",
      "And for the first minute, from habit, it seemed to him that he was to blame.",
      "But in her eyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from reproaching him, that she loved him for her sufferings.",
      "If not I, who is to blame for it?",
      "he thought unconsciously, seeking someone responsible for this suffering for him to punish; but there was no one responsible.",
      "She was suffering, complaining, and triumphing in her sufferings, and rejoicing in them, and loving them.",
      "He saw that something sublime was being accomplished in her soul, but what?",
      "He could not make it out.",
      "It was beyond his understanding.",
      "I have sent to mamma.",
      "You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...",
      "Kostya!...",
      "Nothing, it s over.",
      "She moved away from him and rang the bell.",
      "Well, go now; Pasha s coming.",
      "I am all right.",
      "And Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she had brought in in the night and begun working at it again.",
      "As Levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in at the other.",
      "He stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact directions to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.",
      "He dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired sledge was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on tiptoe, it seemed to him, but on wings.",
      "Two maid-servants were carefully moving something in the bedroom.",
      "Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.",
      "I m going for the doctor.",
      "They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but I ll go on there too.",
      "Isn t there anything wanted?",
      "Yes, shall I go to Dolly s?",
      "She looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.",
      "Do go, she said quickly, frowning and waving her hand to him.",
      "He had just gone into the drawing-room, when suddenly a plaintive moan sounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly.",
      "He stood still, and for a long while he could not understand.",
      "Yes, that is she, he said to himself, and clutching at his head he ran downstairs.",
      "Lord have mercy on us!",
      "pardon us!",
      "aid us!",
      "he repeated the words that for some reason came suddenly to his lips.",
      "And he, an unbeliever, repeated these words not with his lips only.",
      "At that instant he knew that all his doubts, even the impossibility of believing with his reason, of which he was aware in himself, did not in the least hinder his turning to God.",
      "All of that now floated out of his soul like dust.",
      "To whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself, his soul, and his love?",
      "The horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of his physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do, he started off on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake him.",
      "At the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly.",
      "In the little sledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a kerchief round her head.",
      "he said, overjoyed to recognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even stern expression.",
      "Telling the driver not to stop, he ran along beside her.",
      "For two hours, then?",
      "Not more?",
      "she inquired.",
      "You should let Pyotr Dmitrievitch know, but don t hurry him.",
      "And get some opium at the chemist s. So you think that it may go on well?",
      "Lord have mercy on us and help us!",
      "Levin said, seeing his own horse driving out of the gate.",
      "Jumping into the sledge beside Kouzma, he told him to drive to the doctor s. Chapter 14 The doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that he had been up late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.",
      "The footman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very busy about them.",
      "This concentration of the footman upon his lamps, and his indifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him, but immediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or was bound to know his feelings, and that it was all the more necessary to act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this wall of indifference and attain his aim.",
      "Don t be in a hurry or let anything slip, Levin said to himself, feeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to all that lay before him to do.",
      "Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered various plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go for another doctor, while he himself should go to the chemist s for opium, and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up, he would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor at all hazards.",
      "At the chemist s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a coachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the same callousness with which the doctor s footman had cleaned his lamp chimneys.",
      "Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned the names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was needed for, tried to persuade him.",
      "The assistant inquired in German whether he should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from behind the partition, he took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately poured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a label, sealed it up, in spite of Levin s request that he would not do so, and was about to wrap it up too.",
      "This was more than Levin could stand; he took the bottle firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big glass doors.",
      "The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman, busy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him.",
      "Levin deliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly, though losing no time over the business, he handed him the note, and explained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch (what a great and important personage he seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so little consequence in his eyes before!)",
      "had promised to come at any time; that he would certainly not be angry!",
      "and that he must therefore wake him at once.",
      "The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting room.",
      "Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about, washing, and saying something.",
      "Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin that more than an hour had gone by.",
      "He could not wait any longer.",
      "Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!",
      "he said in an imploring voice at the open door.",
      "For God s sake, forgive me!",
      "See me as you are.",
      "It s been going on more than two hours already.",
      "In a minute; in a minute!",
      "answered a voice, and to his amazement Levin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.",
      "For one instant.",
      "In a minute.",
      "Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots, and two minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.",
      "Pyotr Dmitrievitch!",
      "Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice, just as the doctor came in dressed and ready.",
      "These people have no conscience, thought Levin.",
      "Combing his hair, while we re dying!",
      "Good morning!",
      "the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and, as it were, teasing him with his composure.",
      "There s no hurry.",
      "Well now?",
      "Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him every unnecessary detail of his wife s condition, interrupting his account repeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once.",
      "Oh, you needn t be in any hurry.",
      "You don t understand, you know.",
      "I m certain I m not wanted, still I ve promised, and if you like, I ll come.",
      "But there s no hurry.",
      "Please sit down; won t you have some coffee?",
      "Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at him; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.",
      "I know, I know, the doctor said, smiling; I m a married man myself; and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied.",
      "I ve a patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such occasions.",
      "But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch?",
      "Do you suppose it may go all right?",
      "Everything points to a favorable issue.",
      "So you ll come immediately?",
      "said Levin, looking wrathfully at the servant who was bringing in the coffee.",
      "In an hour s time.",
      "Oh, for mercy s sake!",
      "Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.",
      "The doctor started upon his coffee.",
      "Both were silent.",
      "The Turks are really getting beaten, though.",
      "Did you read yesterday s telegrams?",
      "said the doctor, munching some roll.",
      "No, I can t stand it!",
      "So you ll be with us in a quarter of an hour.",
      "In half an hour.",
      "On your honor?",
      "When Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the princess, and they went up to the bedroom door together.",
      "The princess had tears in her eyes, and her hands were shaking.",
      "Seeing Levin, she embraced him, and burst into tears.",
      "Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?",
      "she queried, clasping the hand of the midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face.",
      "She s going on well, she said; persuade her to lie down.",
      "She will be easier so.",
      "From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on, Levin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him, and without considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his wife, and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage.",
      "Without allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it would end, judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals, Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to him he could do this.",
      "But when he came back from the doctor s and saw her sufferings again, he fell to repeating more and more frequently: Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!",
      "He sighed, and flung his head up, and began to feel afraid he could not bear it, that he would burst into tears or run away.",
      "Such agony it was to him.",
      "And only one hour had passed.",
      "But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the full five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings, and the position was still unchanged; and he was still bearing it because there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling that he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance, and that his heart would break with sympathy and pain.",
      "But still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more, and his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.",
      "All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no conception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin.",
      "He lost all sense of time.",
      "Minutes those minutes when she sent for him and he held her moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence and then push it away seemed to him hours, and hours seemed to him minutes.",
      "He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him to light a candle behind a screen, and he found that it was five o clock in the afternoon.",
      "If he had been told it was only ten o clock in the morning, he would not have been more surprised.",
      "Where he was all this time, he knew as little as the time of anything.",
      "He saw her swollen face, sometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to reassure him.",
      "He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her tears, biting her lips; he saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat cigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring face, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning face.",
      "But why they came in and went out, where they were, he did not know.",
      "The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the study, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not there, but Dolly was.",
      "Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere.",
      "Once he had been sent to move a table and sofa.",
      "He had done this eagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he found it was his own bed he had been getting ready.",
      "Then he had been sent to the study to ask the doctor something.",
      "The doctor had answered and then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal council.",
      "Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess to move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the princess s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and had broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to reassure him about the lamp and about his wife, and he carried the holy picture and set it at Kitty s head, carefully tucking it in behind the pillow.",
      "But where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not tell.",
      "He did not understand why the old princess took his hand, and looking compassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, and Dolly persuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room, and even the doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered him a drop of something.",
      "All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother Nikolay.",
      "But that had been grief this was joy.",
      "Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime.",
      "And in the contemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to inconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while reason lagged behind, unable to keep up with it.",
      "Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!",
      "he repeated to himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth.",
      "All this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions.",
      "One was away from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about politics, about Marya Petrovna s illness, and where Levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing.",
      "And every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the first minute.",
      "Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped up, ran to justify himself, remembered on the way that he was not to blame, and he longed to defend her, to help her.",
      "But as he looked at her, he saw again that help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed: Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!",
      "And as time went on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he became away from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them.",
      "He jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her.",
      "Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, I am worrying you, he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell to beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy.",
      "Chapter 15 He did not know whether it was late or early.",
      "The candles had all burned out.",
      "Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he should lie down.",
      "Levin sat listening to the doctor s stories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his cigarette.",
      "There had been a period of repose, and he had sunk into oblivion.",
      "He had completely forgotten what was going on now.",
      "He heard the doctor s chat and understood it.",
      "Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek.",
      "The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but holding his breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor.",
      "The doctor put his head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.",
      "Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as strange.",
      "I suppose it must be so, he thought, and still sat where he was.",
      "Whose scream was this?",
      "He jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom, edged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his position at Kitty s pillow.",
      "The scream had subsided, but there was some change now.",
      "What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see or comprehend.",
      "But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "Lizaveta Petrovna s face was stern and pale, and still as resolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed intently on Kitty.",
      "Kitty s swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair clinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes.",
      "Her lifted hands asked for his hands.",
      "Clutching his chill hands in her moist ones, she began squeezing them to her face.",
      "Don t go, don t go!",
      "I m not afraid, I m not afraid!",
      "she said rapidly.",
      "Mamma, take my earrings.",
      "They bother me.",
      "You re not afraid?",
      "Quick, quick, Lizaveta Petrovna.... She spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile.",
      "But suddenly her face was drawn, she pushed him away.",
      "Oh, this is awful!",
      "I m dying, I m dying!",
      "Go away!",
      "she shrieked, and again he heard that unearthly scream.",
      "Levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.",
      "It s nothing, it s nothing, it s all right, Dolly called after him.",
      "But they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over.",
      "He stood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and heard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew that what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks.",
      "He had long ago ceased to wish for the child.",
      "By now he loathed this child.",
      "He did not even wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful anguish.",
      "Doctor!",
      "By God!",
      "he said, snatching at the doctor s hand as he came up.",
      "It s the end, said the doctor.",
      "And the doctor s face was so grave as he said it that Levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.",
      "Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom.",
      "The first thing he saw was the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "It was even more frowning and stern.",
      "Kitty s face he did not know.",
      "In the place where it had been was something that was fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from it.",
      "He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed, feeling that his heart was bursting.",
      "The awful scream never paused, it became still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit of terror, suddenly it ceased.",
      "Levin could not believe his ears, but there could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued stir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive, tender, and blissful, uttered softly, It s over!",
      "He lifted his head.",
      "With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt, looking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence and tried to smile, and could not.",
      "And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he had been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all in an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though now, by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it.",
      "The strained chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never foreseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for long they prevented him from speaking.",
      "Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife s hand before his lips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers, responded to his kiss.",
      "And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in the deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp, lay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and which would now with the same right, with the same importance to itself, live and create in its own image.",
      "Alive!",
      "And a boy too!",
      "Set your mind at rest!",
      "Levin heard Lizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby s back with a shaking hand.",
      "Mamma, is it true?",
      "said Kitty s voice.",
      "The princess s sobs were all the answers she could make.",
      "And in the midst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother s question, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.",
      "It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human being, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.",
      "If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died with her, and that their children were angels, and that God was standing before him, he would have been surprised at nothing.",
      "But now, coming back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental efforts to take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature squalling so desperately was his son.",
      "Kitty was alive, her agony was over.",
      "And he was unutterably happy.",
      "That he understood; he was completely happy in it.",
      "But the baby?",
      "Whence, why, who was he?...",
      "He could not get used to the idea.",
      "It seemed to him something extraneous, superfluous, to which he could not accustom himself.",
      "Chapter 16 At ten o clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan Arkadyevitch were sitting at Levin s. Having inquired after Kitty, they had dropped into conversation upon other subjects.",
      "Levin heard them, and unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had been up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been yesterday till that point.",
      "It was as though a hundred years had passed since then.",
      "He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he studiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking to.",
      "He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her condition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school himself into believing.",
      "The whole world of woman, which had taken for him since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before, was now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination.",
      "He heard them talk of yesterday s dinner at the club, and thought: What is happening with her now?",
      "Is she asleep?",
      "What is she thinking of?",
      "Is he crying, my son Dmitri?",
      "And in the middle of the conversation, in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out of the room.",
      "Send me word if I can see her, said the prince.",
      "Very well, in a minute, answered Levin, and without stopping, he went to her room.",
      "She was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, making plans about the christening.",
      "Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap with some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her back.",
      "Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to her.",
      "Her face, bright before, brightened still more as he drew near her.",
      "There was the same change in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the dead.",
      "But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome.",
      "Again a rush of emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child s birth, flooded his heart.",
      "She took his hand and asked him if he had slept.",
      "He could not answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.",
      "I have had a nap, Kostya!",
      "she said to him; and I am so comfortable now.",
      "She looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed.",
      "Give him to me, she said, hearing the baby s cry.",
      "Give him to me, Lizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.",
      "To be sure, his papa shall look at him, said Lizaveta Petrovna, getting up and bringing something red, and queer, and wriggling.",
      "Wait a minute, we ll make him tidy first, and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something.",
      "Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to discover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it.",
      "He felt nothing towards it but disgust.",
      "But when it was undressed and he caught a glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with little toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from the rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open little hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into linen garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and such terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.",
      "Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.",
      "Don t be frightened, don t be frightened!",
      "When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll, Lizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and stood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.",
      "Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off the baby.",
      "Give him to me!",
      "she said, and even made as though she would sit up.",
      "What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn t move like that!",
      "I ll give him to you.",
      "Here we re showing papa what a fine fellow we are!",
      "And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head, lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes.",
      "But it had a nose, too, and slanting eyes and smacking lips.",
      "A splendid baby!",
      "said Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "Levin sighed with mortification.",
      "This splendid baby excited in him no feeling but disgust and compassion.",
      "It was not at all the feeling he had looked forward to.",
      "He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed breast.",
      "Suddenly laughter made him look round.",
      "The baby had taken the breast.",
      "Come, that s enough, that s enough!",
      "said Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty would not let the baby go.",
      "He fell asleep in her arms.",
      "Look, now, said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could see it.",
      "The aged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby sneezed.",
      "Smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his wife and went out of the dark room.",
      "What he felt towards this little creature was utterly unlike what he had expected.",
      "There was nothing cheerful and joyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of apprehension.",
      "It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to pain.",
      "And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest this helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented him from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride that he had felt when the baby sneezed.",
      "Chapter 17 Stepan Arkadyevitch s affairs were in a very bad way.",
      "The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and he had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount, almost all the remaining third.",
      "The merchant would not give more, especially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter insisting on her right to her own property, had refused to sign the receipt for the payment of the last third of the forest.",
      "All his salary went on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not be put off.",
      "There was positively no money.",
      "This was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch s opinion things could not go on like this.",
      "The explanation of the position was, in his view, to be found in the fact that his salary was too small.",
      "The post he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago, but it was so no longer.",
      "Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company director, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank, received fifty thousand.",
      "Clearly I ve been napping, and they ve overlooked me, Stepan Arkadyevitch thought about himself.",
      "And he began keeping his eyes and ears open, and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very good berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the matter was well advanced, in the spring, he went himself to Petersburg.",
      "It was one of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many more nowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one thousand to fifty thousand roubles.",
      "It was the post of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of certain banking companies.",
      "This position, like all such appointments, called for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it was difficult for them to be found united in any one man.",
      "And since a man combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at least better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest man.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest man unemphatically in the common acceptation of the words, he was an honest man emphatically in that special sense which the word has in Moscow, when they talk of an honest politician, an honest writer, an honest newspaper, an honest institution, an honest tendency, meaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest, but that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in opposition to the authorities.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that expression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and so had more right to this appointment than others.",
      "The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year, and Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position.",
      "It was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all these people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan Arkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg.",
      "Besides this business, Stepan Arkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a definite answer on the question of divorce.",
      "And begging fifty roubles from Dolly, he set off for Petersburg.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin s study listening to his report on the causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and only waiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own business or about Anna.",
      "Yes, that s very true, he said, when Alexey Alexandrovitch took off the pince-nez, without which he could not read now, and looked inquiringly at his former brother-in-law, that s very true in particular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.",
      "Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of freedom, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word embracing, and he put on his pince-nez again, so as to read the passage in which this statement was made.",
      "And turning over the beautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch read aloud over again the conclusive passage.",
      "I don t advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for the public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally, he said, looking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky.",
      "But _they_ cannot grasp that, _they_ are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by phrases.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what _they_ were doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his report and were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming near the end.",
      "And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of free-trade, and fully agreed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, thoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript.",
      "Oh, by the way, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, I wanted to ask you, some time when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I should be very glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he coveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new committee, and pondered.",
      "He was considering whether the new committee would not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been advocating.",
      "But as the influence of the new committee was of a very complex nature, and his views were of very wide application, he could not decide this straight off, and taking off his pince-nez, he said: Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason precisely for wishing to obtain the appointment?",
      "It s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means.... Nine thousand!",
      "repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he frowned.",
      "The high figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side Stepan Arkadyevitch s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of his own projects of reform, which always leaned towards economy.",
      "I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject, that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound economic _assiette_ of our finances.",
      "Suppose a bank director gets ten thousand well, he s worth it; or an engineer gets twenty thousand after all, it s a growing thing, you know!",
      "I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought to conform with the law of supply and demand.",
      "If the salary is fixed without any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two engineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and efficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special qualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense salaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with the law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest.",
      "And this is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts injuriously on the government service.",
      "I consider.... Stepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.",
      "Yes; but you must agree that it s a new institution of undoubted utility that s being started.",
      "After all, you know, it s a growing thing!",
      "What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on honestly, said Stepan Arkadyevitch with emphasis.",
      "But the Moscow significance of the word honest was lost on Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Honesty is only a negative qualification, he said.",
      "Well, you ll do me a great service, anyway, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, by putting in a word to Pomorsky just in the way of conversation....",
      "But I fancy it s more in Volgarinov s hands, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he s concerned, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, turning red.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention of that name, because he had been that morning at the Jew Volgarinov s, and the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in which he was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and honest public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had intentionally, beyond a doubt kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his waiting room, he had suddenly felt uneasy.",
      "Whether he was uncomfortable that he, a descendant of Rurik, Prince Oblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for the first time in his life he was not following the example of his ancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new career, anyway he was very uncomfortable.",
      "During those two hours in Volgarinov s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily about the room, pulling his whiskers, entering into conversation with the other petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his position, assiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling he was experiencing.",
      "But all the time he was uncomfortable and angry, he could not have said why whether because he could not get his epigram just right, or from some other reason.",
      "When at last Volgarinov had received him with exaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation, and had all but refused the favor asked of him, Stepan Arkadyevitch had made haste to forget it all as soon as possible.",
      "And now, at the mere recollection, he blushed.",
      "Chapter 18 Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.",
      "About Anna, Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief space, and shaking off the unpleasant impression.",
      "As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna s name, the face of Alexey Alexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of it, and it looked weary and dead.",
      "What is it exactly that you want from me?",
      "he said, moving in his chair and snapping his pince-nez.",
      "A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of the position.",
      "I m appealing to you ( not as an injured husband, Stepan Arkadyevitch was going to say, but afraid of wrecking his negotiation by this, he changed the words) not as a statesman (which did not sound _ propos_), but simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a Christian.",
      "You must have pity on her, he said.",
      "That is, in what way precisely?",
      "Karenin said softly.",
      "Yes, pity on her.",
      "If you had seen her as I have!",
      "I have been spending all the winter with her you would have pity on her.",
      "Her position is awful, simply awful!",
      "I had imagined, answered Alexey Alexandrovitch in a higher, almost shrill voice, that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she had desired for herself.",
      "Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven s sake, don t let us indulge in recriminations!",
      "What is past is past, and you know what she wants and is waiting for divorce.",
      "But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a condition to leave me my son.",
      "I replied in that sense, and supposed that the matter was ended.",
      "I consider it at an end, shrieked Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "But, for heaven s sake, don t get hot!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his brother-in-law s knee.",
      "The matter is not ended.",
      "If you will allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you were as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her everything freedom, divorce even.",
      "She appreciated that.",
      "No, don t think that.",
      "She did appreciate it to such a degree that at the first moment, feeling how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not consider everything.",
      "She gave up everything.",
      "But experience, time, have shown that her position is unbearable, impossible.",
      "The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me, Alexey Alexandrovitch put in, lifting his eyebrows.",
      "Allow me to disbelieve that, Stepan Arkadyevitch replied gently.",
      "Her position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever.",
      "She has deserved it, you will say.",
      "She knows that and asks you for nothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you.",
      "But I, all of us, her relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you.",
      "Why should she suffer?",
      "Who is any the better for it?",
      "Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party, observed Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Oh, no, oh, no, not at all!",
      "please understand me, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feeling sure this physical contact would soften his brother-in-law.",
      "All I say is this: her position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you, and you will lose nothing by it.",
      "I will arrange it all for you, so that you ll not notice it.",
      "You did promise it, you know.",
      "The promise was given before.",
      "And I had supposed that the question of my son had settled the matter.",
      "Besides, I had hoped that Anna Arkadyevna had enough generosity.... Alexey Alexandrovitch articulated with difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white.",
      "She leaves it all to your generosity.",
      "She begs, she implores one thing of you to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is placed.",
      "She does not ask for her son now.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are a good man.",
      "Put yourself in her position for a minute.",
      "The question of divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death.",
      "If you had not promised it once, she would have reconciled herself to her position, she would have gone on living in the country.",
      "But you promised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow.",
      "And here she s been for six months in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to the heart, every day expecting an answer.",
      "Why, it s like keeping a condemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck, promising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy.",
      "Have pity on her, and I will undertake to arrange everything.",
      "_Vos scrupules_....",
      "I am not talking about that, about that.... Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted with disgust.",
      "But, perhaps, I promised what I had no right to promise.",
      "So you go back from your promise?",
      "I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time to consider how much of what I promised is possible.",
      "cried Oblonsky, jumping up, I won t believe that!",
      "She s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be, and you cannot refuse in such.... As much of what I promised as is possible.",
      "_Vous professez d tre libre penseur._ But I as a believer cannot, in a matter of such gravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.",
      "But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I m aware, divorce is allowed, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Divorce is sanctioned even by our church.",
      "And we see....",
      "It is allowed, but not in the sense.... Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself, said Oblonsky, after a brief pause.",
      "Wasn t it you (and didn t we all appreciate it in you?)",
      "who forgave everything, and moved simply by Christian feeling was ready to make any sacrifice?",
      "You said yourself: if a man take thy coat, give him thy cloak also, and now....",
      "I beg, said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting suddenly onto his feet, his face white and his jaws twitching, I beg you to drop this ... to drop ... this subject!",
      "Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment; but like a messenger I have simply performed the commission given me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, pondered a little, and said: I must think it over and seek for guidance.",
      "The day after tomorrow I will give you a final answer, he said, after considering a moment.",
      "Chapter 19 Stepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to announce: Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "Who s Sergey Alexyevitch?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was beginning, but he remembered immediately.",
      "Ah, Seryozha!",
      "he said aloud.",
      "Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "I thought it was the director of a department.",
      "Anna asked me to see him too, he thought.",
      "And he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna had said to him at parting: Anyway, you will see him.",
      "Find out exactly where he is, who is looking after him.",
      "And Stiva ... if it were possible!",
      "Could it be possible?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that if it were possible, if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let her have her son.... Stepan Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to dream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single word about her.",
      "He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we had not foreseen, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Indeed, we feared for his life.",
      "But with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the summer, he regained his strength, and now, by the doctor s advice, I have let him go to school.",
      "And certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect on him, and he is perfectly well, and making good progress.",
      "What a fine fellow he s grown!",
      "He s not Seryozha now, but quite full-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in blue coat and long trousers, who walked in alertly and confidently.",
      "The boy looked healthy and good-humored.",
      "He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but recognizing him, he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him, as though offended and irritated at something.",
      "The boy went up to his father and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school.",
      "Well, that s very fair, said his father, you can go.",
      "He s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a boy; I like that, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Do you remember me?",
      "The boy looked back quickly at his uncle.",
      "Yes, _mon oncle_, he answered, glancing at his father, and again he looked downcast.",
      "His uncle called him to him, and took his hand.",
      "Well, and how are you getting on?",
      "he said, wanting to talk to him, and not knowing what to say.",
      "The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his hand away.",
      "As soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his hand, he glanced doubtfully at his father, and like a bird set free, he darted out of the room.",
      "A year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his mother.",
      "Since then he had heard nothing more of her.",
      "And in the course of that year he had gone to school, and made friends among his schoolfellows.",
      "The dreams and memories of his mother, which had made him ill after seeing her, did not occupy his thoughts now.",
      "When they came back to him, he studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and girlish, below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy.",
      "He knew that his father and mother were separated by some quarrel, he knew that he had to remain with his father, and he tried to get used to that idea.",
      "He disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called up those memories of which he was ashamed.",
      "He disliked it all the more as from some words he had caught as he waited at the study door, and still more from the faces of his father and uncle, he guessed that they must have been talking of his mother.",
      "And to avoid condemning the father with whom he lived and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to avoid giving way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading, Seryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his peace of mind, and not to think of what he recalled to him.",
      "But when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him, saw him on the stairs, and calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime at school, Seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father s presence.",
      "We have a railway now, he said in answer to his uncle s question.",
      "It s like this, do you see: two sit on a bench they re the passengers; and one stands up straight on the bench.",
      "And all are harnessed to it by their arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms the doors are left open beforehand.",
      "Well, and it s pretty hard work being the conductor!",
      "That s the one that stands?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired, smiling.",
      "Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.",
      "Yes, that must be a serious matter, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, watching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother s; not childish now no longer fully innocent.",
      "And though he had promised Alexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he could not restrain himself.",
      "Do you remember your mother?",
      "he asked suddenly.",
      "No, I don t, Seryozha said quickly.",
      "He blushed crimson, and his face clouded over.",
      "And his uncle could get nothing more out of him.",
      "His tutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a long while he could not make out whether he was ill-tempered or crying.",
      "I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?",
      "said the tutor.",
      "I told you it was a dangerous game.",
      "And we shall have to speak to the director.",
      "If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that s certain.",
      "Well, what is it, then?",
      "Leave me alone!",
      "If I remember, or if I don t remember?...",
      "what business is it of his?",
      "Why should I remember?",
      "Leave me in peace!",
      "he said, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world.",
      "Chapter 20 Stepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg.",
      "In Petersburg, besides business, his sister s divorce, and his coveted appointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself up, as he said, after the mustiness of Moscow.",
      "In spite of its _caf s chantants_ and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a stagnant bog.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it.",
      "After living for some time in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he was conscious of a depression of spirits.",
      "After being a long time in Moscow without a change, he reached a point when he positively began to be worrying himself over his wife s ill-humor and reproaches, over his children s health and education, and the petty details of his official work; even the fact of being in debt worried him.",
      "But he had only to go and stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he moved, where people lived really lived instead of vegetating as in Moscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax before the fire.",
      "His wife?...",
      "Only that day he had been talking to Prince Tchetchensky.",
      "Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family, grown-up pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate family of children also.",
      "Though the first family was very nice too, Prince Tchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his eldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch that he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas.",
      "What would have been said to that in Moscow?",
      "His children?",
      "In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from enjoying life.",
      "The children were brought up in schools, and there was no trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov s household, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the children, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety.",
      "Here people understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as every man of culture should live.",
      "His official duties?",
      "Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless drudgery that it was in Moscow.",
      "Here there was some interest in official life.",
      "A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a knack of facetious mimicry, and a man s career might be made in a trice.",
      "So it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met the previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in government now.",
      "There was some interest in official work like that.",
      "The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Bartnyansky, who must spend at least fifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject.",
      "As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Bartnyansky: You re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor: say a word to him, please, for me.",
      "There s an appointment I should like to get secretary of the agency.... Oh, I shan t remember all that, if you tell it to me....",
      "But what possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?...",
      "Take it as you will, it s a low business.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a growing thing Bartnyansky would not have understood that.",
      "I want the money, I ve nothing to live on.",
      "You re living, aren t you?",
      "Yes, but in debt.",
      "Are you, though?",
      "Heavily?",
      "said Bartnyansky sympathetically.",
      "Very heavily: twenty thousand.",
      "Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.",
      "Oh, lucky fellow!",
      "My debts mount up to a million and a half, and I ve nothing, and still I can live, as you see!",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words only but in actual fact.",
      "Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and hadn t a farthing to bless himself with, and he lived, and in style too!",
      "Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone, and yet he kept two mistresses.",
      "Petrovsky had run through five millions, and still lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the financial department with a salary of twenty thousand.",
      "But besides this, Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "It made him younger.",
      "In Moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not dance at balls.",
      "In Petersburg he always felt ten years younger.",
      "His experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him on the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had just come back from abroad: We don t know the way to live here, said Pyotr Oblonsky.",
      "I spent the summer in Baden, and you wouldn t believe it, I felt quite a young man.",
      "At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts.... One dines and drinks a glass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything.",
      "I came home to Russia had to see my wife, and, what s more, go to my country place; and there, you d hardly believe it, in a fortnight I d got into a dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner.",
      "Needn t say I had no thoughts left for pretty women.",
      "I became quite an old gentleman.",
      "There was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation.",
      "I went off to Paris I was as right as could be at once.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky described.",
      "In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be there for long together, he might in good earnest have come to considering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the world again.",
      "Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long existed rather curious relations.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted with her in jest, and used to say to her, also in jest, the most unseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her so much.",
      "The day after his conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see her, and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense he recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate himself, as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he thought her positively disagreeable.",
      "What made it hard to change the conversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her.",
      "So that he was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which cut short their _t te- -t te_.",
      "Ah, so you re here!",
      "said she when she saw him.",
      "Well, and what news of your poor sister?",
      "You needn t look at me like that, she added.",
      "Ever since they ve all turned against her, all those who re a thousand times worse than she, I ve thought she did a very fine thing.",
      "I can t forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg.",
      "I d have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.",
      "Please give her my love.",
      "Come, tell me about her.",
      "Yes, her position is very difficult; she.... began Stepan Arkadyevitch, in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin Princess Myakaya s words tell me about her.",
      "Princess Myakaya interrupted him immediately, as she always did, and began talking herself.",
      "She s done what they all do, except me only they hide it.",
      "But she wouldn t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing.",
      "And she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours.",
      "You must excuse me.",
      "Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I was the only one that said he was a fool.",
      "Now that he s so thick with Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he s crazy, and I should prefer not to agree with everybody, but this time I can t help it.",
      "Oh, do please explain, said Stepan Arkadyevitch; what does it mean?",
      "Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister s behalf, and I asked him to give me a final answer.",
      "He gave me no answer, and said he would think it over.",
      "But this morning, instead of an answer, I received an invitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.",
      "Ah, so that s it, that s it!",
      "said Princess Myakaya gleefully, they re going to ask Landau what he s to say.",
      "Ask Landau?",
      "Who or what s Landau?",
      "you don t know Jules Landau, _le fameux Jules Landau, le clairvoyant_?",
      "He s crazy too, but on him your sister s fate depends.",
      "See what comes of living in the provinces you know nothing about anything.",
      "Landau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Paris, and he went to a doctor s; and in the doctor s waiting room he fell asleep, and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients.",
      "And wonderful advice it was!",
      "Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky you know, the invalid?",
      "heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband.",
      "And he cured her husband, though I can t say that I see he did him much good, for he s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in him, and took him along with them and brought him to Russia.",
      "Here there s been a general rush to him, and he s begun doctoring everyone.",
      "He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she adopted him.",
      "Adopted him?",
      "Yes, as her son.",
      "He s not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov.",
      "That s neither here nor there, though; but Lidia I m very fond of her, but she has a screw loose somewhere has lost her heart to this Landau now, and nothing is settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch s without him, and so your sister s fate is now in the hands of Landau, _alias_ Count Bezzubov.",
      "Chapter 21 After a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at Bartnyansky s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the appointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna s. Who else is with the countess?",
      "a Frenchman?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked the hall-porter, as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of Alexey Alexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking overcoat with clasps.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov, the porter answered severely.",
      "Princess Myakaya guessed right, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he went upstairs.",
      "Curious!",
      "It would be quite as well, though, to get on friendly terms with her.",
      "She has immense influence.",
      "If she would say a word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.",
      "It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia Ivanovna s little drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted.",
      "At a round table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch, talking softly.",
      "A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, with feminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long hair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at the end of the room gazing at the portraits on the wall.",
      "After greeting the lady of the house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not resist glancing once more at the unknown man.",
      "Monsieur Landau!",
      "the countess addressed him with a softness and caution that impressed Oblonsky.",
      "And she introduced them.",
      "Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his moist, lifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch s outstretched hand and immediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again.",
      "The countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.",
      "I am very glad to see you, particularly today, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside Karenin.",
      "I introduced you to him as Landau, she said in a soft voice, glancing at the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch, but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you re probably aware.",
      "Only he does not like the title.",
      "Yes, I heard so, answered Stepan Arkadyevitch; they say he completely cured Countess Bezzubova.",
      "She was here today, poor thing!",
      "the countess said, turning to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "This separation is awful for her.",
      "It s such a blow to her!",
      "And he positively is going?",
      "queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Yes, he s going to Paris.",
      "He heard a voice yesterday, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Ah, a voice!",
      "repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as circumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something peculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the key.",
      "A moment s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as though approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine smile to Oblonsky: I ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you.",
      "_Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis._ But to be a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one s friend, and I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "You understand what I mean?",
      "she said, lifting her fine pensive eyes.",
      "In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey Alexandrovitch.... said Oblonsky.",
      "Having no clear idea what they were talking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.",
      "The change is not in his external position, Countess Lidia Ivanovna said sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey Alexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau; his heart is changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you don t fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.",
      "Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change.",
      "We have always been friendly, and now.... said Stepan Arkadyevitch, responding with a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess, and mentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was most intimate, so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him.",
      "The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his heart.",
      "But I am afraid you do not understand me.",
      "Won t you have some tea?",
      "she said, with her eyes indicating the footman, who was handing round tea on a tray.",
      "Not quite, countess.",
      "Of course, his misfortune....",
      "Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when his heart was made new, was filled full of it, she said, gazing with eyes full of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them, thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Oh, of course, countess, he said; but I imagine such changes are a matter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, would care to speak of them.",
      "On the contrary!",
      "We ought to speak freely and help one another.",
      "Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions, and besides.... said Oblonsky with a soft smile.",
      "There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.",
      "Oh, no, of course; but.... and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in confusion.",
      "He understood at last that they were talking of religion.",
      "I fancy he will fall asleep immediately, said Alexey Alexandrovitch in a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round.",
      "Landau was sitting at the window, leaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping.",
      "Noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled a smile of childlike artlessness.",
      "Don t take any notice, said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly moved a chair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I have observed.... she was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and excusing herself, wrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it to the man, and came back to the table.",
      "I have observed, she went on, that Moscow people, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than anyone.",
      "Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of being the firmest in the faith, answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the indifferent ones, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him with a weary smile.",
      "How anyone can be indifferent!",
      "said Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in suspense, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating smile.",
      "I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.",
      "We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not, said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.",
      "We ought not to think whether we are ready or not ready.",
      "God s grace is not guided by human considerations: sometimes it comes not to those that strive for it, and comes to those that are unprepared, like Saul.",
      "No, I believe it won t be just yet, said Lidia Ivanovna, who had been meanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman.",
      "Landau got up and came to them.",
      "Do you allow me to listen?",
      "Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you, said Lidia Ivanovna, gazing tenderly at him; sit here with us.",
      "One has only not to close one s eyes to shut out the light, Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.",
      "Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever in our hearts!",
      "said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous smile.",
      "But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this religious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself to acknowledge his free-thinking views before a person who, by a single word to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment.",
      "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
      "But that is a false idea.",
      "There is no sin for believers, their sin has been atoned for.",
      "_Pardon,_ she added, looking at the footman, who came in again with another letter.",
      "She read it and gave a verbal answer: Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess s, say.",
      "For the believer sin is not, she went on.",
      "Yes, but faith without works is dead, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile clinging to his independence.",
      "There you have it from the epistle of St. James, said Alexey Alexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain reproachfulness in his tone.",
      "It was unmistakably a subject they had discussed more than once before.",
      "What harm has been done by the false interpretation of that passage!",
      "Nothing holds men back from belief like that misinterpretation.",
      "I have not works, so I cannot believe, though all the while that is not said.",
      "But the very opposite is said.",
      "Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, with disgusted contempt, those are the crude ideas of our monks....",
      "Yet that is nowhere said.",
      "It is far simpler and easier, she added, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at court she encouraged youthful maids of honor, disconcerted by the new surroundings of the court.",
      "We are saved by Christ who suffered for us.",
      "We are saved by faith, Alexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of approval at her words.",
      "_ Vous comprenez l anglais?",
      "_ asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through a shelf of books.",
      "I want to read him Safe and Happy, or Under the Wing, she said, looking inquiringly at Karenin.",
      "And finding the book, and sitting down again in her place, she opened it.",
      "It s very short.",
      "In it is described the way by which faith can be reached, and the happiness, above all earthly bliss, with which it fills the soul.",
      "The believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone.",
      "She was just settling herself to read when the footman came in again.",
      "Madame Borozdina?",
      "Tell her, tomorrow at two o clock.",
      "Yes, she said, putting her finger in the place in the book, and gazing before her with her fine pensive eyes, that is how true faith acts.",
      "You know Marie Sanina?",
      "You know about her trouble?",
      "She lost her only child.",
      "She was in despair.",
      "And what happened?",
      "She found this comforter, and she thanks God now for the death of her child.",
      "Such is the happiness faith brings!",
      "Oh, yes, that is most.... said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad they were going to read, and let him have a chance to collect his faculties.",
      "No, I see I d better not ask her about anything today, he thought.",
      "If only I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!",
      "It will be dull for you, said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, addressing Landau; you don t know English, but it s short.",
      "Oh, I shall understand, said Landau, with the same smile, and he closed his eyes.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged meaningful glances, and the reading began.",
      "Chapter 22 Stepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk which he was hearing for the first time.",
      "The complexity of Petersburg, as a rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of his Moscow stagnation.",
      "But he liked these complications, and understood them only in the circles he knew and was at home in.",
      "In these unfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not get his bearings.",
      "As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of the beautiful, artless or perhaps artful, he could not decide which eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevitch began to be conscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.",
      "The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head.",
      "Marie Sanina is glad her child s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!...",
      "To be saved, one need only believe, and the monks don t know how the thing s to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my head so heavy?",
      "Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer?",
      "Anyway, I fancy I ve done nothing unsuitable so far.",
      "But anyway, it won t do to ask her now.",
      "They say they make one say one s prayers.",
      "I only hope they won t make me!",
      "That ll be too imbecile.",
      "And what stuff it is she s reading!",
      "but she has a good accent.",
      "Landau Bezzubov what s he Bezzubov for?",
      "All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw was uncontrollably forming a yawn.",
      "He pulled his whiskers to cover the yawn, and shook himself together.",
      "But soon after he became aware that he was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring.",
      "He recovered himself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna was saying he s asleep.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay, feeling guilty and caught.",
      "But he was reassured at once by seeing that the words he s asleep referred not to him, but to Landau.",
      "The Frenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch s being asleep would have offended them, as he thought (though even this, he thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so queer), while Landau s being asleep delighted them extremely, especially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "_ Mon ami, _ said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds of her silk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement calling Karenin not Alexey Alexandrovitch, but _ mon ami, donnez-lui la main.",
      "Vous voyez?_ Sh!",
      "she hissed at the footman as he came in again.",
      "Not at home.",
      "The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his head on the back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on his knee, made faint movements, as though trying to catch something.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against the table, went up and laid his hand in the Frenchman s hand.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch got up too, and opening his eyes wide, trying to wake himself up if he were asleep, he looked first at one and then at the other.",
      "It was all real.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his head was getting worse and worse.",
      "_Que la personne qui est arriv e la derni re, celle qui demande, qu elle sorte!",
      "Qu elle sorte!_ articulated the Frenchman, without opening his eyes.",
      "_Vous m excuserez, mais vous voyez.... Revenez vers dix heures, encore mieux demain._ _Qu elle sorte!_ repeated the Frenchman impatiently.",
      "_C est moi, n est-ce pas?_ And receiving an answer in the affirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor he had meant to ask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister s affairs, caring for nothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as possible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from a plague-stricken house.",
      "For a long while he chatted and joked with his cab-driver, trying to recover his spirits.",
      "At the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and afterwards at the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a little refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to.",
      "But still he felt quite unlike himself all that evening.",
      "On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky s, where he was staying, Stepan Arkadyevitch found a note from Betsy.",
      "She wrote to him that she was very anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him to come next day.",
      "He had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its contents, when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants, carrying something heavy.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look.",
      "It was the rejuvenated Pyotr Oblonsky.",
      "He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told them to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and clinging to him, walked with him into his room and there began telling him how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with him, and for a long while he could not go to sleep.",
      "Everything he could recall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of all, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he had spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna s. Next day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer, refusing to grant Anna s divorce, and he understood that this decision was based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended trance.",
      "Chapter 23 In order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must necessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife, or loving agreement.",
      "When the relations of a couple are vacillating and neither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be undertaken.",
      "Many families remain for years in the same place, though both husband and wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete division nor agreement between them.",
      "Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and dust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and all the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and the leaves were covered with dust.",
      "But they did not go back to Vozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on staying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there had been no agreement between them.",
      "The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all efforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing it.",
      "It was an inner irritation, grounded in her mind on the conviction that his love had grown less; in his, on regret that he had put himself for her sake in a difficult position, which she, instead of lightening, made still more difficult.",
      "Neither of them gave full utterance to their sense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and tried on every pretext to prove this to one another.",
      "In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with all his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing love for women, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on her alone.",
      "That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must have transferred part of his love to other women or to another woman and she was jealous.",
      "She was jealous not of any particular woman but of the decrease of his love.",
      "Not having got an object for her jealousy, she was on the lookout for it.",
      "At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another.",
      "At one time she was jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his old bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might meet; then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to marry, for whose sake he would break with her.",
      "And this last form of jealousy tortured her most of all, especially as he had unwarily told her, in a moment of frankness, that his mother knew him so little that she had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young Princess Sorokina.",
      "And being jealous of him, Anna was indignant against him and found grounds for indignation in everything.",
      "For everything that was difficult in her position she blamed him.",
      "The agonizing condition of suspense she had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her solitude she put it all down to him.",
      "If he had loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position, and would have rescued her from it.",
      "For her being in Moscow and not in the country, he was to blame too.",
      "He could not live buried in the country as she would have liked to do.",
      "He must have society, and he had put her in this awful position, the bitterness of which he would not see.",
      "And again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son.",
      "Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not soothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency, of self-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her.",
      "It was dusk.",
      "Anna was alone, and waiting for him to come back from a bachelor dinner.",
      "She walked up and down in his study (the room where the noise from the street was least heard), and thought over every detail of their yesterday s quarrel.",
      "Going back from the well-remembered, offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the ground of it, she arrived at last at its origin.",
      "For a long while she could hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a conversation so inoffensive, of so little moment to either.",
      "But so it actually had been.",
      "It all arose from his laughing at the girls high schools, declaring they were useless, while she defended them.",
      "He had spoken slightingly of women s education in general, and had said that Hannah, Anna s English prot g e, had not the slightest need to know anything of physics.",
      "This irritated Anna.",
      "She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her occupations.",
      "And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the pain he had given her.",
      "I don t expect you to understand me, my feelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did expect, she said.",
      "And he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something unpleasant.",
      "She could not recall her answer, but at that point, with an unmistakable desire to wound her too, he had said: I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that s true, because I see it s unnatural.",
      "The cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for herself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life, the injustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of artificiality, aroused her.",
      "I am very sorry that nothing but what s coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you, she said and walked out of the room.",
      "When he had come in to her yesterday evening, they had not referred to the quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but was not at an end.",
      "Today he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and wretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it all, to forgive him, and be reconciled with him; she wanted to throw the blame on herself and to justify him.",
      "I m irritable, I m insanely jealous.",
      "I will make it up with him, and we ll go away to the country; there I shall be more at peace.",
      "Unnatural!",
      "She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of all, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which it was said.",
      "I know what he meant; he meant unnatural, not loving my own daughter, to love another person s child.",
      "What does he know of love for children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I ve sacrificed for him?",
      "But that wish to wound me!",
      "No, he loves another woman, it must be so.",
      "And perceiving that, while trying to regain her peace of mind, she had gone round the same circle that she had been round so often before, and had come back to her former state of exasperation, she was horrified at herself.",
      "Can it be impossible?",
      "Can it be beyond me to control myself?",
      "she said to herself, and began again from the beginning.",
      "He s truthful, he s honest, he loves me.",
      "I love him, and in a few days the divorce will come.",
      "What more do I want?",
      "I want peace of mind and trust, and I will take the blame on myself.",
      "Yes, now when he comes in, I will tell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away tomorrow.",
      "And to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability, she rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their things for the country.",
      "At ten o clock Vronsky came in.",
      "Chapter 24 Well, was it nice?",
      "she asked, coming out to meet him with a penitent and meek expression.",
      "Just as usual, he answered, seeing at a glance that she was in one of her good moods.",
      "He was used by now to these transitions, and he was particularly glad to see it today, as he was in a specially good humor himself.",
      "What do I see?",
      "Come, that s good!",
      "he said, pointing to the boxes in the passage.",
      "Yes, we must go.",
      "I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed to be in the country.",
      "There s nothing to keep you, is there?",
      "It s the one thing I desire.",
      "I ll be back directly, and we ll talk it over; I only want to change my coat.",
      "Order some tea.",
      "And he went into his room.",
      "There was something mortifying in the way he had said Come, that s good, as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty, and still more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his self-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the lust of strife rising up in her again, but making an effort she conquered it, and met Vronsky as good-humoredly as before.",
      "When he came in she told him, partly repeating phrases she had prepared beforehand, how she had spent the day, and her plans for going away.",
      "You know it came to me almost like an inspiration, she said.",
      "Why wait here for the divorce?",
      "Won t it be just the same in the country?",
      "I can t wait any longer!",
      "I don t want to go on hoping, I don t want to hear anything about the divorce.",
      "I have made up my mind it shall not have any more influence on my life.",
      "Do you agree?",
      "he said, glancing uneasily at her excited face.",
      "What did you do?",
      "Who was there?",
      "she said, after a pause.",
      "Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests.",
      "The dinner was first rate, and the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they can never do anything without something _ridicule_.",
      "A lady of a sort appeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and gave us an exhibition of her skill.",
      "did she swim?",
      "asked Anna, frowning.",
      "In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.",
      "So when shall we go?",
      "What an absurd fancy!",
      "Why, did she swim in some special way, then?",
      "said Anna, not answering.",
      "There was absolutely nothing in it.",
      "That s just what I say, it was awfully stupid.",
      "Well, then, when do you think of going?",
      "Anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant idea.",
      "Why, the sooner the better!",
      "By tomorrow we shan t be ready.",
      "The day after tomorrow.",
      "Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute!",
      "The day after tomorrow s Sunday, I have to be at maman s, said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he uttered his mother s name he was aware of her intent, suspicious eyes.",
      "His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion.",
      "She flushed hotly and drew away from him.",
      "It was now not the Queen of Sweden s swimming-mistress who filled Anna s imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina.",
      "She was staying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.",
      "Can t you go tomorrow?",
      "Well, no!",
      "The deeds and the money for the business I m going there for I can t get by tomorrow, he answered.",
      "If so, we won t go at all.",
      "I shall not go later.",
      "Monday or never!",
      "said Vronsky, as though in amazement.",
      "Why, there s no meaning in it!",
      "There s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me.",
      "You don t care to understand my life.",
      "The one thing that I cared for here was Hannah.",
      "You say it s affectation.",
      "Why, you said yesterday that I don t love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it s unnatural.",
      "I should like to know what life there is for me that could be natural!",
      "For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was horrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution.",
      "But even though she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself, could not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not give way to him.",
      "I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden passion.",
      "How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you don t tell the truth?",
      "I never boast, and I never tell lies, he said slowly, restraining his rising anger.",
      "It s a great pity if you can t respect....",
      "Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.",
      "And if you don t love me any more, it would be better and more honest to say so.",
      "No, this is becoming unbearable!",
      "cried Vronsky, getting up from his chair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking deliberately: What do you try my patience for?",
      "looking as though he might have said much more, but was restraining himself.",
      "It has limits.",
      "What do you mean by that?",
      "she cried, looking with terror at the undisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel, menacing eyes.",
      "I mean to say.... he was beginning, but he checked himself.",
      "I must ask what it is you want of me?",
      "What can I want?",
      "All I can want is that you should not desert me, as you think of doing, she said, understanding all he had not uttered.",
      "But that I don t want; that s secondary.",
      "I want love, and there is none.",
      "So then all is over.",
      "She turned towards the door.",
      "sto-op!",
      "said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his brows, though he held her by the hand.",
      "What is it all about?",
      "I said that we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I was lying, that I was not an honorable man.",
      "Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having sacrificed everything for me, she said, recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel, that he s worse than a dishonorable man he s a heartless man.",
      "Oh, there are limits to endurance!",
      "he cried, and hastily let go her hand.",
      "He hates me, that s clear, she thought, and in silence, without looking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room.",
      "He loves another woman, that s even clearer, she said to herself as she went into her own room.",
      "So, then, all is over.",
      "She repeated the words she had said, and it must be ended.",
      "she asked herself, and she sat down in a low chair before the looking-glass.",
      "Thoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought her up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what _he_ was doing now alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether reconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at Petersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would look at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this rupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them with all her heart.",
      "At the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea that alone interested her, but she could not get clear sight of it.",
      "Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled the time of her illness after her confinement, and the feeling which never left her at that time.",
      "Why didn t I die?",
      "and the words and the feeling of that time came back to her.",
      "And all at once she knew what was in her soul.",
      "Yes, it was that idea which alone solved all.",
      "Yes, to die!...",
      "And the shame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my awful shame, it will all be saved by death.",
      "To die!",
      "and he will feel remorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.",
      "With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in the armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand, vividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.",
      "Approaching footsteps his steps distracted her attention.",
      "As though absorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him.",
      "He went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly: Anna, we ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like.",
      "I agree to everything.",
      "She did not speak.",
      "he urged.",
      "You know, she said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain herself any longer, she burst into sobs.",
      "Cast me off!",
      "she articulated between her sobs.",
      "I ll go away tomorrow ...",
      "I ll do more.",
      "What am I?",
      "An immoral woman!",
      "A stone round your neck.",
      "I don t want to make you wretched, I don t want to!",
      "I ll set you free.",
      "You don t love me; you love someone else!",
      "Vronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace of foundation for her jealousy; that he had never ceased, and never would cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.",
      "Anna, why distress yourself and me so?",
      "he said to her, kissing her hands.",
      "There was tenderness now in his face, and she fancied she caught the sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her hand.",
      "And instantly Anna s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of tenderness.",
      "She put her arms round him, and covered with kisses his head, his neck, his hands.",
      "Chapter 25 Feeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work in the morning preparing for their departure.",
      "Though it was not settled whether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way to the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent whether they went a day earlier or later.",
      "She was standing in her room over an open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see her earlier than usual, dressed to go out.",
      "I m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by Yegorov.",
      "And I shall be ready to go tomorrow, he said.",
      "Though she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his mother s gave her a pang.",
      "No, I shan t be ready by then myself, she said; and at once reflected, so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.",
      "No, do as you meant to do.",
      "Go into the dining-room, I m coming directly.",
      "It s only to turn out those things that aren t wanted, she said, putting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka s arms.",
      "Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.",
      "You wouldn t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me, she said, sitting down beside him to her coffee.",
      "There s nothing more awful than these _chambres garnies_.",
      "There s no individuality in them, no soul.",
      "These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the wallpapers they re a nightmare.",
      "I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the promised land.",
      "You re not sending the horses off yet?",
      "No, they will come after us.",
      "Where are you going to?",
      "I wanted to go to Wilson s to take some dresses to her.",
      "So it s really to be tomorrow?",
      "she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face changed.",
      "Vronsky s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram from Petersburg.",
      "There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky s getting a telegram, but he said, as though anxious to conceal something from her, that the receipt was in his study, and he turned hurriedly to her.",
      "By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.",
      "From whom is the telegram?",
      "she asked, not hearing him.",
      "From Stiva, he answered reluctantly.",
      "Why didn t you show it to me?",
      "What secret can there be between Stiva and me?",
      "Vronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.",
      "I didn t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion for telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?",
      "About the divorce?",
      "Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet.",
      "He has promised a decisive answer in a day or two.",
      "But here it is; read it.",
      "With trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had told her.",
      "At the end was added: Little hope; but I will do everything possible and impossible.",
      "I said yesterday that it s absolutely nothing to me when I get, or whether I never get, a divorce, she said, flushing crimson.",
      "There was not the slightest necessity to hide it from me.",
      "So he may hide and does hide his correspondence with women from me, she thought.",
      "Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov, said Vronsky; I believe he s won from Pyevtsov all and more than he can pay, about sixty thousand.",
      "No, she said, irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of subject that he was irritated, why did you suppose that this news would affect me so, that you must even try to hide it?",
      "I said I don t want to consider it, and I should have liked you to care as little about it as I do.",
      "I care about it because I like definiteness, he said.",
      "Definiteness is not in the form but the love, she said, more and more irritated, not by his words, but by the tone of cool composure in which he spoke.",
      "What do you want it for?",
      "love again, he thought, frowning.",
      "Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children s in the future.",
      "There won t be children in the future.",
      "That s a great pity, he said.",
      "You want it for the children s sake, but you don t think of me?",
      "she said, quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said, _For your sake_ and the children s. The question of the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute and irritation to her.",
      "His desire to have children she interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.",
      "Oh, I said: for your sake.",
      "Above all for your sake, he repeated, frowning as though in pain, because I am certain that the greater part of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.",
      "Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred for me is apparent, she thought, not hearing his words, but watching with terror the cold, cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes.",
      "The cause is not that, she said, and, indeed, I don t see how the cause of my irritability, as you call it, can be that I am completely in your power.",
      "What indefiniteness is there in the position?",
      "on the contrary....",
      "I am very sorry that you don t care to understand, he interrupted, obstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought.",
      "The indefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free.",
      "On that score you can set your mind quite at rest, she said, and turning away from him, she began drinking her coffee.",
      "She lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to her lips.",
      "After drinking a few sips she glanced at him, and by his expression, she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand, and her gesture, and the sound made by her lips.",
      "I don t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she wants to make for you, she said, putting the cup down with a shaking hand.",
      "But we are not talking about that.",
      "Yes, that s just what we are talking about.",
      "And let me tell you that a heartless woman, whether she s old or not old, your mother or anyone else, is of no consequence to me, and I would not consent to know her.",
      "Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.",
      "A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son s happiness and honor lie has no heart.",
      "I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my mother, whom I respect, he said, raising his voice and looking sternly at her.",
      "She did not answer.",
      "Looking intently at him, at his face, his hands, she recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day, and his passionate caresses.",
      "There, just such caresses he has lavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!",
      "You don t love your mother.",
      "That s all talk, and talk, and talk!",
      "she said, looking at him with hatred in her eyes.",
      "Even if so, you must.... Must decide, and I have decided, she said, and she would have gone away, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room.",
      "Anna greeted him and remained.",
      "Why, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was standing at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful consequences why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances before an outsider, who sooner or later must know it all she did not know.",
      "But at once quelling the storm within her, she sat down and began talking to their guest.",
      "Well, how are you getting on?",
      "Has your debt been paid you?",
      "she asked Yashvin.",
      "Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan t get it all, but I shall get a good half.",
      "And when are you off?",
      "said Yashvin, looking at Vronsky, and unmistakably guessing at a quarrel.",
      "The day after tomorrow, I think, said Vronsky.",
      "You ve been meaning to go so long, though.",
      "But now it s quite decided, said Anna, looking Vronsky straight in the face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of reconciliation.",
      "Don t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?",
      "she went on, talking to Yashvin.",
      "I ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I m sorry for him or not.",
      "You see, all my fortune s here he touched his breast pocket and just now I m a wealthy man.",
      "But today I m going to the club, and I may come out a beggar.",
      "You see, whoever sits down to play with me he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do I him.",
      "And so we fight it out, and that s the pleasure of it.",
      "Well, but suppose you were married, said Anna, how would it be for your wife?",
      "Yashvin laughed.",
      "That s why I m not married, and never mean to be.",
      "And Helsingfors?",
      "said Vronsky, entering into the conversation and glancing at Anna s smiling face.",
      "Meeting his eyes, Anna s face instantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to him: It s not forgotten.",
      "It s all the same.",
      "Were you really in love?",
      "she said to Yashvin.",
      "Oh heavens!",
      "ever so many times!",
      "But you see, some men can play but only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a _rendezvous_ comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be late for my cards in the evening.",
      "That s how I manage things.",
      "No, I didn t mean that, but the real thing.",
      "She would have said _Helsingfors_, but would not repeat the word used by Vronsky.",
      "Voytov, who was buying the horse, came in.",
      "Anna got up and went out of the room.",
      "Before leaving the house, Vronsky went into her room.",
      "She would have pretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of making a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.",
      "she asked in French.",
      "To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I ve sold him, he said, in a tone which said more clearly than words, I ve no time for discussing things, and it would lead to nothing.",
      "I m not to blame in any way, he thought.",
      "If she will punish herself, _tant pis pour elle._ But as he was going he fancied that she said something, and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her.",
      "Eh, Anna?",
      "I said nothing, she answered just as coldly and calmly.",
      "Oh, nothing, _tant pis_ then, he thought, feeling cold again, and he turned and went out.",
      "As he was going out he caught a glimpse in the looking-glass of her face, white, with quivering lips.",
      "He even wanted to stop and to say some comforting word to her, but his legs carried him out of the room before he could think what to say.",
      "The whole of that day he spent away from home, and when he came in late in the evening the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and begged him not to go in to her.",
      "Chapter 26 Never before had a day been passed in quarrel.",
      "Today was the first time.",
      "And this was not a quarrel.",
      "It was the open acknowledgment of complete coldness.",
      "Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced when he came into the room for the guarantee?",
      "to look at her, see her heart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that face of callous composure?",
      "He was not merely cold to her, he hated her because he loved another woman that was clear.",
      "And remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, too, the words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to her, and she grew more and more exasperated.",
      "I won t prevent you, he might say.",
      "You can go where you like.",
      "You were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you might go back to him.",
      "Go back to him.",
      "If you want money, I ll give it to you.",
      "How many roubles do you want?",
      "All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said to her in her imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, as though he had actually said them.",
      "But didn t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful and sincere man?",
      "Haven t I despaired for nothing many times already?",
      "she said to herself afterwards.",
      "All that day, except for the visit to Wilson s, which occupied two hours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether there were still hope of reconciliation, whether she should go away at once or see him once more.",
      "She was expecting him the whole day, and in the evening, as she went to her own room, leaving a message for him that her head ached, she said to herself, If he comes in spite of what the maid says, it means that he loves me still.",
      "If not, it means that all is over, and then I will decide what I m to do!...",
      "In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the entrance, his ring, his steps and his conversation with the servant; he believed what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to his own room.",
      "So then everything was over.",
      "And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of bringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing him and of gaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession of her heart was waging with him.",
      "Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or not getting a divorce from her husband all that did not matter.",
      "The one thing that mattered was punishing him.",
      "When she poured herself out her usual dose of opium, and thought that she had only to drink off the whole bottle to die, it seemed to her so simple and easy, that she began musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer, and repent and love her memory when it would be too late.",
      "She lay in bed with open eyes, by the light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice of the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it, while she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would be no more, when she would be only a memory to him.",
      "How could I say such cruel things to her?",
      "he would say.",
      "How could I go out of the room without saying anything to her?",
      "But now she is no more.",
      "She has gone away from us forever.",
      "She is....",
      "Suddenly the shadow of the screen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other shadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the shadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted forward, wavered, commingled, and all was darkness.",
      "Death!",
      "And such horror came upon her that for a long while she could not realize where she was, and for a long while her trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one that had burned down and gone out.",
      "No, anything only to live!",
      "Why, I love him!",
      "Why, he loves me!",
      "This has been before and will pass, she said, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling down her cheeks.",
      "And to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his room.",
      "He was asleep there, and sleeping soundly.",
      "She went up to him, and holding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at him.",
      "Now when he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight of him she could not keep back tears of tenderness.",
      "But she knew that if he waked up he would look at her with cold eyes, convinced that he was right, and that before telling him of her love, she would have to prove to him that he had been wrong in his treatment of her.",
      "Without waking him, she went back, and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a heavy, incomplete sleep, during which she never quite lost consciousness.",
      "In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had recurred several times in her dreams, even before her connection with Vronsky.",
      "A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent down over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as she always did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it), felt that this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing something horrible with the iron over her.",
      "And she waked up in a cold sweat.",
      "When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in mist.",
      "There was a quarrel.",
      "Just what has happened several times.",
      "I said I had a headache, and he did not come in to see me.",
      "Tomorrow we re going away; I must see him and get ready for the journey, she said to herself.",
      "And learning that he was in his study, she went down to him.",
      "As she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at the entrance, and looking out of the window she saw the carriage, from which a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction to the footman ringing the bell.",
      "After a parley in the hall, someone came upstairs, and Vronsky s steps could be heard passing the drawing-room.",
      "He went rapidly downstairs.",
      "Anna went again to the window.",
      "She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up to the carriage.",
      "The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel.",
      "Vronsky, smiling, said something to her.",
      "The carriage drove away, he ran rapidly upstairs again.",
      "The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly.",
      "The feelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang.",
      "She could not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending a whole day with him in his house.",
      "She went into his room to announce her determination.",
      "That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter.",
      "They came and brought me the money and the deeds from maman.",
      "I couldn t get them yesterday.",
      "How is your head, better?",
      "he said quietly, not wishing to see and to understand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face.",
      "She looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle of the room.",
      "He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went on reading a letter.",
      "She turned, and went deliberately out of the room.",
      "He still might have turned her back, but she had reached the door, he was still silent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper as he turned it.",
      "Oh, by the way, he said at the very moment she was in the doorway, we re going tomorrow for certain, aren t we?",
      "You, but not I, she said, turning round to him.",
      "Anna, we can t go on like this.... You, but not I, she repeated.",
      "This is getting unbearable!",
      "You ... you will be sorry for this, she said, and went out.",
      "Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were uttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on second thoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth.",
      "This vulgar as he thought it threat of something vague exasperated him.",
      "I ve tried everything, he thought; the only thing left is not to pay attention, and he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother s to get her signature to the deeds.",
      "She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room.",
      "At the drawing-room he stood still.",
      "But he did not turn in to see her, he merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he came while he was away.",
      "Then she heard the carriage brought round, the door opened, and he came out again.",
      "But he went back into the porch again, and someone was running upstairs.",
      "It was the valet running up for his gloves that had been forgotten.",
      "She went to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the back he said something to him.",
      "Then without looking up at the window he settled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs crossed, and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner.",
      "Chapter 27 He has gone!",
      "It is over!",
      "Anna said to herself, standing at the window; and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness when the candle had flickered out, and of her fearful dream mingling into one, filled her heart with cold terror.",
      "No, that cannot be!",
      "she cried, and crossing the room she rang the bell.",
      "She was so afraid now of being alone, that without waiting for the servant to come in, she went out to meet him.",
      "Inquire where the count has gone, she said.",
      "The servant answered that the count had gone to the stable.",
      "His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage would be back immediately.",
      "I ll write a note at once.",
      "Send Mihail with the note to the stables.",
      "Make haste.",
      "She sat down and wrote: I was wrong.",
      "Come back home; I must explain.",
      "For God s sake come!",
      "I m afraid.",
      "She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.",
      "She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of the room, and went to the nursery.",
      "Why, this isn t it, this isn t he!",
      "Where are his blue eyes, his sweet, shy smile?",
      "was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy little girl with her black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery.",
      "The little girl sitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with a cork, and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes.",
      "Answering the English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was going to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and began spinning the cork to show her.",
      "But the child s loud, ringing laugh, and the motion of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that she got up hurriedly, restraining her sobs, and went away.",
      "Can it be all over?",
      "No, it cannot be!",
      "He will come back.",
      "But how can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to her?",
      "But even if he doesn t explain, I will believe.",
      "If I don t believe, there s only one thing left for me, and I can t. She looked at her watch.",
      "Twenty minutes had passed.",
      "By now he has received the note and is coming back.",
      "Not long, ten minutes more....",
      "But what if he doesn t come?",
      "No, that cannot be.",
      "He mustn t see me with tear-stained eyes.",
      "I ll go and wash.",
      "Yes, yes; did I do my hair or not?",
      "And she could not remember.",
      "She felt her head with her hand.",
      "Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can t in the least remember.",
      "She could not believe the evidence of her hand, and went up to the pier-glass to see whether she really had done her hair.",
      "She certainly had, but she could not think when she had done it.",
      "she thought, looking in the looking-glass at the swollen face with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at her.",
      "Why, it s I!",
      "she suddenly understood, and looking round, she seemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her shoulders, shuddering.",
      "Then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed it.",
      "Why, I m going out of my mind!",
      "and she went into her bedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.",
      "Annushka, she said, coming to a standstill before her, and she stared at the maid, not knowing what to say to her.",
      "You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna, said the girl, as though she understood.",
      "Yes, I ll go.",
      "Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back.",
      "He s coming, he ll be here soon.",
      "She took out her watch and looked at it.",
      "But how could he go away, leaving me in such a state?",
      "How can he live, without making it up with me?",
      "She went to the window and began looking into the street.",
      "Judging by the time, he might be back now.",
      "But her calculations might be wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to count the minutes.",
      "At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it with her watch, someone drove up.",
      "Glancing out of the window, she saw his carriage.",
      "But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard below.",
      "It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage.",
      "She went down to him.",
      "We didn t catch the count.",
      "The count had driven off on the lower city road.",
      "What!...",
      "she said to the rosy, good-humored Mihail, as he handed her back her note.",
      "Why, then, he has never received it!",
      "Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya s place, you know?",
      "and bring an answer back immediately, she said to the messenger.",
      "And I, what am I going to do?",
      "Yes, I m going to Dolly s, that s true or else I shall go out of my mind.",
      "Yes, and I can telegraph, too.",
      "And she wrote a telegram.",
      "I absolutely must talk to you; come at once.",
      "After sending off the telegram, she went to dress.",
      "When she was dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of the plump, comfortable-looking Annushka.",
      "There was unmistakable sympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes.",
      "Annushka, dear, what am I to do?",
      "said Anna, sobbing and sinking helplessly into a chair.",
      "Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "Why, there s nothing out of the way.",
      "You drive out a little, and it ll cheer you up, said the maid.",
      "Yes, I m going, said Anna, rousing herself and getting up.",
      "And if there s a telegram while I m away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna s ... but no, I shall be back myself.",
      "Yes, I mustn t think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most of all, get out of this house, she said, feeling with terror the strange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out and get into the carriage.",
      "Where to?",
      "asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.",
      "To Znamenka, the Oblonskys .",
      "Chapter 28 It was bright and sunny.",
      "A fine rain had been falling all the morning, and now it had not long cleared up.",
      "The iron roofs, the flags of the roads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass and the tinplate of the carriages all glistened brightly in the May sunshine.",
      "It was three o clock, and the very liveliest time in the streets.",
      "As she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed on its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of the unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure air, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she saw her position quite differently from how it had seemed at home.",
      "Now the thought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and death itself no longer seemed so inevitable.",
      "Now she blamed herself for the humiliation to which she had lowered herself.",
      "I entreat him to forgive me.",
      "I have given in to him.",
      "I have owned myself in fault.",
      "Can t I live without him?",
      "And leaving unanswered the question how she was going to live without him, she fell to reading the signs on the shops.",
      "Office and warehouse.",
      "Dental surgeon.",
      "Yes, I ll tell Dolly all about it.",
      "She doesn t like Vronsky.",
      "I shall be sick and ashamed, but I ll tell her.",
      "She loves me, and I ll follow her advice.",
      "I won t give in to him; I won t let him train me as he pleases.",
      "Filippov, bun shop.",
      "They say they send their dough to Petersburg.",
      "The Moscow water is so good for it.",
      "Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!",
      "And she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of seventeen, she had gone with her aunt to Troitsa.",
      "Riding, too.",
      "Was that really me, with red hands?",
      "How much that seemed to me then splendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then has gone out of my reach forever!",
      "Could I ever have believed then that I could come to such humiliation?",
      "How conceited and self-satisfied he will be when he gets my note!",
      "But I will show him.... How horrid that paint smells!",
      "Why is it they re always painting and building?",
      "_Modes et robes_, she read.",
      "A man bowed to her.",
      "It was Annushka s husband.",
      "Our parasites ; she remembered how Vronsky had said that.",
      "Our?",
      "Why our?",
      "What s so awful is that one can t tear up the past by its roots.",
      "One can t tear it out, but one can hide one s memory of it.",
      "And I ll hide it.",
      "And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch, of how she had blotted the memory of it out of her life.",
      "Dolly will think I m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.",
      "As if I cared to be right!",
      "I can t help it!",
      "she said, and she wanted to cry.",
      "But at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be smiling about.",
      "Love, most likely.",
      "They don t know how dreary it is, how low....",
      "The boulevard and the children.",
      "Three boys running, playing at horses.",
      "And I m losing everything and not getting him back.",
      "Yes, I m losing everything, if he doesn t return.",
      "Perhaps he was late for the train and has come back by now.",
      "Longing for humiliation again!",
      "No, I ll go to Dolly, and say straight out to her, I m unhappy, I deserve this, I m to blame, but still I m unhappy, help me.",
      "These horses, this carriage how loathsome I am to myself in this carriage all his; but I won t see them again.",
      "Thinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly, and mentally working her heart up to great bitterness, Anna went upstairs.",
      "Is there anyone with her?",
      "she asked in the hall.",
      "Katerina Alexandrovna Levin, answered the footman.",
      "Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!",
      "thought Anna, the girl he thinks of with love.",
      "He s sorry he didn t marry her.",
      "But me he thinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me.",
      "The sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.",
      "Dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their conversation.",
      "Well, so you ve not gone away yet?",
      "I meant to have come to you, she said; I had a letter from Stiva today.",
      "We had a telegram too, answered Anna, looking round for Kitty.",
      "He writes that he can t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch wants, but he won t go away without a decisive answer.",
      "I thought you had someone with you.",
      "Can I see the letter?",
      "Yes; Kitty, said Dolly, embarrassed.",
      "She stayed in the nursery.",
      "She has been very ill.",
      "So I heard.",
      "May I see the letter?",
      "I ll get it directly.",
      "But he doesn t refuse; on the contrary, Stiva has hopes, said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.",
      "I haven t, and indeed I don t wish it, said Anna.",
      "Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?",
      "thought Anna when she was alone.",
      "Perhaps she s right, too.",
      "But it s not for her, the girl who was in love with Vronsky, it s not for her to show me that, even if it is true.",
      "I know that in my position I can t be received by any decent woman.",
      "I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed everything to him.",
      "And this is my reward!",
      "Oh, how I hate him!",
      "And what did I come here for?",
      "I m worse here, more miserable.",
      "She heard from the next room the sisters voices in consultation.",
      "And what am I going to say to Dolly now?",
      "Amuse Kitty by the sight of my wretchedness, submit to her patronizing?",
      "No; and besides, Dolly wouldn t understand.",
      "And it would be no good my telling her.",
      "It would only be interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone and everything, how nothing matters to me now.",
      "Dolly came in with the letter.",
      "Anna read it and handed it back in silence.",
      "I knew all that, she said, and it doesn t interest me in the least.",
      "On the contrary, I have hopes, said Dolly, looking inquisitively at Anna.",
      "She had never seen her in such a strangely irritable condition.",
      "When are you going away?",
      "Anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not answer.",
      "Why does Kitty shrink from me?",
      "she said, looking at the door and flushing red.",
      "She s nursing, and things aren t going right with her, and I ve been advising her.... She s delighted.",
      "She ll be here in a minute, said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying.",
      "Yes, here she is.",
      "Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly persuaded her.",
      "Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her, blushing, and shook hands.",
      "I am so glad to see you, she said with a trembling voice.",
      "Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her antagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her.",
      "But as soon as she saw Anna s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of antagonism disappeared.",
      "I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me.",
      "I m used to everything.",
      "You have been ill?",
      "Yes, you are changed, said Anna.",
      "Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes.",
      "She ascribed this hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.",
      "They talked of Kitty s illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was obvious that nothing interested Anna.",
      "I came to say good-bye to you, she said, getting up.",
      "Oh, when are you going?",
      "But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.",
      "Yes, I am very glad to have seen you, she said with a smile.",
      "I have heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband.",
      "He came to see me, and I liked him exceedingly, she said, unmistakably with malicious intent.",
      "He has gone back to the country, said Kitty, blushing.",
      "Remember me to him, be sure you do.",
      "I ll be sure to!",
      "Kitty said na vely, looking compassionately into her eyes.",
      "So good-bye, Dolly.",
      "And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty, Anna went out hurriedly.",
      "She s just the same and just as charming!",
      "She s very lovely!",
      "said Kitty, when she was alone with her sister.",
      "But there s something piteous about her.",
      "Awfully piteous!",
      "Yes, there s something unusual about her today, said Dolly.",
      "When I went with her into the hall, I fancied she was almost crying.",
      "Chapter 29 Anna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than when she set out from home.",
      "To her previous tortures was added now that sense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so distinctly on meeting Kitty.",
      "Home?",
      "asked Pyotr.",
      "Yes, home, she said, not even thinking now where she was going.",
      "How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and curious!",
      "What can he be telling the other with such warmth?",
      "she thought, staring at two men who walked by.",
      "Can one ever tell anyone what one is feeling?",
      "I meant to tell Dolly, and it s a good thing I didn t tell her.",
      "How pleased she would have been at my misery!",
      "She would have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for.",
      "Kitty, she would have been even more pleased.",
      "How I can see through her!",
      "She knows I was more than usually sweet to her husband.",
      "And she s jealous and hates me.",
      "And she despises me.",
      "In her eyes I m an immoral woman.",
      "If I were an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with me ... if I d cared to.",
      "And, indeed, I did care to.",
      "There s someone who s pleased with himself, she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund gentleman coming towards her.",
      "He took her for an acquaintance, and lifted his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived his mistake.",
      "He thought he knew me.",
      "Well, he knows me as well as anyone in the world knows me.",
      "I don t know myself.",
      "I know my appetites, as the French say.",
      "They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know for certain, she thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream seller, who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring face with a towel.",
      "We all want what is sweet and nice.",
      "If not sweetmeats, then a dirty ice.",
      "And Kitty s the same if not Vronsky, then Levin.",
      "And she envies me, and hates me.",
      "And we all hate each other.",
      "I Kitty, Kitty me.",
      "Yes, that s the truth.",
      "_Tiutkin, coiffeur._ _Je me fais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I ll tell him that when he comes, she thought and smiled.",
      "But the same instant she remembered that she had no one now to tell anything amusing to.",
      "And there s nothing amusing, nothing mirthful, really.",
      "It s all hateful.",
      "They re singing for vespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses himself!",
      "as if he were afraid of missing something.",
      "Why these churches and this singing and this humbug?",
      "Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily.",
      "Yashvin says, He wants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.",
      "Yes, that s the truth!",
      "She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left off thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the steps of her house.",
      "It was only when she saw the porter running out to meet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.",
      "Is there an answer?",
      "I ll see this minute, answered the porter, and glancing into his room, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram.",
      "I can t come before ten o clock.",
      "Vronsky, she read.",
      "And hasn t the messenger come back?",
      "No, answered the porter.",
      "Then, since it s so, I know what I must do, she said, and feeling a vague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her, she ran upstairs.",
      "I ll go to him myself.",
      "Before going away forever, I ll tell him all.",
      "Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!",
      "Seeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered with aversion.",
      "She did not consider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he had not yet received her note.",
      "She pictured him to herself as talking calmly to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her sufferings.",
      "Yes, I must go quickly, she said, not knowing yet where she was going.",
      "She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the feelings she had gone through in that awful house.",
      "The servants, the walls, the things in that house all aroused repulsion and hatred in her and lay like a weight upon her.",
      "Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he s not there, then go there and catch him.",
      "Anna looked at the railway timetable in the newspapers.",
      "An evening train went at two minutes past eight.",
      "Yes, I shall be in time.",
      "She gave orders for the other horses to be put in the carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few days.",
      "She knew she would never come back here again.",
      "Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that after what would happen at the station or at the countess s house, she would go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.",
      "Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and cheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting.",
      "She ordered the carriage and went out.",
      "The house threw a shadow now right across the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the sunshine.",
      "Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put the things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor, were all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.",
      "I don t want you, Pyotr.",
      "But how about the ticket?",
      "Well, as you like, it doesn t matter, she said crossly.",
      "Pyotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the coachman to drive to the booking-office.",
      "Chapter 30 Here it is again!",
      "Again I understand it all!",
      "Anna said to herself, as soon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the tiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed rapidly upon another.",
      "Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?",
      "she tried to recall it.",
      "_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_ no, not that.",
      "Yes, of what Yashvin says, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds men together.",
      "No, it s a useless journey you re making, she said, mentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an excursion into the country.",
      "And the dog you re taking with you will be no help to you.",
      "You can t get away from yourselves.",
      "Turning her eyes in the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she saw a factory-hand almost dead-drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman.",
      "Come, he s found a quicker way, she thought.",
      "Count Vronsky and I did not find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.",
      "And now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she was seeing everything on to her relations with him, which she had hitherto avoided thinking about.",
      "What was it he sought in me?",
      "Not love so much as the satisfaction of vanity.",
      "She remembered his words, the expression of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the early days of their connection.",
      "And everything now confirmed this.",
      "Yes, there was the triumph of success in him.",
      "Of course there was love too, but the chief element was the pride of success.",
      "He boasted of me.",
      "Now that s over.",
      "There s nothing to be proud of.",
      "Not to be proud of, but to be ashamed of.",
      "He has taken from me all he could, and now I am no use to him.",
      "He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable in his behavior to me.",
      "He let that out yesterday he wants divorce and marriage so as to burn his ships.",
      "He loves me, but how?",
      "The zest is gone, as the English say.",
      "That fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with himself, she thought, looking at a red-faced clerk, riding on a riding-school horse.",
      "Yes, there s not the same flavor about me for him now.",
      "If I go away from him, at the bottom of his heart he will be glad.",
      "This was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing light, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human relations.",
      "My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is waning and waning, and that s why we re drifting apart.",
      "She went on musing.",
      "And there s no help for it.",
      "He is everything for me, and I want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely.",
      "And he wants more and more to get away from me.",
      "We walked to meet each other up to the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in different directions.",
      "And there s no altering that.",
      "He tells me I m insanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous; but it s not true.",
      "I m not jealous, but I m unsatisfied.",
      "But.... she opened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the excitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her.",
      "If I could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but his caresses; but I can t and I don t care to be anything else.",
      "And by that desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it cannot be different.",
      "Don t I know that he wouldn t deceive me, that he has no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he s not in love with Kitty, that he won t desert me!",
      "I know all that, but it makes it no better for me.",
      "If without loving me, from _duty_ he ll be good and kind to me, without what I want, that s a thousand times worse than unkindness!",
      "That s hell!",
      "And that s just how it is.",
      "For a long while now he hasn t loved me.",
      "And where love ends, hate begins.",
      "I don t know these streets at all.",
      "Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses.... And in the houses always people and people.... How many of them, no end, and all hating each other!",
      "Come, let me try and think what I want, to make me happy.",
      "Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey Alexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.",
      "Thinking of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her, with his mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling which had existed between them, and which was also called love, she shuddered with loathing.",
      "Well, I m divorced, and become Vronsky s wife.",
      "Well, will Kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today?",
      "And will Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands?",
      "And is there any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and me?",
      "Is there possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery?",
      "she answered now without the slightest hesitation.",
      "We are drawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and there s no altering him or me.",
      "Every attempt has been made, the screw has come unscrewed.",
      "Oh, a beggar woman with a baby.",
      "She thinks I m sorry for her.",
      "Aren t we all flung into the world only to hate each other, and so to torture ourselves and each other?",
      "Schoolboys coming laughing Seryozha?",
      "I thought, too, that I loved him, and used to be touched by my own tenderness.",
      "But I have lived without him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the exchange till that love was satisfied.",
      "And with loathing she thought of what she meant by that love.",
      "And the clearness with which she saw life now, her own and all men s, was a pleasure to her.",
      "It s so with me and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the people living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go, and everywhere and always, she thought when she had driven under the low-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod station, and the porters ran to meet her.",
      "A ticket to Obiralovka?",
      "said Pyotr.",
      "She had utterly forgotten where and why she was going, and only by a great effort she understood the question.",
      "Yes, she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in her hand, she got out of the carriage.",
      "Making her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she gradually recollected all the details of her position, and the plans between which she was hesitating.",
      "And again at the old sore places, hope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully throbbing heart.",
      "As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the train, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they were all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the station, would write him a note, and what she would write to him, and how he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position, not understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room, and what she would say to him.",
      "Then she thought that life might still be happy, and how miserably she loved and hated him, and how fearfully her heart was beating.",
      "Chapter 31 A bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time careful of the impression they were making, hurried by.",
      "Pyotr, too, crossed the room in his livery and top-boots, with his dull, animal face, and came up to her to take her to the train.",
      "Some noisy men were quiet as she passed them on the platform, and one whispered something about her to another something vile, no doubt.",
      "She stepped up on the high step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that had been white.",
      "Her bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the springiness of the seat.",
      "With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his hat, with its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch.",
      "A grotesque-looking lady wearing a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled at her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the platform.",
      "Katerina Andreevna, she s got them all, _ma tante!_ cried the girl.",
      "Even the child s hideous and affected, thought Anna.",
      "To avoid seeing anyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of the empty carriage.",
      "A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a cap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that window, stooping down to the carriage wheels.",
      "There s something familiar about that hideous peasant, thought Anna.",
      "And remembering her dream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror.",
      "The conductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife.",
      "Anna made no answer.",
      "The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did not notice under her veil her panic-stricken face.",
      "She went back to her corner and sat down.",
      "The couple seated themselves on the opposite side, and intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes.",
      "Both husband and wife seemed repulsive to Anna.",
      "The husband asked, would she allow him to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into conversation with her.",
      "Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in French something about caring less to smoke than to talk.",
      "They made inane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.",
      "Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each other.",
      "And no one could have helped hating such miserable monstrosities.",
      "A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise, shouting and laughter.",
      "It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing for anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly, and she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it.",
      "At last the third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a clank of chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself.",
      "It would be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that, thought Anna, looking angrily at him.",
      "She looked past the lady out of the window at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the train or stood on the platform.",
      "The train, jerking at regular intervals at the junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone wall, a signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly and evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails.",
      "The window was lighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the curtain.",
      "Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of the train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.",
      "Yes, what did I stop at?",
      "That I couldn t conceive a position in which life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable, and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.",
      "And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?",
      "That s what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him, said the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with her phrase.",
      "The words seemed an answer to Anna s thoughts.",
      "To escape from what worries him, repeated Anna.",
      "And glancing at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself.",
      "Anna seemed to see all their history and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light upon them.",
      "But there was nothing interesting in them, and she pursued her thought.",
      "Yes, I m very much worried, and that s what reason was given me for, to escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when there s nothing more to look at, when it s sickening to look at it all?",
      "Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they shrieking, those young men in that train?",
      "why are they talking, why are they laughing?",
      "It s all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all cruelty!...",
      "When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of passengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she stood on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and what she meant to do.",
      "Everything that had seemed to her possible before was now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of hideous people who would not leave her alone.",
      "One moment porters ran up to her proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels on the planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people meeting her dodged past on the wrong side.",
      "Remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.",
      "Count Vronsky?",
      "They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter.",
      "And what is the coachman like?",
      "Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a letter.",
      "She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.",
      "I am very sorry your note did not reach me.",
      "I will be home at ten, Vronsky had written carelessly....",
      "Yes, that s what I expected!",
      "she said to herself with an evil smile.",
      "Very good, you can go home then, she said softly, addressing Mihail.",
      "She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart s beating hindered her breathing.",
      "No, I won t let you make me miserable, she thought menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made her suffer, and she walked along the platform.",
      "Two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads, staring at her and making some remarks about her dress.",
      "Real, they said of the lace she was wearing.",
      "The young men would not leave her in peace.",
      "Again they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh shouting something in an unnatural voice.",
      "The station-master coming up asked her whether she was going by train.",
      "A boy selling kvas never took his eyes off her.",
      "she thought, going farther and farther along the platform.",
      "At the end she stopped.",
      "Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she reached them.",
      "She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the edge of the platform.",
      "A luggage train was coming in.",
      "The platform began to sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.",
      "And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she had first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do.",
      "With a rapid, light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train.",
      "She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.",
      "There, she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers there, in the very middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself.",
      "She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it reached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment.",
      "She had to wait for the next carriage.",
      "A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself.",
      "That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys.",
      "But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage.",
      "And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees.",
      "And at the same instant she was terror-stricken at what she was doing.",
      "Where am I?",
      "What am I doing?",
      "She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back.",
      "Lord, forgive me all!",
      "she said, feeling it impossible to struggle.",
      "A peasant muttering something was working at the iron above her.",
      "And the light by which she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow, and evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her all that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was quenched forever.",
      "PART EIGHT Chapter 1 Almost two months had passed.",
      "The hot summer was half over, but Sergey Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch s life had not been uneventful during this time.",
      "A year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years labor, Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe and Russia.",
      "Several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public.",
      "But still Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world.",
      "After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.",
      "Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends inquiries as to how the book was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained attention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature.",
      "But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression whatever could be detected.",
      "His friends who were specialists and savants, occasionally unmistakably from politeness alluded to it.",
      "The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all.",
      "And society generally just now especially absorbed in other things was absolutely indifferent.",
      "In the press, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was silence.",
      "Only in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to Koznishev s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.",
      "At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article.",
      "He had met him once at Golubtsov s. The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations.",
      "In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article.",
      "The article was awful.",
      "The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it.",
      "But he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even as suggested by marks of interrogation used appropriately, and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject.",
      "And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself.",
      "But that was just what was so awful.",
      "In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic s arguments, he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article.",
      "Didn t I offend him in some way?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.",
      "And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article.",
      "This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six years task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no trace.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch s position was still more difficult from the fact that, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he did not know what use to make of his energy.",
      "Conversations in drawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees everywhere where talk was possible took up part of his time.",
      "But being used for years to town life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less experienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow.",
      "He had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.",
      "Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions, and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.",
      "In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of or written about just now but the Servian War.",
      "Everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the Slavonic States.",
      "Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies dresses, beer, restaurants everything testified to sympathy with the Slavonic peoples.",
      "From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey Ivanovitch differed on various points.",
      "He saw that the Slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation.",
      "He saw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and self-advertisement.",
      "He recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.",
      "He saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury generals without armies, ministers not in the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers.",
      "He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd.",
      "But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize.",
      "The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors.",
      "And the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed.",
      "But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "That was the manifestation of public opinion.",
      "The public had definitely expressed its desire.",
      "The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch said, found expression.",
      "And the more he worked in this cause, the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions, to create an epoch.",
      "He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause, and forgot to think about his book.",
      "His whole time now was engrossed by it, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him.",
      "He worked the whole spring and part of the summer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his brother s in the country.",
      "He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded.",
      "Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with Levin, and so he was going with him.",
      "Chapter 2 Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that day, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their things, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs.",
      "Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station.",
      "One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "You too come to see them off?",
      "No, I m going away myself, princess.",
      "To my brother s for a holiday.",
      "Do you always see them off?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile.",
      "Oh, that would be impossible!",
      "answered the princess.",
      "Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?",
      "Malvinsky wouldn t believe me.",
      "More than eight hundred.",
      "If you reckon those who have been sent not directly from Moscow, over a thousand, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "That s just what I said!",
      "exclaimed the lady.",
      "And it s true too, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?",
      "Yes, princess.",
      "What do you say to today s telegram?",
      "Beaten the Turks again.",
      "Yes, so I saw, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "They were speaking of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.",
      "Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and they ve made some difficulty, I don t know why.",
      "I meant to ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case.",
      "He s being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed it to the princess.",
      "You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?",
      "said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he found her again and gave her the letter.",
      "I had heard he was going, but I did not know when.",
      "By this train?",
      "I ve seen him.",
      "He s here: there s only his mother seeing him off.",
      "It s the best thing, anyway, that he could do.",
      "Oh, yes, of course.",
      "While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining-room.",
      "They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.",
      "In the service of religion, humanity, and our brothers, the gentleman said, his voice growing louder and louder; to this great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her blessing.",
      "_Jivio!_ he concluded, loudly and tearfully.",
      "Everyone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall, almost carrying the princess off her legs.",
      "Ah, princess!",
      "that was something like!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile.",
      "Capitally, warmly said, wasn t it?",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch!",
      "Why, you ought to have said something just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well, he added with a soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the arm.",
      "No, I m just off.",
      "To the country, to my brother s, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Then you ll see my wife.",
      "I ve written to her, but you ll see her first.",
      "Please tell her that they ve seen me and that it s all right, as the English say.",
      "She ll understand.",
      "Oh, and be so good as to tell her I m appointed secretary of the committee....",
      "But she ll understand!",
      "You know, _les petites mis res de la vie humaine,_ he said, as it were apologizing to the princess.",
      "And Princess Myakaya not Liza, but Bibish is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses.",
      "Did I tell you?",
      "Yes, I heard so, answered Koznishev indifferently.",
      "It s a pity you re going away, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Tomorrow we re giving a dinner to two who re setting off Dimer-Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha.",
      "They re both going.",
      "Veslovsky s only lately married.",
      "There s a fine fellow for you!",
      "Eh, princess?",
      "he turned to the lady.",
      "The princess looked at Koznishev without replying.",
      "But the fact that Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Smiling, he stared at the feather in the princess s hat, and then about him as though he were going to pick something up.",
      "Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting box, he beckoned her up and put in a five-rouble note.",
      "I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I ve money in my pocket, he said.",
      "And how about today s telegram?",
      "Fine chaps those Montenegrins!",
      "he cried, when the princess told him that Vronsky was going by this train.",
      "For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch s face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky was, he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister s corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.",
      "With all his faults one can t refuse to do him justice, said the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left them.",
      "What a typically Russian, Slav nature!",
      "Only, I m afraid it won t be pleasant for Vronsky to see him.",
      "Say what you will, I m touched by that man s fate.",
      "Do talk to him a little on the way, said the princess.",
      "Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.",
      "I never liked him.",
      "But this atones for a great deal.",
      "He s not merely going himself, he s taking a squadron at his own expense.",
      "Yes, so I heard.",
      "A bell sounded.",
      "Everyone crowded to the doors.",
      "said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat.",
      "Oblonsky was walking beside him, talking eagerly of something.",
      "Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did not hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",
      "Probably on Oblonsky s pointing them out, he looked round in the direction where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and without speaking lifted his hat.",
      "His face, aged and worn by suffering, looked stony.",
      "Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a compartment.",
      "On the platform there rang out God save the Tsar, then shouts of hurrah!",
      "and _ jivio!",
      "_ One of the volunteers, a tall, very young man with a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving his felt hat and a nosegay over his head.",
      "Then two officers emerged, bowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage cap.",
      "Chapter 3 Saying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by Katavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and the train started.",
      "At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men singing Hail to Thee!",
      "Again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them.",
      "He had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him.",
      "Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much interested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to them himself.",
      "At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.",
      "At the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the acquaintance of the volunteers.",
      "They were sitting in a corner of the carriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the passengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them.",
      "More loudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man.",
      "He was unmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at his school.",
      "Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian military jacket of the Guards uniform.",
      "He was listening with a smile to the hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up.",
      "The third, in an artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them.",
      "A fourth was asleep.",
      "Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he was a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune before he was two-and-twenty.",
      "Katavasov did not like him, because he was unmanly and effeminate and sickly.",
      "He was obviously convinced, especially now after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action, and he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.",
      "The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon Katavasov.",
      "He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything.",
      "He had been on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories, and he talked, quite without necessity, of all he had done, and used learned expressions quite inappropriately.",
      "The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very favorably.",
      "He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the knowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant and saying nothing about himself.",
      "When Katavasov asked him what had impelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly: Oh, well, everyone s going.",
      "The Servians want help, too.",
      "I m sorry for them.",
      "Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there, said Katavasov.",
      "Oh, I wasn t long in the artillery, maybe they ll put me into the infantry or the cavalry.",
      "Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?",
      "said Katavasov, fancying from the artilleryman s apparent age that he must have reached a fairly high grade.",
      "I wasn t long in the artillery; I m a cadet retired, he said, and he began to explain how he had failed in his examination.",
      "All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and when the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would have liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with someone.",
      "There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military overcoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov s conversation with the volunteers.",
      "When they were left alone, Katavasov addressed him.",
      "What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are going off there, Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to express his own opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the old man s views.",
      "The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns.",
      "He knew what makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of those persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the bottle on the journey, he considered them poor soldiers.",
      "Moreover, he lived in a district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier had volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would employ as a laborer.",
      "But knowing by experience that in the present condition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion opposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers unfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.",
      "Well, men are wanted there, he said, laughing with his eyes.",
      "And they fell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed from the other his perplexity as to the engagement expected next day, since the Turks had been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points.",
      "And so they parted, neither giving expression to his opinion.",
      "Katavasov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy reported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers, from which it would appear that they were capital fellows.",
      "At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with shouts and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared, and provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed them into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and feebler scale than in Moscow.",
      "Chapter 4 While the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch did not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the platform.",
      "The first time he passed Vronsky s compartment he noticed that the curtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time he saw the old countess at the window.",
      "She beckoned to Koznishev.",
      "I m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk, she said.",
      "Yes, so I heard, said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her window and peeping in.",
      "What a noble act on his part!",
      "he added, noticing that Vronsky was not in the compartment.",
      "Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?",
      "What a terrible thing it was!",
      "Ah, what I have been through!",
      "But do get in.... Ah, what I have been through!",
      "she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and sat down beside her.",
      "You can t conceive it!",
      "For six weeks he did not speak to anyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him.",
      "And not for one minute could we leave him alone.",
      "We took away everything he could have used against himself.",
      "We lived on the ground floor, but there was no reckoning on anything.",
      "You know, of course, that he had shot himself once already on her account, she said, and the old lady s eyelashes twitched at the recollection.",
      "Yes, hers was the fitting end for such a woman.",
      "Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.",
      "It s not for us to judge, countess, said Sergey Ivanovitch; but I can understand that it has been very hard for you.",
      "Ah, don t speak of it!",
      "I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.",
      "A note was brought him.",
      "He wrote an answer and sent it off.",
      "We hadn t an idea that she was close by at the station.",
      "In the evening I had only just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself under the train.",
      "Something seemed to strike me at once.",
      "I knew it was she.",
      "The first thing I said was, he was not to be told.",
      "But they d told him already.",
      "His coachman was there and saw it all.",
      "When I ran into his room, he was beside himself it was fearful to see him.",
      "He didn t say a word, but galloped off there.",
      "I don t know to this day what happened there, but he was brought back at death s door.",
      "I shouldn t have known him.",
      "_Prostration compl te,_ the doctor said.",
      "And that was followed almost by madness.",
      "Oh, why talk of it!",
      "said the countess with a wave of her hand.",
      "It was an awful time!",
      "No, say what you will, she was a bad woman.",
      "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
      "It was all to show herself something out of the way.",
      "Well, and that she did do.",
      "She brought herself to ruin and two good men her husband and my unhappy son.",
      "And what did her husband do?",
      "asked Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "He has taken her daughter.",
      "Alexey was ready to agree to anything at first.",
      "Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own child away to another man.",
      "But he can t take back his word.",
      "Karenin came to the funeral.",
      "But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey.",
      "For him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway.",
      "She had set him free.",
      "But my poor son was utterly given up to her.",
      "He had thrown up everything, his career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set purpose she made his ruin complete.",
      "No, say what you will, her very death was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling.",
      "God forgive me, but I can t help hating the memory of her, when I look at my son s misery!",
      "But how is he now?",
      "It was a blessing from Providence for us this Servian war.",
      "I m old, and I don t understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it s come as a providential blessing to him.",
      "Of course for me, as his mother, it s terrible; and what s worse, they say, _ce n est pas tr s bien vu P tersbourg_.",
      "But it can t be helped!",
      "It was the one thing that could rouse him.",
      "Yashvin a friend of his he had lost all he had at cards and he was going to Servia.",
      "He came to see him and persuaded him to go.",
      "Now it s an interest for him.",
      "Do please talk to him a little.",
      "I want to distract his mind.",
      "He s so low-spirited.",
      "And as bad luck would have it, he has toothache too.",
      "But he ll be delighted to see you.",
      "Please do talk to him; he s walking up and down on that side.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over to the other side of the station.",
      "Chapter 5 In the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the platform, Vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat, with his hands in his pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage, turning sharply after twenty paces.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he approached him, that Vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see.",
      "This did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest.",
      "He was above all personal considerations with Vronsky.",
      "At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an important part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his duty to encourage him and express his approval.",
      "He went up to him.",
      "Vronsky stood still, looked intently at him, recognized him, and going a few steps forward to meet him, shook hands with him very warmly.",
      "Possibly you didn t wish to see me, said Sergey Ivanovitch, but couldn t I be of use to you?",
      "There s no one I should less dislike seeing than you, said Vronsky.",
      "Excuse me; and there s nothing in life for me to like.",
      "I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my services, said Sergey Ivanovitch, scanning Vronsky s face, full of unmistakable suffering.",
      "Wouldn t it be of use to you to have a letter to Ristitch to Milan?",
      "Vronsky said, seeming to understand him with difficulty.",
      "If you don t mind, let s walk on.",
      "It s so stuffy among the carriages.",
      "A letter?",
      "No, thank you; to meet death one needs no letters of introduction.",
      "Nor for the Turks.... he said, with a smile that was merely of the lips.",
      "His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.",
      "Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are after all essential, with anyone prepared to see you.",
      "But that s as you like.",
      "I was very glad to hear of your intention.",
      "There have been so many attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like you raises them in public estimation.",
      "My use as a man, said Vronsky, is that life s worth nothing to me.",
      "And that I ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks, and to trample on them or fall I know that.",
      "I m glad there s something to give my life for, for it s not simply useless but loathsome to me.",
      "Anyone s welcome to it.",
      "And his jaw twitched impatiently from the incessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him from even speaking with a natural expression.",
      "You will become another man, I predict, said Sergey Ivanovitch, feeling touched.",
      "To deliver one s brother-men from bondage is an aim worth death and life.",
      "God grant you success outwardly and inwardly peace, he added, and he held out his hand.",
      "Vronsky warmly pressed his outstretched hand.",
      "Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use.",
      "But as a man, I m a wreck, he jerked out.",
      "He could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth, that were like rows of ivory in his mouth.",
      "He was silent, and his eyes rested on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along the rails.",
      "And all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble, that set his whole being in anguish, made him for an instant forget his toothache.",
      "As he glanced at the tender and the rails, under the influence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his misfortune, he suddenly recalled _her_ that is, what was left of her when he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway station on the table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the bloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back with its weight of hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and the exquisite face, with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed expression, piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that seemed to utter that fearful phrase that he would be sorry for it that she had said when they were quarreling.",
      "And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time, at a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and giving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on that last moment.",
      "He tried to recall his best moments with her, but those moments were poisoned forever.",
      "He could only think of her as triumphant, successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never to be effaced.",
      "He lost all consciousness of toothache, and his face worked with sobs.",
      "Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining his self-possession, he addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly: You have had no telegrams since yesterday s?",
      "Yes, driven back for a third time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.",
      "And after talking a little more of King Milan s proclamation, and the immense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages on hearing the second bell.",
      "Chapter 6 Sergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet him, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow.",
      "Levin was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as Moors from the dust of the road.",
      "Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her father and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet him.",
      "What a shame not to have let us know, she said, giving her hand to Sergey Ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.",
      "We drove here capitally, and have not put you out, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I m so dirty.",
      "I m afraid to touch you.",
      "I ve been so busy, I didn t know when I should be able to tear myself away.",
      "And so you re still as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness, he said, smiling, out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater.",
      "Here s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting here at last.",
      "But I m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash, said Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled, his teeth flashing white in his black face.",
      "Kostya will be delighted.",
      "He has gone to his settlement.",
      "It s time he should be home.",
      "Busy as ever with his farming.",
      "It really is a peaceful backwater, said Katavasov; while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.",
      "Well, how does our friend look at it?",
      "He s sure not to think like other people.",
      "Oh, I don t know, like everybody else, Kitty answered, a little embarrassed, looking round at Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I ll send to fetch him.",
      "Papa s staying with us.",
      "He s only just come home from abroad.",
      "And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash, one in his room and the other in what had been Dolly s, and giving orders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during the months of her pregnancy.",
      "It s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor, she said.",
      "Oh, that s a bore in this heat, said the prince.",
      "No, papa, he s very nice, and Kostya s very fond of him, Kitty said, with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father s face.",
      "Oh, I didn t say anything.",
      "You go to them, darling, said Kitty to her sister, and entertain them.",
      "They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well.",
      "And I must run to Mitya.",
      "As ill-luck would have it, I haven t fed him since tea.",
      "He s awake now, and sure to be screaming.",
      "And feeling a rush of milk, she hurried to the nursery.",
      "This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so close, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food, and knew for certain he was hungry.",
      "She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery.",
      "And he was indeed crying.",
      "She heard him and hastened.",
      "But the faster she went, the louder he screamed.",
      "It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.",
      "Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?",
      "said Kitty hurriedly, seating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.",
      "But give me him quickly.",
      "Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are!",
      "There, tie the cap afterwards, do!",
      "The baby s greedy scream was passing into sobs.",
      "But you can t manage so, ma am, said Agafea Mihalovna, who was almost always to be found in the nursery.",
      "He must be put straight.",
      "A-oo!",
      "she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.",
      "The nurse brought the baby to his mother.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna followed him with a face dissolving with tenderness.",
      "He knows me, he knows me.",
      "In God s faith, Katerina Alexandrovna, ma am, he knew me!",
      "Agafea Mihalovna cried above the baby s screams.",
      "But Kitty did not hear her words.",
      "Her impatience kept growing, like the baby s. Their impatience hindered things for a while.",
      "The baby could not get hold of the breast right, and was furious.",
      "At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking, things went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed, and both subsided into calm.",
      "But poor darling, he s all in perspiration!",
      "said Kitty in a whisper, touching the baby.",
      "What makes you think he knows you?",
      "she added, with a sidelong glance at the baby s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed hand he was waving.",
      "If he knew anyone, he would have known me, said Kitty, in response to Agafea Mihalovna s statement, and she smiled.",
      "She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart she was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna, but that he knew and understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too that no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come to understand only through him.",
      "To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to his grandfather, to his father even, Mitya was a living being, requiring only material care, but for his mother he had long been a mortal being, with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual relations already.",
      "When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself.",
      "Then when I do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling!",
      "Simply beams like a sunny day!",
      "Well, well; then we shall see, whispered Kitty.",
      "But now go away, he s going to sleep.",
      "Chapter 7 Agafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind, chased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a bumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded branch of birch over the mother and the baby.",
      "if God would send a drop of rain, she said.",
      "Yes, yes, sh sh sh was all Kitty answered, rocking a little, and tenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of fat at the wrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes.",
      "That hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand, but was afraid to for fear of waking the baby.",
      "At last the little hand ceased waving, and the eyes closed.",
      "Only from time to time, as he went on sucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight.",
      "The nurse had left off fanning, and was dozing.",
      "From above came the peals of the old prince s voice, and the chuckle of Katavasov.",
      "They have got into talk without me, thought Kitty, but still it s vexing that Kostya s out.",
      "He s sure to have gone to the bee-house again.",
      "Though it s a pity he s there so often, still I m glad.",
      "It distracts his mind.",
      "He s become altogether happier and better now than in the spring.",
      "He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt frightened for him.",
      "And how absurd he is!",
      "She knew what worried her husband.",
      "It was his unbelief.",
      "Although, if she had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life, if he did not believe, he would be damned, she would have had to admit that he would be damned, his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness.",
      "And she, confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and loving her husband s soul more than anything in the world, thought with a smile of his unbelief, and told herself that he was absurd.",
      "What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?",
      "she wondered.",
      "If it s all written in those books, he can understand them.",
      "If it s all wrong, why does he read them?",
      "He says himself that he would like to believe.",
      "Then why is it he doesn t believe?",
      "Surely from his thinking so much?",
      "And he thinks so much from being solitary.",
      "He s always alone, alone.",
      "He can t talk about it all to us.",
      "I fancy he ll be glad of these visitors, especially Katavasov.",
      "He likes discussions with them, she thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of where it would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to share Sergey Ivanovitch s room.",
      "And then an idea suddenly struck her, which made her shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely at her.",
      "I do believe the laundress hasn t sent the washing yet, and all the best sheets are in use.",
      "If I don t see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will give Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets, and at the very idea of this the blood rushed to Kitty s face.",
      "Yes, I will arrange it, she decided, and going back to her former thoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had been interrupted, and she began to recall what.",
      "Yes, Kostya, an unbeliever, she thought again with a smile.",
      "Well, an unbeliever then!",
      "Better let him always be one than like Madame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad.",
      "No, he won t ever sham anything.",
      "And a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind.",
      "A fortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to Dolly.",
      "He besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his debts.",
      "Dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him, pitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property.",
      "After that, with an irrepressible smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her husband s shamefaced embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the subject, and how at last, having thought of the one means of helping Dolly without wounding her pride, he had suggested to Kitty what had not occurred to her before that she should give up her share of the property.",
      "He an unbeliever indeed!",
      "With his heart, his dread of offending anyone, even a child!",
      "Everything for others, nothing for himself.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya s duty to be his steward.",
      "And it s the same with his sister.",
      "Now Dolly and her children are under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every day, as though he were bound to be at their service.",
      "Yes, only be like your father, only like him, she said, handing Mitya over to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek.",
      "Chapter 8 Ever since, by his beloved brother s deathbed, Levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs he had been stricken with horror, not so much of death, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how, and what it was.",
      "The physical organization, its decay, the indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.",
      "These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for intellectual purposes.",
      "But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin felt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a muslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is immediately convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he is as good as naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.",
      "From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still went on living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his lack of knowledge.",
      "He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions were not merely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of ideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.",
      "At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had completely crowded out these thoughts.",
      "But of late, while he was staying in Moscow after his wife s confinement, with nothing to do, the question that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and more insistently, haunted Levin s mind.",
      "The question was summed up for him thus: If I do not accept the answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do I accept?",
      "And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from finding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find anything at all like an answer.",
      "He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool shops.",
      "Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation, with every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these questions and their solution.",
      "What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority of men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old beliefs for the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this, and were perfectly satisfied and serene.",
      "So that, apart from the principal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too.",
      "Were these people sincere?",
      "he asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
      "or was it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems in some different, clearer sense than he did?",
      "And he assiduously studied both these men s opinions and the books which treated of these scientific explanations.",
      "One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind, was that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of the circle of his young days at college, that religion had outlived its day, and that it was now practically non-existent.",
      "All the people nearest to him who were good in their lives were believers.",
      "The old prince, and Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all the women believed, and his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian people, all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest respect, believed.",
      "Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many scientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.",
      "Moreover, during his wife s confinement, something had happened that seemed extraordinary to him.",
      "He, an unbeliever, had fallen into praying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed.",
      "But that moment had passed, and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into the rest of his life.",
      "He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and that now he was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it, it all fell to pieces.",
      "He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for his spiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it was a proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments.",
      "He was miserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual forces to the utmost to escape from this condition.",
      "Chapter 9 These doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger from time to time, but never leaving him.",
      "He read and thought, and the more he read and the more he thought, the further he felt from the aim he was pursuing.",
      "Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and re-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation of life.",
      "Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself seeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the materialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a solution of problems, the same thing always happened.",
      "As long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit, will, freedom, essence,_ purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend something.",
      "But he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in life more important than reason.",
      "At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his _will_ the word _love_, and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him, till he removed a little away from it.",
      "But then, when he turned from life itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved to be the same muslin garment with no warmth in it.",
      "His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of Homiakov.",
      "Levin read the second volume of Homiakov s works, and in spite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at first repelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found in them.",
      "He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of men bound together by love to the church.",
      "What delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head, and therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in God, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God, a mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc.",
      "But afterwards, on reading a Catholic writer s history of the church, and then a Greek orthodox writer s history of the church, and seeing that the two churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority of the other, Homiakov s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers edifices.",
      "All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of horror.",
      "Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life s impossible; and that I can t know, and so I can t live, Levin said to himself.",
      "In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that bubble is Me.",
      "It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages of human thought in that direction.",
      "This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by human thought in almost all their ramifications rested.",
      "It was the prevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had unconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the clearest, and made it his own.",
      "But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked power, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.",
      "He must escape from this power.",
      "And the means of escape every man had in his own hands.",
      "He had but to cut short this dependence on evil.",
      "And there was one means death.",
      "And Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several times so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted to hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of shooting himself.",
      "But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he went on living.",
      "Chapter 10 When Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could find no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left off questioning himself about it.",
      "It seemed as though he knew both what he was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely and without hesitation.",
      "Indeed, in these latter days he was far more decided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.",
      "When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back also to his usual pursuits.",
      "The management of the estate, his relations with the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the management of his sister s and brother s property, of which he had the direction, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his child, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring, filled all his time.",
      "These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had completely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing that he could not do otherwise.",
      "In former days almost from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it vanished into nothing.",
      "But now, since his marriage, when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing, he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.",
      "Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil like a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside the furrow.",
      "To live the same family life as his father and forefathers that is, in the same condition of culture and to bring up his children in the same, was incontestably necessary.",
      "It was as necessary as dining when one was hungry.",
      "And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was necessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so as to yield an income.",
      "Just as incontestably as it was necessary to repay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition that his son, when he received it as a heritage, would say thank you to his father as Levin had said thank you to his grandfather for all he built and planted.",
      "And to do this it was necessary to look after the land himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields, and plant timber.",
      "It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch, of his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were accustomed to do so as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one s arms.",
      "It was necessary to look after the comfort of his sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it was impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.",
      "And all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up the whole of Levin s life, which had no meaning at all for him, when he began to think.",
      "But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just the same way _how_ he had to do it all, and what was more important than the rest.",
      "He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men under bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of wages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable.",
      "Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was what he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern and the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income.",
      "Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could not exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though it annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their cattle on his land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment.",
      "To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent.",
      "a month, he must lend a sum of money to set him free.",
      "But he could not let off peasants who did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears.",
      "It was impossible to overlook the bailiff s not having mown the meadows and letting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres where a young copse had been planted.",
      "It was impossible to excuse a laborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was dying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from his pay those costly months of idleness.",
      "But it was impossible not to allow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for anything.",
      "Levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife, who was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three hours to see him could wait a little longer.",
      "He knew too that, regardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm, he must forego that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone, while he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the bee-house.",
      "Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and far from trying to prove that he was, nowadays he avoided all thought or talk about it.",
      "Reasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing what he ought to do and what he ought not.",
      "When he did not think, but simply lived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act rightly, he was at once aware of it.",
      "So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life.",
      "Chapter 11 The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of Levin s most painful days.",
      "It was the very busiest working time, when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in labor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every year, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.",
      "To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows, turn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn all this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep.",
      "And every year this is done all over Russia.",
      "Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the closest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy time that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the people.",
      "In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and to the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home at the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he drank coffee with them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to be set working to get ready the seed-corn.",
      "He was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of the hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the new thatch roof.",
      "He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the crevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark, dusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts.",
      "Why is it all being done?",
      "Why am I standing here, making them work?",
      "What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal before me?",
      "What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for?",
      "(I doctored her, when the beam fell on her in the fire) he thought, looking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain, moving painfully with her bare, sun-blackened feet over the uneven, rough floor.",
      "Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she won t; they ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action shakes the ears out of their husks.",
      "They ll bury her and this piebald horse, and very soon too, he thought, gazing at the heavily moving, panting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him.",
      "And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders they will bury him.",
      "He s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the women, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel.",
      "And what s more, it s not them alone me they ll bury too, and nothing will be left.",
      "He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how much they thrashed in an hour.",
      "He wanted to know this so as to judge by it the task to set for the day.",
      "It ll soon be one, and they re only beginning the third sheaf, thought Levin.",
      "He went up to the man that was feeding the machine, and shouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more slowly.",
      "You put in too much at a time, Fyodor.",
      "Do you see it gets choked, that s why it isn t getting on.",
      "Do it evenly.",
      "Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted something in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want him to.",
      "Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding the corn in himself.",
      "Working on till the peasants dinner hour, which was not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell into talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed.",
      "Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin had once allotted land to his cooperative association.",
      "Now it had been let to a former house porter.",
      "Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a well-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village, would not take the land for the coming year.",
      "It s a high rent; it wouldn t pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, answered the peasant, picking the ears off his sweat-drenched shirt.",
      "But how does Kirillov make it pay?",
      "Mituh!",
      "(so the peasant called the house porter, in a tone of contempt), you may be sure he ll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "He ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it!",
      "He s no mercy on a Christian.",
      "But Uncle Fokanitch (so he called the old peasant Platon), do you suppose he d flay the skin off a man?",
      "Where there s debt, he ll let anyone off.",
      "And he ll not wring the last penny out.",
      "He s a man too.",
      "But why will he let anyone off?",
      "Oh, well, of course, folks are different.",
      "One man lives for his own wants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his belly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man.",
      "He lives for his soul.",
      "He does not forget God.",
      "How thinks of God?",
      "How does he live for his soul?",
      "Levin almost shouted.",
      "Why, to be sure, in truth, in God s way.",
      "Folks are different.",
      "Take you now, you wouldn t wrong a man....",
      "Yes, yes, good-bye!",
      "said Levin, breathless with excitement, and turning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home.",
      "At the peasant s words that Fokanitch lived for his soul, in truth, in God s way, undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as though they had been locked up, and all striving towards one goal, they thronged whirling through his head, blinding him with their light.",
      "Chapter 12 Levin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts (he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition, unlike anything he had experienced before.",
      "The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric shock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the whole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly occupied his mind.",
      "These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind even when he was talking about the land.",
      "He was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested this new thing, not yet knowing what it was.",
      "Not living for his own wants, but for God?",
      "For what God?",
      "And could one say anything more senseless than what he said?",
      "He said that one must not live for one s own wants, that is, that one must not live for what we understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live for something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor even define.",
      "What of it?",
      "Didn t I understand those senseless words of Fyodor s?",
      "And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth?",
      "Did I think them stupid, obscure, inexact?",
      "No, I understood him, and exactly as he understands the words.",
      "I understood them more fully and clearly than I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted nor can I doubt about it.",
      "And not only I, but everyone, the whole world understands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no doubt and are always agreed.",
      "And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle which would convince me.",
      "A material miracle would have persuaded me.",
      "And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing, surrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!",
      "Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly.",
      "That s comprehensible and rational.",
      "All of us as rational beings can t do anything else but live for our belly.",
      "And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one mustn t live for one s belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at a hint I understand him!",
      "And I and millions of men, men who lived ages ago and men living now peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned, who have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying the same thing we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must live for and what is good.",
      "I and all men have only one firm, incontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained by the reason it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no effects.",
      "If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a reward, it is not goodness either.",
      "So goodness is outside the chain of cause and effect.",
      "And yet I know it, and we all know it.",
      "What could be a greater miracle than that?",
      "Can I have found the solution of it all?",
      "can my sufferings be over?",
      "thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing the heat nor his weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged suffering.",
      "This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him incredible.",
      "He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going farther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the shade of an aspen on the uncut grass.",
      "He took his hat off his hot head and lay propped on his elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.",
      "Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand, he thought, looking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed.",
      "What have I discovered?",
      "he asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goat-weed out of the beetle s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the beetle to cross over onto it.",
      "What is it makes me glad?",
      "I have discovered nothing.",
      "I have only found out what I knew.",
      "I understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives me life.",
      "I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.",
      "Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass and of this beetle (there, she didn t care for the grass, she s opened her wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation of matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.",
      "And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty patches, there was a process of evolution.",
      "Evolution from what?",
      "into what?",
      "Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal!",
      "And I was astonished that in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not discover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.",
      "Now I say that I know the meaning of my life: To live for God, for my soul.",
      "And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and marvelous.",
      "Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing.",
      "Yes, pride, he said to himself, turning over on his stomach and beginning to tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.",
      "And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect.",
      "And most of all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect.",
      "The cheating knavishness of intellect, that s it, he said to himself.",
      "And he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his ideas during the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear confronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill. Then, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too, there was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he had made up his mind that life was impossible like that, and that he must either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him as the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.",
      "But he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and feeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys and had been happy, when he was not thinking of the meaning of his life.",
      "What did this mean?",
      "It meant that he had been living rightly, but thinking wrongly.",
      "He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that he had sucked in with his mother s milk, but he had thought, not merely without recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring them.",
      "Now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the beliefs in which he had been brought up.",
      "What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and not for my own desires?",
      "I should have robbed and lied and killed.",
      "Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed for me.",
      "And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not conceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not known what he was living for.",
      "I looked for an answer to my question.",
      "And thought could not give an answer to my question it is incommensurable with my question.",
      "The answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.",
      "And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any way, it was given to me as to all men, _given_, because I could not have got it from anywhere.",
      "Where could I have got it?",
      "By reason could I have arrived at knowing that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him?",
      "I was told that in my childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already in my soul.",
      "But who discovered it?",
      "Not reason.",
      "Reason discovered the struggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who hinder the satisfaction of our desires.",
      "That is the deduction of reason.",
      "But loving one s neighbor reason could never discover, because it s irrational.",
      "Chapter 13 And Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and her children.",
      "The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking raspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other s mouths with a syringe.",
      "Their mother, catching them at these pranks, began reminding them in Levin s presence of the trouble their mischief gave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their sake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to drink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would have nothing to eat, and die of hunger.",
      "And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which the children heard what their mother said to them.",
      "They were simply annoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not believe a word of what their mother was saying.",
      "They could not believe it indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they habitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived by.",
      "That all comes of itself, they thought, and there s nothing interesting or important about it because it has always been so, and always will be so.",
      "And it s all always the same.",
      "We ve no need to think about that, it s all ready.",
      "But we want to invent something of our own, and new.",
      "So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking them over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other s mouths.",
      "That s fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than drinking out of cups.",
      "Isn t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of the life of man?",
      "And don t all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him to a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so certainly that he could not live at all without it?",
      "Isn t it distinctly to be seen in the development of each philosopher s theory, that he knows what is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what everyone knows?",
      "Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on.",
      "Would they be naughty then?",
      "Why, they d die of hunger!",
      "Well, then, leave us with our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the Creator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of moral evil.",
      "Just try and build up anything without those ideas!",
      "We only try to destroy them, because we re spiritually provided for.",
      "Exactly like the children!",
      "Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that alone gives peace to my soul?",
      "Whence did I get it?",
      "Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and living on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them, and destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by.",
      "And as soon as an important moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold and hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when their mother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.",
      "Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me, revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief thing taught by the church.",
      "The church!",
      "Levin repeated to himself.",
      "He turned over on the other side, and leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing into the distance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.",
      "But can I believe in all the church teaches?",
      "he thought, trying himself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his present peace of mind.",
      "Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the church which had always seemed most strange and had always been a stumbling block to him.",
      "The Creation?",
      "But how did I explain existence?",
      "By existence?",
      "By nothing?",
      "The devil and sin.",
      "But how do I explain evil?...",
      "The atonement?...",
      "But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been told to me and all men.",
      "And it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of the church which could destroy the chief thing faith in God, in goodness, as the one goal of man s destiny.",
      "Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in the service of truth instead of one s desires.",
      "And each doctrine did not simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to complete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made it possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise men and imbeciles, old men and children all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty, beggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to build up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and which alone is precious to us.",
      "Lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky.",
      "Do I not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
      "But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.",
      "Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious voices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.",
      "Can this be faith?",
      "he thought, afraid to believe in his happiness.",
      "My God, I thank Thee!",
      "he said, gulping down his sobs, and with both hands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes.",
      "Chapter 14 Levin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle, then he caught sight of his trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up to the herd, said something to the herdsman.",
      "Then he heard the rattle of the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him.",
      "But he was so buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman had come for him.",
      "He only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him and shouted to him.",
      "The mistress sent me.",
      "Your brother has come, and some gentleman with him.",
      "Levin got into the trap and took the reins.",
      "As though just roused out of sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his faculties.",
      "He stared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and on his neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman sitting beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother, thought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother.",
      "And his brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite different from before.",
      "He fancied that now his relations with all men would be different.",
      "With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used to be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be friendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be different.",
      "Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with impatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan sitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand, continually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to find something to start a conversation about with him.",
      "He would have said that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was like blame, and he longed for friendly, warm talk.",
      "Nothing else occurred to him.",
      "Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump, said the coachman, pulling the rein Levin held.",
      "Please don t touch and don t teach me!",
      "said Levin, angered by this interference.",
      "Now, as always, interference made him angry, and he felt sorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his spiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with reality.",
      "He was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya running to meet him.",
      "Uncle Kostya!",
      "mamma s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and someone else, they said, clambering up into the trap.",
      "An awfully terrible person!",
      "And he does like this with his arms, said Tanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.",
      "Old or young?",
      "asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone, he did not know whom, by Tanya s performance.",
      "Oh, I hope it s not a tiresome person!",
      "As soon as he turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming, Levin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his arms just as Tanya had shown him.",
      "Katavasov was very fond of discussing metaphysics, having derived his notions from natural science writers who had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many arguments with him of late.",
      "And one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered that he came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he recognized him.",
      "No, whatever I do, I won t argue and give utterance to my ideas lightly, he thought.",
      "Getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov, Levin asked about his wife.",
      "She has taken Mitya to Kolok (a copse near the house).",
      "She meant to have him out there because it s so hot indoors, said Dolly.",
      "Levin had always advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it unsafe, and he was not pleased to hear this.",
      "She rushes about from place to place with him, said the prince, smiling.",
      "I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.",
      "She meant to come to the bee-house.",
      "She thought you would be there.",
      "We are going there, said Dolly.",
      "Well, and what are you doing?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, falling back from the rest and walking beside him.",
      "Oh, nothing special.",
      "Busy as usual with the land, answered Levin.",
      "Well, and what about you?",
      "Come for long?",
      "We have been expecting you for such a long time.",
      "Only for a fortnight.",
      "I ve a great deal to do in Moscow.",
      "At these words the brothers eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the desire he always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on affectionate and still more open terms with his brother, felt an awkwardness in looking at him.",
      "He dropped his eyes and did not know what to say.",
      "Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to Sergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him off the subject of the Servian war and the Slavonic question, at which he had hinted by the allusion to what he had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey Ivanovitch s book.",
      "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.",
      "No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone, he said.",
      "Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower, he added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree-tops.",
      "And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers that tone hardly hostile, but chilly which Levin had been so longing to avoid.",
      "Levin went up to Katavasov.",
      "It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come, he said to him.",
      "I ve been meaning to a long while.",
      "Now we shall have some discussion, we ll see to that.",
      "Have you been reading Spencer?",
      "No, I ve not finished reading him, said Levin.",
      "But I don t need him now.",
      "How s that?",
      "that s interesting.",
      "I mean that I m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that interest me I shall never find in him and his like.",
      "Now....",
      "But Katavasov s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him, and he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood, which he was unmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he remembered his resolution and stopped short.",
      "But we ll talk later on, he added.",
      "If we re going to the bee-house, it s this way, along this little path, he said, addressing them all.",
      "Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart s-ease among which stood up here and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his guests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be afraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread, cucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.",
      "Trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible, and listening to the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him, he walked along the little path to the hut.",
      "In the very entry one bee hummed angrily, caught in his beard, but he carefully extricated it.",
      "Going into the shady outer room, he took down from the wall his veil, that hung on a peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, he went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in the midst of a closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast on posts, all the hives he knew so well, the old stocks, each with its own history, and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year.",
      "In front of the openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives.",
      "His ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the busy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the lazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their property from the enemy and preparing to sting.",
      "On the farther side of the fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he did not see Levin.",
      "Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did not call him.",
      "He was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of ordinary actual life, which had already depressed his happy mood.",
      "He thought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to show coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.",
      "Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no trace?",
      "But the same instant, going back to his mood, he felt with delight that something new and important had happened to him.",
      "Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had found, but it was still untouched within him.",
      "Just as the bees, whirling round him, now menacing him and distracting his attention, prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace, forced him to restrain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty cares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap restricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he was among them.",
      "Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in spite of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just become aware of.",
      "Chapter 15 Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his way here?",
      "said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children; with Vronsky!",
      "He s going to Servia.",
      "And not alone; he s taking a squadron out with him at his own expense, said Katavasov.",
      "That s the right thing for him, said Levin.",
      "Are volunteers still going out then?",
      "he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer.",
      "He was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb.",
      "You should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday!",
      "said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber.",
      "Well, what is one to make of it?",
      "For mercy s sake, do explain to me, Sergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they fighting with?",
      "asked the old prince, unmistakably taking up a conversation that had sprung up in Levin s absence.",
      "With the Turks, Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he extricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf.",
      "But who has declared war on the Turks?",
      "Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?",
      "No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors sufferings and are eager to help them, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But the prince is not speaking of help, said Levin, coming to the assistance of his father-in-law, but of war.",
      "The prince says that private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the government.",
      "Kostya, mind, that s a bee!",
      "Really, they ll sting us!",
      "said Dolly, waving away a wasp.",
      "But that s not a bee, it s a wasp, said Levin.",
      "Well now, well, what s your own theory?",
      "Katavasov said to Levin with a smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion.",
      "Why have not private persons the right to do so?",
      "Oh, my theory s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars; that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this, and is driven inevitably into war.",
      "On the other hand, both political science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their personal individual will.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began speaking at the same time.",
      "But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will, said Katavasov.",
      "But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer.",
      "His brows contracted at Katavasov s words and he said something else.",
      "You don t put the matter in its true light.",
      "There is no question here of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian feeling.",
      "Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being massacred.",
      "Even supposing they were not our brothers nor fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.",
      "Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a woman or a child I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and protect the victim.",
      "But I should not kill them, said Levin.",
      "Yes, you would kill them.",
      "If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the moment, but I can t say beforehand.",
      "And such a momentary impulse there is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the Slavonic peoples.",
      "Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is, said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning with displeasure.",
      "There are traditions still extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the unclean sons of Hagar.",
      "The people have heard of the sufferings of their brethren and have spoken.",
      "Perhaps so, said Levin evasively; but I don t see it.",
      "I m one of the people myself, and I don t feel it.",
      "Here am I too, said the old prince.",
      "I ve been staying abroad and reading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian atrocities, I couldn t make out why it was all the Russians were all of a sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn t feel the slightest affection for them.",
      "I was very much upset, thought I was a monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me.",
      "But since I have been here, my mind s been set at rest.",
      "I see that there are people besides me who re only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic brethren.",
      "Here s Konstantin too.",
      "Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case, said Sergey Ivanovitch; it s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia the whole people has expressed its will.",
      "But excuse me, I don t see that.",
      "The people don t know anything about it, if you come to that, said the old prince.",
      "Oh, papa!...",
      "how can you say that?",
      "And last Sunday in church?",
      "said Dolly, listening to the conversation.",
      "Please give me a cloth, she said to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile.",
      "Why, it s not possible that all....",
      "But what was it in church on Sunday?",
      "The priest had been told to read that.",
      "He read it.",
      "They didn t understand a word of it.",
      "Then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church; well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they couldn t say.",
      "The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance, said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at the old bee-keeper.",
      "The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair, stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it.",
      "That s so, no doubt, he said, with a significant shake of his head at Sergey Ivanovitch s words.",
      "Here, then, ask him.",
      "He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing, said Levin.",
      "Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch?",
      "he said, turning to him.",
      "What they read in the church?",
      "Ought we to fight for the Christians?",
      "What should we think?",
      "Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things.",
      "It s clearer for him to see.",
      "Shall I bring a bit more bread?",
      "Give the little lad some more?",
      "he said addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing to Grisha, who had finished his crust.",
      "I don t need to ask, said Sergey Ivanovitch, we have seen and are seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve a just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly express their thought and aim.",
      "They bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for.",
      "It means, to my thinking, said Levin, who was beginning to get warm, that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste, ne er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere to Pogatchev s bands, to Khiva, to Servia....",
      "I tell you that it s not a case of hundreds or of ne er-do-wells, but the best representatives of the people!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune.",
      "And what of the subscriptions?",
      "In this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will.",
      "That word people is so vague, said Levin.",
      "Parish clerks, teachers, and one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it s all about.",
      "The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing their will, haven t the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about.",
      "What right have we to say that this is the people s will?",
      "Chapter 16 Sergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at once turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.",
      "Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical computation, of course it s very difficult to arrive at it.",
      "And voting has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of reaching that.",
      "It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart.",
      "I won t speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the people, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at society in the narrow sense.",
      "All the most diverse sections of the educated public, hostile before, are merged in one.",
      "Every division is at an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over again, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is carrying them in one direction.",
      "Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing, said the prince.",
      "That s true.",
      "But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak before a storm.",
      "One can hear nothing for them.",
      "Frogs or no frogs, I m not the editor of a paper and I don t want to defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual world, said Sergey Ivanovitch, addressing his brother.",
      "Levin would have answered, but the old prince interrupted him.",
      "Well, about that unanimity, that s another thing, one may say, said the prince.",
      "There s my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevitch, you know him.",
      "He s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or other, I don t remember.",
      "Only there s nothing to do in it why, Dolly, it s no secret!",
      "and a salary of eight thousand.",
      "You try asking him whether his post is of use, he ll prove to you that it s most necessary.",
      "And he s a truthful man too, but there s no refusing to believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles.",
      "Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the post, said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the prince s remark to be ill-timed.",
      "So it is with the unanimity of the press.",
      "That s been explained to me: as soon as there s war their incomes are doubled.",
      "How can they help believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and all that?",
      "I don t care for many of the papers, but that s unjust, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I would only make one condition, pursued the old prince.",
      "Alphonse Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: You consider war to be inevitable?",
      "Let everyone who advocates war be enrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of every storm, of every attack, to lead them all!",
      "A nice lot the editors would make!",
      "said Katavasov, with a loud roar, as he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.",
      "But they d run, said Dolly, they d only be in the way.",
      "Oh, if they ran away, then we d have grape-shot or Cossacks with whips behind them, said the prince.",
      "But that s a joke, and a poor one too, if you ll excuse my saying so, prince, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I don t see that it was a joke, that.... Levin was beginning, but Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.",
      "Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work, said he.",
      "And men of thought are doing their work when they express public opinion.",
      "And the single-hearted and full expression of public opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at the same time.",
      "Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we have heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that is a great step and a proof of strength.",
      "But it s not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks, said Levin timidly.",
      "The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices for their soul, but not for murder, he added, instinctively connecting the conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind.",
      "For their soul?",
      "That s a most puzzling expression for a natural science man, do you understand?",
      "What sort of thing is the soul?",
      "said Katavasov, smiling.",
      "Oh, you know!",
      "No, by God, I haven t the faintest idea!",
      "said Katavasov with a loud roar of laughter.",
      "I bring not peace, but a sword, says Christ, Sergey Ivanovitch rejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest thing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin most.",
      "That s so, no doubt, the old man repeated again.",
      "He was standing near them and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction.",
      "Ah, my dear fellow, you re defeated, utterly defeated!",
      "cried Katavasov good-humoredly.",
      "Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.",
      "No, I can t argue with them, he thought; they wear impenetrable armor, while I m naked.",
      "He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov, and he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them.",
      "What they advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his ruin.",
      "He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his brother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder.",
      "He could not admit this, because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living, nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.",
      "He said as Mihalitch did and the people, who had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the Varyagi: Be princes and rule over us.",
      "Gladly we promise complete submission.",
      "All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.",
      "And now, according to Sergey Ivanovitch s account, the people had foregone this privilege they had bought at such a costly price.",
      "He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide, then why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement in favor of the Slavonic peoples?",
      "But these were merely thoughts that could settle nothing.",
      "One thing could be seen beyond doubt that was that at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey Ivanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it.",
      "And Levin ceased speaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that the storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home before it rained.",
      "Chapter 17 The old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off; the rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.",
      "But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain.",
      "The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke, rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky.",
      "They were still two hundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and every second the downpour might be looked for.",
      "The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her legs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on the children.",
      "The men of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside her.",
      "They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the edge of the iron guttering.",
      "The children and their elders after them ran into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.",
      "Katerina Alexandrovna?",
      "Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna, who met them with kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.",
      "We thought she was with you, she said.",
      "And Mitya?",
      "In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.",
      "Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.",
      "In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering the sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse.",
      "Stubbornly, as though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one side acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops.",
      "The peasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the servants quarters.",
      "The streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse.",
      "The wet of the rain spurting up in tiny drops could be smelt in the air.",
      "Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree, when there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead.",
      "Opening his blinded eyes, Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position.",
      "Can it have been struck?",
      "Levin hardly had time to think when, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the other trees, and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the others.",
      "The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous chill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of terror.",
      "not on them!",
      "And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they should not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he repeated it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this senseless prayer.",
      "Running up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them there.",
      "They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they were calling him.",
      "Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light summer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over something.",
      "It was Kitty with the nurse.",
      "The rain was already ceasing, and it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them.",
      "The nurse was not wet on the lower part of her dress, but Kitty was drenched through, and her soaked clothes clung to her.",
      "Though the rain was over, they still stood in the same position in which they had been standing when the storm broke.",
      "Both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella.",
      "Alive?",
      "Unhurt?",
      "he said, splashing with his soaked boots through the standing water and running up to them.",
      "Kitty s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled timidly under her shapeless sopped hat.",
      "Aren t you ashamed of yourself?",
      "I can t think how you can be so reckless!",
      "he said angrily to his wife.",
      "It wasn t my fault, really.",
      "We were just meaning to go, when he made such a to-do that we had to change him.",
      "We were just.... Kitty began defending herself.",
      "Mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.",
      "Well, thank God!",
      "I don t know what I m saying!",
      "They gathered up the baby s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the baby and carried it.",
      "Levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for having been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking.",
      "Chapter 18 During the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations in which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind, in spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in himself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness of his heart.",
      "After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm clouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black and thundery, on the rim of the sky.",
      "The whole party spent the rest of the day in the house.",
      "No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner everyone was in the most amiable frame of mind.",
      "At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which always pleased people on their first acquaintance with him.",
      "Then Sergey Ivanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting observations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common houseflies, and their life.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good spirits, and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the future of the Eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well, that everyone listened eagerly.",
      "Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all she was summoned to give Mitya his bath.",
      "A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come to the nursery.",
      "Leaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting conversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been sent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to the nursery.",
      "Although he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch s views of the new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of forty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception quite new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at being sent for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing-room and was alone, his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning.",
      "And all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the history of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was passing in his own soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped back into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.",
      "He did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of thought that he did not need.",
      "He fell back at once into the feeling which had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts, and he found that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than before.",
      "He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to find comforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find the feeling.",
      "Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was keener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.",
      "He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out in the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered.",
      "Yes, looking at the sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I thought something, I shirked facing something, he mused.",
      "But whatever it was, there can be no disproving it!",
      "I have but to think, and all will come clear!",
      "Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had shirked facing.",
      "It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His revelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to the Christian church alone?",
      "What relation to this revelation have the beliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?",
      "It seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.",
      "Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the bath.",
      "Hearing her husband s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning him to her with her smile.",
      "With one hand she was supporting the fat baby that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other she squeezed the sponge over him.",
      "Come, look, look!",
      "she said, when her husband came up to her.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna s right.",
      "He knows us!",
      "Mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of recognizing all his friends.",
      "As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it was completely successful.",
      "The cook, sent for with this object, bent over the baby.",
      "He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly.",
      "Kitty bent down to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on the sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound with his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their admiration.",
      "Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.",
      "The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.",
      "Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him, said Kitty to her husband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place, with the baby at her breast.",
      "I am so glad!",
      "It had begun to distress me.",
      "You said you had no feeling for him.",
      "No; did I say that?",
      "I only said I was disappointed.",
      "disappointed in him?",
      "Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more.",
      "I had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.",
      "And then instead of that disgust, pity.... She listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving Mitya his bath.",
      "And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than pleasure.",
      "Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand how I love him.",
      "Kitty s smile was radiant.",
      "Were you very much frightened?",
      "So was I too, but I feel it more now that it s over.",
      "I m going to look at the oak.",
      "How nice Katavasov is!",
      "And what a happy day we ve had altogether.",
      "And you re so nice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when you care to be.... Well, go back to them.",
      "It s always so hot and steamy here after the bath.",
      "Chapter 19 Going out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once to the thought, in which there was something not clear.",
      "Instead of going into the drawing-room, where he heard voices, he stopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed up at the sky.",
      "It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there were no clouds.",
      "The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the sky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that quarter.",
      "Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and the Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst.",
      "At each flash of lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished, but as soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places as though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.",
      "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
      "Levin said to himself, feeling beforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul, though he did not know it yet.",
      "Yes, the one unmistakable, incontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and wrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in myself, and in the recognition of which I don t make myself, but whether I will or not I am made one with other men in one body of believers, which is called the church.",
      "Well, but the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists what of them?",
      "he put to himself the question he had feared to face.",
      "Can these hundreds of millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life has no meaning?",
      "He pondered a moment, but immediately corrected himself.",
      "But what am I questioning?",
      "I am questioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of all mankind.",
      "I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all the world with all those misty blurs.",
      "What am I about?",
      "To me individually, to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to express that knowledge in reason and words.",
      "Don t I know that the stars don t move?",
      "he asked himself, gazing at the bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig of the birch-tree.",
      "But looking at the movements of the stars, I can t picture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I m right in saying that the stars move.",
      "And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of the earth?",
      "All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the distances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a stationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has been so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be always alike, and can always be trusted.",
      "And just as the conclusions of the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and a single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and which can always be trusted in my soul.",
      "The question of other religions and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no possibility of deciding.",
      "Oh, you haven t gone in then?",
      "he heard Kitty s voice all at once, as she came by the same way to the drawing-room.",
      "you re not worried about anything?",
      "she said, looking intently at his face in the starlight.",
      "But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not hidden the stars and revealed it.",
      "In that flash she saw his face distinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.",
      "She understands, he thought; she knows what I m thinking about.",
      "Shall I tell her or not?",
      "Yes, I ll tell her.",
      "But at the moment he was about to speak, she began speaking.",
      "do something for me, she said; go into the corner room and see if they ve made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I can t very well.",
      "See if they ve put the new wash stand in it.",
      "Very well, I ll go directly, said Levin, standing up and kissing her.",
      "No, I d better not speak of it, he thought, when she had gone in before him.",
      "It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me, and not to be put into words.",
      "This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child.",
      "There was no surprise in this either.",
      "Faith or not faith I don t know what it is but this feeling has come just as imperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.",
      "I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the coachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of holies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on scolding her for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall still be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall still go on praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it was before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have the power to put into it."

      "CHAPTER I 1801 I have just returned from a visit to my landlord the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with.",
      "This is certainly a beautiful country!",
      "In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.",
      "A perfect misanthropist s Heaven and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us.",
      "A capital fellow!",
      "He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "I said.",
      "A nod was the answer.",
      "Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.",
      "I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir, he interrupted, wincing.",
      "I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it walk in!",
      "The walk in was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, Go to the Deuce!",
      "even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.",
      "When he saw my horse s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court, Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood s horse; and bring up some wine.",
      "Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose, was the reflection suggested by this compound order.",
      "No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.",
      "Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy.",
      "The Lord help us!",
      "he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent.",
      "Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff s dwelling.",
      "Wuthering being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.",
      "Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.",
      "Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.",
      "Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date 1500, and the name Hareton Earnshaw.",
      "I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.",
      "One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here the house pre-eminently.",
      "It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.",
      "One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.",
      "The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.",
      "Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge.",
      "The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.",
      "In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",
      "The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.",
      "Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.",
      "But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.",
      "He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.",
      "Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling to manifestations of mutual kindliness.",
      "He ll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again.",
      "No, I m running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.",
      "Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one.",
      "While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.",
      "I never told my love vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return the sweetest of all imaginable looks.",
      "And what did I do?",
      "I confess it with shame shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.",
      "By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.",
      "I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch.",
      "My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.",
      "You d better let the dog alone, growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison, checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.",
      "She s not accustomed to be spoiled not kept for a pet.",
      "Then, striding to a side door, he shouted again, Joseph!",
      "Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me _vis- -vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.",
      "Not anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees.",
      "I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.",
      "This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.",
      "I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm: I don t think they moved one second faster than usual, though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.",
      "Happily, an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with tucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the scene.",
      "What the devil is the matter?",
      "he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.",
      "What the devil, indeed!",
      "I muttered.",
      "The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.",
      "You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!",
      "They won t meddle with persons who touch nothing, he remarked, putting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.",
      "The dogs do right to be vigilant.",
      "Take a glass of wine?",
      "No, thank you.",
      "Not bitten, are you?",
      "If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.",
      "Heathcliff s countenance relaxed into a grin.",
      "Come, come, he said, you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.",
      "Here, take a little wine.",
      "Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.",
      "Your health, sir?",
      "I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his humour took that turn.",
      "He probably swayed by prudential consideration of the folly of offending a good tenant relaxed a little in the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me, a discourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.",
      "I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.",
      "He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.",
      "I shall go, notwithstanding.",
      "It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared with him.",
      "CHAPTER II Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.",
      "I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights.",
      "On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.",
      "I dine between twelve and one o clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five) on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.",
      "This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles walk, arrived at Heathcliff s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.",
      "On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb.",
      "Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.",
      "Wretched inmates!",
      "I ejaculated, mentally, you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality.",
      "At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time.",
      "I don t care I will get in!",
      "So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.",
      "Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.",
      "What are ye for?",
      "he shouted.",
      "T maister s down i t fowld.",
      "Go round by th end o t laith, if ye went to spake to him.",
      "Is there nobody inside to open the door?",
      "I hallooed, responsively.",
      "There s nobbut t missis; and shoo ll not oppen t an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght.",
      "Why?",
      "Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?",
      "Nor-ne me!",
      "I ll hae no hend wi t, muttered the head, vanishing.",
      "The snow began to drive thickly.",
      "I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind.",
      "He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received.",
      "It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the missis, an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected.",
      "I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat.",
      "She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.",
      "Rough weather!",
      "I remarked.",
      "I m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.",
      "She never opened her mouth.",
      "I stared she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.",
      "Sit down, said the young man, gruffly.",
      "He ll be in soon.",
      "I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.",
      "A beautiful animal!",
      "I commenced again.",
      "Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?",
      "They are not mine, said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.",
      "Ah, your favourites are among these?",
      "I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.",
      "A strange choice of favourites!",
      "she observed scornfully.",
      "Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.",
      "I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.",
      "You should not have come out, she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.",
      "Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance.",
      "She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.",
      "The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.",
      "I don t want your help, she snapped; I can get them for myself.",
      "I beg your pardon!",
      "I hastened to reply.",
      "Were you asked to tea?",
      "she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.",
      "I shall be glad to have a cup, I answered.",
      "Were you asked?",
      "she repeated.",
      "No, I said, half smiling.",
      "You are the proper person to ask me.",
      "She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child s ready to cry.",
      "Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us.",
      "I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.",
      "In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state.",
      "You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!",
      "I exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter during that space.",
      "Half an hour?",
      "he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; I wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.",
      "Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?",
      "People familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.",
      "Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the Grange till morning could you spare me one?",
      "No, I could not.",
      "Oh, indeed!",
      "Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.",
      "Umph!",
      "Are you going to mak the tea?",
      "demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.",
      "Is _he_ to have any?",
      "she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.",
      "Get it ready, will you?",
      "was the answer, uttered so savagely that I started.",
      "The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature.",
      "I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.",
      "When the preparations were finished, he invited me with Now, sir, bring forward your chair.",
      "And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.",
      "I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it.",
      "They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.",
      "It is strange, I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, I ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart My amiable lady!",
      "he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his face.",
      "Where is she my amiable lady?",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.",
      "Well, yes oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone.",
      "Is that it?",
      "Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.",
      "I might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife.",
      "One was about forty: a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years.",
      "The other did not look seventeen.",
      "Then it flashed upon me The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of course.",
      "Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed!",
      "A sad pity I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice.",
      "The last reflection may seem conceited; it was not.",
      "My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law, said Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise.",
      "He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.",
      "Ah, certainly I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy, I remarked, turning to my neighbour.",
      "This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.",
      "But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.",
      "Unhappy in your conjectures, sir, observed my host; we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.",
      "I said she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.",
      "And this young man is Not my son, assuredly.",
      "Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.",
      "My name is Hareton Earnshaw, growled the other; and I d counsel you to respect it!",
      "I ve shown no disrespect, was my reply, laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself.",
      "He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.",
      "I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.",
      "The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.",
      "The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.",
      "A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.",
      "I don t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide, I could not help exclaiming.",
      "The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.",
      "Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.",
      "They ll be covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them, said Heathcliff.",
      "How must I do?",
      "I continued, with rising irritation.",
      "There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its place.",
      "The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i idleness un war, when all on ems goan out!",
      "Bud yah re a nowt, and it s no use talking yah ll niver mend o yer ill ways, but goa raight to t divil, like yer mother afore ye!",
      "I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer.",
      "You scandalous old hypocrite!",
      "she replied.",
      "Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil s name?",
      "I warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I ll ask your abduction as a special favour!",
      "Stop!",
      "look here, Joseph, she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; I ll show you how far I ve progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it.",
      "The red cow didn t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations!",
      "Oh, wicked, wicked!",
      "gasped the elder; may the Lord deliver us from evil!",
      "No, reprobate!",
      "you are a castaway be off, or I ll hurt you seriously!",
      "I ll have you all modelled in wax and clay!",
      "and the first who passes the limits I fix shall I ll not say what he shall be done to but, you ll see!",
      "Go, I m looking at you!",
      "The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and ejaculating wicked as he went.",
      "I thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, I said earnestly, you must excuse me for troubling you.",
      "I presume, because, with that face, I m sure you cannot help being good-hearted.",
      "Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to London!",
      "Take the road you came, she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before her.",
      "It is brief advice, but as sound as I can give.",
      "Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow, your conscience won t whisper that it is partly your fault?",
      "How so?",
      "I cannot escort you.",
      "They wouldn t let me go to the end of the garden wall.",
      "_You_!",
      "I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night, I cried.",
      "I want you to _tell_ me my way, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.",
      "Who?",
      "There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.",
      "Which would you have?",
      "Are there no boys at the farm?",
      "No; those are all.",
      "Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.",
      "That you may settle with your host.",
      "I have nothing to do with it.",
      "I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills, cried Heathcliff s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.",
      "As to staying here, I don t keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.",
      "I can sleep on a chair in this room, I replied.",
      "No, no!",
      "A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!",
      "said the unmannerly wretch.",
      "With this insult my patience was at an end.",
      "I uttered an expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in my haste.",
      "It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other.",
      "At first the young man appeared about to befriend me.",
      "I ll go with him as far as the park, he said.",
      "You ll go with him to hell!",
      "exclaimed his master, or whatever relation he bore.",
      "And who is to look after the horses, eh?",
      "A man s life is of more consequence than one evening s neglect of the horses: somebody must go, murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected.",
      "Not at your command!",
      "retorted Hareton.",
      "If you set store on him, you d better be quiet.",
      "Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin, she answered, sharply.",
      "Hearken, hearken, shoo s cursing on em!",
      "muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been steering.",
      "He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.",
      "Maister, maister, he s staling t lanthern!",
      "shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat.",
      "Hey, Gnasher!",
      "Hey, dog!",
      "Hey Wolf, holld him, holld him!",
      "On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.",
      "Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out on their peril to keep me one minute longer with several incoherent threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.",
      "The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.",
      "I don t know what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer.",
      "This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.",
      "She thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.",
      "Well, Mr. Earnshaw, she cried, I wonder what you ll have agait next?",
      "Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones?",
      "I see this house will never do for me look at t poor lad, he s fair choking!",
      "Wisht, wisht; you mun n t go on so.",
      "Come in, and I ll cure that: there now, hold ye still.",
      "With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.",
      "I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof.",
      "He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.",
      "CHAPTER III While leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the candle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.",
      "I asked the reason.",
      "She did not know, she answered: she had only lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not begin to be curious.",
      "Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed.",
      "The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows.",
      "Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself.",
      "In fact, it formed a little closet, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.",
      "I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.",
      "The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.",
      "This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters, large and small _Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.",
      "In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw Heathcliff Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.",
      "I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.",
      "It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw, her book, and a date some quarter of a century back.",
      "I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.",
      "Catherine s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary at least the appearance of one covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left.",
      "Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand.",
      "At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend Joseph, rudely, yet powerfully sketched.",
      "An immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.",
      "An awful Sunday, commenced the paragraph beneath.",
      "I wish my father were back again.",
      "Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to Heathcliff is atrocious H. and I are going to rebel we took our initiatory step this evening.",
      "All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire doing anything but reading their Bibles, I ll answer for it Heathcliff, myself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake.",
      "A vain idea!",
      "The service lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us descending, What, done already?",
      "On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.",
      "You forget you have a master here, says the tyrant.",
      "I ll demolish the first who puts me out of temper!",
      "I insist on perfect sobriety and silence.",
      "Oh, boy!",
      "was that you?",
      "Frances darling, pull his hair as you go by: I heard him snap his fingers.",
      "Frances pulled his hair heartily, and then went and seated herself on her husband s knee, and there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.",
      "We made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser.",
      "I had just fastened our pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph, on an errand from the stables.",
      "He tears down my handiwork, boxes my ears, and croaks: T maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o ered, und t sound o t gospel still i yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!",
      "Shame on ye!",
      "sit ye down, ill childer!",
      "there s good books eneugh if ye ll read em: sit ye down, and think o yer sowls!",
      "Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber he thrust upon us.",
      "I could not bear the employment.",
      "I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I hated a good book.",
      "Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.",
      "Then there was a hubbub!",
      "Maister Hindley!",
      "shouted our chaplain.",
      "Maister, coom hither!",
      "Miss Cathy s riven th back off Th Helmet o Salvation, un Heathcliff s pawsed his fit into t first part o T Brooad Way to Destruction!",
      "It s fair flaysome that ye let em go on this gait.",
      "Ech!",
      "th owd man wad ha laced em properly but he s goan!",
      "Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the back-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, owd Nick would fetch us as sure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate nook to await his advent.",
      "I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a shelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is impatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman s cloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter.",
      "A pleasant suggestion and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his prophecy verified we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we are here.",
      "* * * * * * I suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up another subject: she waxed lachrymose.",
      "How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!",
      "she wrote.",
      "My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I can t give over.",
      "Poor Heathcliff!",
      "Hindley calls him a vagabond, and won t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he and I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders.",
      "He has been blaming our father (how dared he?)",
      "for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right place * * * * * * I began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from manuscript to print.",
      "I saw a red ornamented title Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the Seventy-First.",
      "A Pious Discourse delivered by the Reverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.",
      "And while I was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep.",
      "Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper!",
      "What else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night?",
      "I don t remember another that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.",
      "I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.",
      "I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for a guide.",
      "The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a pilgrim s staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood to be so denominated.",
      "For a moment I considered it absurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.",
      "Then a new idea flashed across me.",
      "I was not going there: we were journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text Seventy Times Seven; and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the First of the Seventy-First, and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.",
      "We came to the chapel.",
      "I have passed it really in my walks, twice or thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there.",
      "The roof has been kept whole hitherto; but as the clergyman s stipend is only twenty pounds per annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.",
      "However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached good God!",
      "what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin!",
      "Where he searched for them, I cannot tell.",
      "He had his private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion.",
      "They were of the most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.",
      "Oh, how weary I grew.",
      "How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and revived!",
      "How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_ have done.",
      "I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the _First of the Seventy-First_.",
      "At that crisis, a sudden inspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.",
      "Sir, I exclaimed, sitting here within these four walls, at one stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse.",
      "Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and been about to depart Seventy times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat.",
      "The four hundred and ninety-first is too much.",
      "Fellow-martyrs, have at him!",
      "Drag him down, and crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!",
      "_Thou art the Man!_ cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his cushion.",
      "Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy visage seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul Lo, this is human weakness: this also may be absolved!",
      "The First of the Seventy-First is come.",
      "Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.",
      "Such honour have all His saints!",
      "With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim s staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most ferocious assailant, for his.",
      "In the confluence of the multitude, several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.",
      "Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings: every man s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me.",
      "And what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult?",
      "What had played Jabez s part in the row?",
      "Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes!",
      "I listened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than before.",
      "This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also, the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.",
      "The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when awake, but forgotten.",
      "I must stop it, nevertheless!",
      "I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!",
      "The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed, Let me in let me in!",
      "Who are you?",
      "I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.",
      "Catherine Linton, it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of _Linton_?",
      "I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton) I m come home: I d lost my way on the moor!",
      "As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child s face looking through the window.",
      "Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, Let me in!",
      "and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening me with fear.",
      "How can I!",
      "I said at length.",
      "Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!",
      "The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.",
      "I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!",
      "Begone!",
      "I shouted.",
      "I ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.",
      "It is twenty years, mourned the voice: twenty years.",
      "I ve been a waif for twenty years!",
      "Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward.",
      "I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.",
      "To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.",
      "I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.",
      "At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, Is any one here?",
      "I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff s accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.",
      "With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.",
      "I shall not soon forget the effect my action produced.",
      "Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him.",
      "The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.",
      "It is only your guest, sir, I called out, desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further.",
      "I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.",
      "I m sorry I disturbed you.",
      "Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!",
      "I wish you were at the commenced my host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to hold it steady.",
      "And who showed you up into this room?",
      "he continued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions.",
      "Who was it?",
      "I ve a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment!",
      "It was your servant Zillah, I replied, flinging myself on to the floor, and rapidly resuming my garments.",
      "I should not care if you did, Mr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it.",
      "I suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense.",
      "Well, it is swarming with ghosts and goblins!",
      "You have reason in shutting it up, I assure you.",
      "No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!",
      "What do you mean?",
      "asked Heathcliff, and what are you doing?",
      "Lie down and finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven s sake!",
      "don t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were having your throat cut!",
      "If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have strangled me!",
      "I returned.",
      "I m not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again.",
      "Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham akin to you on the mother s side?",
      "And that minx, Catherine Linton, or Earnshaw, or however she was called she must have been a changeling wicked little soul!",
      "She told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal transgressions, I ve no doubt!",
      "Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of Heathcliff s with Catherine s name in the book, which had completely slipped from my memory, till thus awakened.",
      "I blushed at my inconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the offence, I hastened to add The truth is, sir, I passed the first part of the night in Here I stopped afresh I was about to say perusing those old volumes, then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I went on in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.",
      "A monotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_ thundered Heathcliff with savage vehemence.",
      "How how _dare_ you, under my roof?",
      "God!",
      "he s mad to speak so!",
      "And he struck his forehead with rage.",
      "I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of Catherine Linton before, but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.",
      "Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.",
      "I guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.",
      "Not liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the night: Not three o clock yet!",
      "I could have taken oath it had been six.",
      "Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!",
      "Always at nine in winter, and rise at four, said my host, suppressing a groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm s shadow, dashing a tear from his eyes.",
      "Mr. Lockwood, he added, you may go into my room: you ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.",
      "And for me, too, I replied.",
      "I ll walk in the yard till daylight, and then I ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.",
      "I m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or town.",
      "A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.",
      "Delightful company!",
      "muttered Heathcliff.",
      "Take the candle, and go where you please.",
      "I shall join you directly.",
      "Keep out of the yard, though, the dogs are unchained; and the house Juno mounts sentinel there, and nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages.",
      "But, away with you!",
      "I ll come in two minutes!",
      "I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent sense.",
      "He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.",
      "Come in!",
      "he sobbed.",
      "Cathy, do come.",
      "Oh, do _once_ more!",
      "Oh!",
      "my heart s darling!",
      "hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!",
      "The spectre showed a spectre s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the light.",
      "There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my comprehension.",
      "I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together, enabled me to rekindle my candle.",
      "Nothing was stirring except a brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a querulous mew.",
      "Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other.",
      "We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.",
      "He cast a sinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco.",
      "My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and puffed away.",
      "I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.",
      "A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a good-morning, but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for Hareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of curses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.",
      "He glanced over the back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.",
      "I guessed, by his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch, made a movement to follow him.",
      "He noticed this, and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.",
      "It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs. Heathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the blaze.",
      "She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her eyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog, now and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.",
      "I was surprised to see Heathcliff there also.",
      "He stood by the fire, his back towards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and heave an indignant groan.",
      "And you, you worthless he broke out as I entered, turning to his daughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep, but generally represented by a dash .",
      "There you are, at your idle tricks again!",
      "The rest of them do earn their bread you live on my charity!",
      "Put your trash away, and find something to do.",
      "You shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my sight do you hear, damnable jade?",
      "I ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse, answered the young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair.",
      "But I ll not do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I please!",
      "Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance, obviously acquainted with its weight.",
      "Having no desire to be entertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute.",
      "Each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay.",
      "That was not long.",
      "I declined joining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable ice.",
      "My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the garden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.",
      "It was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday s walk left pictured in my mind.",
      "I had remarked on one side of the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.",
      "We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of Thrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there.",
      "Our adieux were limited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own resources; for the porter s lodge is untenanted as yet.",
      "The distance from the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate.",
      "At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.",
      "My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming, tumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains.",
      "I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs; whence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.",
      "CHAPTER IV What vain weather-cocks we are!",
      "I, who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at length, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable I, weak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.",
      "You have lived here a considerable time, I commenced; did you not say sixteen years?",
      "Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her; after she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.",
      "Indeed.",
      "There ensued a pause.",
      "She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her own affairs, and those could hardly interest me.",
      "However, having studied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated Ah, times are greatly changed since then!",
      "Yes, I remarked, you ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?",
      "I have: and troubles too, she said.",
      "Oh, I ll turn the talk on my landlord s family!",
      "I thought to myself.",
      "A good subject to start!",
      "And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for kin.",
      "With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let Thrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior.",
      "Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?",
      "I inquired.",
      "Rich, sir!",
      "she returned.",
      "He has nobody knows what money, and every year it increases.",
      "Yes, yes, he s rich enough to live in a finer house than this: but he s very near close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.",
      "It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!",
      "He had a son, it seems?",
      "Yes, he had one he is dead.",
      "And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?",
      "Yes.",
      "Where did she come from originally?",
      "Why, sir, she is my late master s daughter: Catherine Linton was her maiden name.",
      "I nursed her, poor thing!",
      "I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would remove here, and then we might have been together again.",
      "What!",
      "Catherine Linton?",
      "I exclaimed, astonished.",
      "But a minute s reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine.",
      "Then, I continued, my predecessor s name was Linton?",
      "It was.",
      "And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "Are they relations?",
      "No; he is the late Mrs. Linton s nephew.",
      "The young lady s cousin, then?",
      "Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother s, the other on the father s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton s sister.",
      "I see the house at Wuthering Heights has Earnshaw carved over the front door.",
      "Are they an old family?",
      "Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of us I mean, of the Lintons.",
      "Have you been to Wuthering Heights?",
      "I beg pardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff?",
      "she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think, not very happy.",
      "Oh dear, I don t wonder!",
      "And how did you like the master?",
      "A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.",
      "Is not that his character?",
      "Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!",
      "The less you meddle with him the better.",
      "He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.",
      "Do you know anything of his history?",
      "It s a cuckoo s, sir I know all about it: except where he was born, and who were his parents, and how he got his money at first.",
      "And Hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock!",
      "The unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.",
      "Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.",
      "Oh, certainly, sir!",
      "I ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I ll sit as long as you please.",
      "But you ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and you must have some gruel to drive it out.",
      "The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head felt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.",
      "This caused me to feel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious effects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday.",
      "She returned presently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having placed the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find me so companionable.",
      "* * * * * Before I came to live here, she commenced waiting no farther invitation to her story I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton s father, and I got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to.",
      "One fine summer morning it was the beginning of harvest, I remember Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs, dressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me for I sat eating my porridge with them and he said, speaking to his son, Now, my bonny man, I m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?",
      "You may choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!",
      "Hindley named a fiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.",
      "He did not forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes.",
      "He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.",
      "It seemed a long while to us all the three days of his absence and often did little Cathy ask when he would be home.",
      "Mrs. Earnshaw expected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look.",
      "Then it grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o clock, the door-latch was raised quietly, and in stepped the master.",
      "He threw himself into a chair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly killed he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.",
      "And at the end of it to be flighted to death!",
      "he said, opening his great-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms.",
      "See here, wife!",
      "I was never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e en take it as a gift of God; though it s as dark almost as if it came from the devil.",
      "We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy s head I had a peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its face looked older than Catherine s; yet when it was set on its feet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand.",
      "I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for?",
      "What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?",
      "The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.",
      "Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it.",
      "Well, the conclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.",
      "Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored: then, both began searching their father s pockets for the presents he had promised them.",
      "The former was a boy of fourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners.",
      "They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow.",
      "By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw s door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber.",
      "Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.",
      "This was Heathcliff s first introduction to the family.",
      "On coming back a few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I found they had christened him Heathcliff : it was the name of a son who died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian and surname.",
      "Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with him shamefully: for I wasn t reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.",
      "He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment: he would stand Hindley s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.",
      "This endurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him.",
      "He took to Heathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.",
      "So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at Mrs. Earnshaw s death, which happened in less than two years after, the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent s affections and his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.",
      "I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed my idea.",
      "Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn t wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.",
      "However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over.",
      "The difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial.",
      "Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.",
      "He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me, and praised me for my care.",
      "I was vain of his commendations, and softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley lost his last ally: still I couldn t dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.",
      "He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.",
      "As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.",
      "Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley You must exchange horses with me: I don t like mine; and if you won t I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you ve given me this week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.",
      "Hindley put out his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.",
      "You d better do it at once, he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you ll get them again with interest.",
      "Off, dog!",
      "cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay.",
      "Throw it, he replied, standing still, and then I ll tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly.",
      "Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused it.",
      "Take my colt, Gipsy, then!",
      "said young Earnshaw.",
      "And I pray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper!",
      "and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what you are, imp of Satan.",
      "And take that, I hope he ll kick out your brains!",
      "Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.",
      "I was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house.",
      "I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted.",
      "He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear.",
      "CHAPTER V In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.",
      "He had been active and healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable.",
      "A nothing vexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits.",
      "This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-turn.",
      "It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child s pride and black tempers.",
      "Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that he could not do it.",
      "At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land himself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr. Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said Hindley was nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.",
      "I hoped heartily we should have peace now.",
      "It hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.",
      "I fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking frame.",
      "We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two people Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up yonder.",
      "He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours.",
      "By his knack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he gained.",
      "He was relentless in worrying him about his soul s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly.",
      "He encouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw s weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.",
      "Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed, we had not a minute s security that she wouldn t be in mischief.",
      "Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.",
      "A wild, wicked slip she was but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her.",
      "She was much too fond of Heathcliff.",
      "The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us on his account.",
      "In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.",
      "Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime.",
      "His peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look, and her ready words; turning Joseph s religious curses into ridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most showing how her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.",
      "After behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night.",
      "Nay, Cathy, the old man would say, I cannot love thee, thou rt worse than thy brother.",
      "Go, say thy prayers, child, and ask God s pardon.",
      "I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared thee!",
      "That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.",
      "But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw s troubles on earth.",
      "He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the fire-side.",
      "A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all together I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat in the house then, after their work was done).",
      "Miss Cathy had been sick, and that made her still; she leant against her father s knee, and Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.",
      "I remember the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her gentle and saying, Why canst thou not always be a good lass, Cathy?",
      "And she turned her face up to his, and laughed, and answered, Why cannot you always be a good man, father?",
      "But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she would sing him to sleep.",
      "She began singing very low, till his fingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.",
      "Then I told her to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.",
      "We all kept as mute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed.",
      "He stepped forward, and called him by name, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle and looked at him.",
      "I thought there was something wrong as he set down the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to frame upstairs, and make little din they might pray alone that evening he had summut to do.",
      "I shall bid father good-night first, said Catherine, putting her arms round his neck, before we could hinder her.",
      "The poor thing discovered her loss directly she screamed out Oh, he s dead, Heathcliff!",
      "he s dead!",
      "And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.",
      "I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.",
      "He told me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.",
      "I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.",
      "However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me; the other said he would come in the morning.",
      "Leaving Joseph to explain matters, I ran to the children s room: their door was ajar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer, and did not need me to console them.",
      "The little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing we were all there safe together.",
      "CHAPTER VI Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and a thing that amazed us, and set the neighbours gossiping right and left he brought a wife with him.",
      "What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father.",
      "She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account.",
      "Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold, appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the mourners.",
      "I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly Are they gone yet?",
      "Then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn t know; but she felt so afraid of dying!",
      "I imagined her as little likely to die as myself.",
      "She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds.",
      "I did remark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her.",
      "We don t in general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to us first.",
      "Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence.",
      "He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave the house for him.",
      "Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.",
      "She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.",
      "Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish, Hindley became tyrannical.",
      "A few words from her, evincing a dislike to Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.",
      "He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm.",
      "Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields.",
      "They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they kept clear of him.",
      "He would not even have seen after their going to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.",
      "But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at.",
      "The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge; and many a time I ve cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures.",
      "One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.",
      "We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore nobody should let them in that night.",
      "The household went to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition, should they return.",
      "In a while, I distinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate.",
      "I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.",
      "There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.",
      "Where is Miss Catherine?",
      "I cried hurriedly.",
      "No accident, I hope?",
      "At Thrushcross Grange, he answered; and I would have been there too, but they had not the manners to ask me to stay.",
      "Well, you will catch it!",
      "I said: you ll never be content till you re sent about your business.",
      "What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?",
      "Let me get off my wet clothes, and I ll tell you all about it, Nelly, he replied.",
      "I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued Cathy and I escaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire.",
      "Do you think they do?",
      "Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their man-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they don t answer properly?",
      "Probably not, I responded.",
      "They are good children, no doubt, and don t deserve the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.",
      "Don t cant, Nelly, he said: nonsense!",
      "We ran from the top of the Heights to the park, without stopping Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot.",
      "You ll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.",
      "We crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window.",
      "The light came from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half closed.",
      "Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw ah!",
      "it was beautiful a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft tapers.",
      "Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves.",
      "Shouldn t they have been happy?",
      "We should have thought ourselves in heaven!",
      "And now, guess what your good children were doing?",
      "Isabella I believe she is eleven, a year younger than Cathy lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her.",
      "Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.",
      "The idiots!",
      "That was their pleasure!",
      "to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it, refused to take it.",
      "We laughed outright at the petted things; we did despise them!",
      "When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted?",
      "or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room?",
      "I d not exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton s at Thrushcross Grange not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley s blood!",
      "Hush, hush!",
      "I interrupted.",
      "Still you have not told me, Heathcliff, how Catherine is left behind?",
      "I told you we laughed, he answered.",
      "The Lintons heard us, and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and then a cry, Oh, mamma, mamma!",
      "Oh, papa!",
      "Oh, mamma, come here.",
      "Oh, papa, oh!",
      "They really did howl out something in that way.",
      "We made frightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee.",
      "I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell down.",
      "Run, Heathcliff, run!",
      "she whispered.",
      "They have let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!",
      "The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting.",
      "She did not yell out no!",
      "she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow.",
      "I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat.",
      "A beast of a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!",
      "He changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker s game.",
      "The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver.",
      "The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I m certain, but from pain.",
      "He carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance.",
      "What prey, Robert?",
      "hallooed Linton from the entrance.",
      "Skulker has caught a little girl, sir, he replied; and there s a lad here, he added, making a clutch at me, who looks an out-and-outer!",
      "Very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.",
      "Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you!",
      "you shall go to the gallows for this.",
      "Mr. Linton, sir, don t lay by your gun.",
      "No, no, Robert, said the old fool.",
      "The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me cleverly.",
      "Come in; I ll furnish them a reception.",
      "There, John, fasten the chain.",
      "Give Skulker some water, Jenny.",
      "To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!",
      "Where will their insolence stop?",
      "Oh, my dear Mary, look here!",
      "Don t be afraid, it is but a boy yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as well as features?",
      "He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror.",
      "The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping Frightful thing!",
      "Put him in the cellar, papa.",
      "He s exactly like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.",
      "Isn t he, Edgar?",
      "While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and laughed.",
      "Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient wit to recognise her.",
      "They see us at church, you know, though we seldom meet them elsewhere.",
      "That s Miss Earnshaw!",
      "he whispered to his mother, and look how Skulker has bitten her how her foot bleeds!",
      "Miss Earnshaw?",
      "Nonsense!",
      "cried the dame; Miss Earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy!",
      "And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning surely it is and she may be lamed for life!",
      "What culpable carelessness in her brother!",
      "exclaimed Mr. Linton, turning from me to Catherine.",
      "I ve understood from Shielders (that was the curate, sir) that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.",
      "But who is this?",
      "Where did she pick up this companion?",
      "Oho!",
      "I declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to Liverpool a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.",
      "A wicked boy, at all events, remarked the old lady, and quite unfit for a decent house!",
      "Did you notice his language, Linton?",
      "I m shocked that my children should have heard it.",
      "I recommenced cursing don t be angry, Nelly and so Robert was ordered to take me off.",
      "I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly, secured the door again.",
      "The curtains were still looped up at one corner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments, unless they let her out.",
      "She sat on the sofa quietly.",
      "Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine.",
      "Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping at a distance.",
      "Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons a dim reflection from her own enchanting face.",
      "I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them to everybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?",
      "There will more come of this business than you reckon on, I answered, covering him up and extinguishing the light.",
      "You are incurable, Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if he won t. My words came truer than I desired.",
      "The luckless adventure made Earnshaw furious.",
      "And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in earnest.",
      "Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found it impossible.",
      "CHAPTER VII Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.",
      "By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.",
      "The mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in.",
      "Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!",
      "I should scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now.",
      "Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?",
      "Isabella has not her natural advantages, replied his wife: but she must mind and not grow wild again here.",
      "Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls let me untie your hat.",
      "I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.",
      "She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.",
      "Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.",
      "If he were careless, and uncared for, before Catherine s absence, he had been ten times more so since.",
      "Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water.",
      "Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had seen three months service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded.",
      "He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected.",
      "Is Heathcliff not here?",
      "she demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.",
      "Heathcliff, you may come forward, cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself.",
      "You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like the other servants.",
      "Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, Why, how very black and cross you look!",
      "and how how funny and grim!",
      "But that s because I m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.",
      "Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?",
      "She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.",
      "Shake hands, Heathcliff, said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; once in a way, that is permitted.",
      "I shall not, replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; I shall not stand to be laughed at.",
      "I shall not bear it!",
      "And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.",
      "I did not mean to laugh at you, she said; I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at least!",
      "What are you sulky for?",
      "It was only that you looked odd.",
      "If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will be all right: but you are so dirty!",
      "She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his.",
      "You needn t have touched me!",
      "he answered, following her eye and snatching away his hand.",
      "I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty.",
      "With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper.",
      "After playing lady s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph s affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.",
      "He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging Missy s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.",
      "They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy.",
      "Under these circumstances I remained solitary.",
      "I smelt the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular care the scoured and well-swept floor.",
      "I gave due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad s situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to crying.",
      "It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him.",
      "He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.",
      "Make haste, Heathcliff!",
      "I said, the kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.",
      "He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.",
      "Come are you coming?",
      "I continued.",
      "There s a little cake for each of you, nearly enough; and you ll need half-an-hour s donning.",
      "I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.",
      "Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.",
      "His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.",
      "He managed to continue work till nine o clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber.",
      "Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back.",
      "In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for church.",
      "Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.",
      "He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly Nelly, make me decent, I m going to be good.",
      "High time, Heathcliff, I said; you _have_ grieved Catherine: she s sorry she ever came home, I daresay!",
      "It looks as if you envied her, because she is more thought of than you.",
      "The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.",
      "Did she say she was grieved?",
      "he inquired, looking very serious.",
      "She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.",
      "Well, _I_ cried last night, he returned, and I had more reason to cry than she.",
      "Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach, said I.",
      "Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.",
      "But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in.",
      "You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress.",
      "And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does.",
      "You are younger, and yet, I ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don t you feel that you could?",
      "Heathcliff s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed.",
      "But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn t make him less handsome or me more so.",
      "I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!",
      "And cried for mamma at every turn, I added, and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of rain.",
      "Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!",
      "Come to the glass, and I ll let you see what you should wish.",
      "Do you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil s spies?",
      "Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes.",
      "Don t get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.",
      "In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton s great blue eyes and even forehead, he replied.",
      "I do and that won t help me to them.",
      "A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad, I continued, if you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly.",
      "And now that we ve done washing, and combing, and sulking tell me whether you don t think yourself rather handsome?",
      "I ll tell you, I do.",
      "You re fit for a prince in disguise.",
      "Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week s income, Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange together?",
      "And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England.",
      "Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!",
      "So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.",
      "He ran to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in winter.",
      "Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces.",
      "I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.",
      "They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph keep the fellow out of the room send him into the garret till dinner is over.",
      "He ll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them a minute.",
      "Nay, sir, I could not avoid answering, he ll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.",
      "He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till dark, cried Hindley.",
      "Begone, you vagabond!",
      "you are attempting the coxcomb, are you?",
      "Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks see if I won t pull them a bit longer!",
      "They are long enough already, observed Master Linton, peeping from the doorway; I wonder they don t make his head ache.",
      "It s like a colt s mane over his eyes!",
      "He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.",
      "He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under his gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker s face and neck; who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the place.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.",
      "I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling.",
      "His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.",
      "You should not have spoken to him!",
      "she expostulated with Master Linton.",
      "He was in a bad temper, and now you ve spoilt your visit; and he ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged!",
      "I can t eat my dinner.",
      "Why did you speak to him, Edgar?",
      "I didn t, sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.",
      "I promised mamma that I wouldn t say one word to him, and I didn t. Well, don t cry, replied Catherine, contemptuously; you re not killed.",
      "Don t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!",
      "Hush, Isabella!",
      "Has anybody hurt _you?_ There, there, children to your seats!",
      "cried Hindley, bustling in.",
      "That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.",
      "Next time, Master Edgar, take the law into your own fists it will give you an appetite!",
      "The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.",
      "They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them merry with lively talk.",
      "I waited behind her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.",
      "An unfeeling child, I thought to myself; how lightly she dismisses her old playmate s troubles.",
      "I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.",
      "She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them.",
      "She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.",
      "I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals.",
      "In the evening we had a dance.",
      "Cathy begged that he might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the deficiency.",
      "We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.",
      "They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them.",
      "After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees.",
      "Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.",
      "Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed.",
      "They shut the house door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people.",
      "She made no stay at the stairs -head, but mounted farther, to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called him.",
      "He stubbornly declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards.",
      "I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn her.",
      "Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within.",
      "The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again.",
      "When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour s, to be removed from the sound of our devil s psalmody, as it pleased him to call it.",
      "I told them I intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday s dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. Hindley that once.",
      "He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away.",
      "He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and remained rapt in dumb meditation.",
      "On my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered gravely I m trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back.",
      "I don t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last.",
      "I hope he will not die before I do!",
      "For shame, Heathcliff!",
      "said I.",
      "It is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to forgive.",
      "No, God won t have the satisfaction that I shall, he returned.",
      "I only wish I knew the best way!",
      "Let me alone, and I ll plan it out: while I m thinking of that I don t feel pain.",
      "But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.",
      "I m annoyed how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for bed!",
      "I could have told Heathcliff s history, all that you need hear, in half a dozen words.",
      "* * * * * Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I was very far from nodding.",
      "Sit still, Mrs. Dean, I cried; do sit still another half-hour.",
      "You ve done just right to tell the story leisurely.",
      "That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same style.",
      "I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or less.",
      "The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.",
      "No matter I m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.",
      "One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.",
      "You shouldn t lie till ten.",
      "There s the very prime of the morning gone long before that time.",
      "A person who has not done one-half his day s work by ten o clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.",
      "Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon.",
      "I prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.",
      "I hope not, sir.",
      "Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw No, no, I ll allow nothing of the sort!",
      "Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?",
      "A terribly lazy mood, I should say.",
      "On the contrary, a tiresomely active one.",
      "It is mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely.",
      "I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker-on.",
      "They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external things.",
      "I could fancy a love for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year s standing.",
      "One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.",
      "here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us, observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.",
      "Excuse me, I responded; you, my good friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion.",
      "Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class.",
      "I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think.",
      "You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.",
      "Mrs. Dean laughed.",
      "I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body, she said; not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year s end to year s end; but I have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.",
      "You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor man s daughter.",
      "However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next summer the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three years ago.",
      "CHAPTER VIII On the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.",
      "We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she ran.",
      "Oh, such a grand bairn!",
      "she panted out.",
      "The finest lad that ever breathed!",
      "But the doctor says missis must go: he says she s been in a consumption these many months.",
      "I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she has nothing to keep her, and she ll be dead before winter.",
      "You must come home directly.",
      "You re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it day and night.",
      "I wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!",
      "But is she very ill?",
      "I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet.",
      "I guess she is; yet she looks bravely, replied the girl, and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.",
      "She s out of her head for joy, it s such a beauty!",
      "If I were her I m certain I should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth.",
      "I was fairly mad at him.",
      "Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward, and says he Earnshaw, it s a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son.",
      "When she came, I felt convinced we shouldn t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will probably finish her.",
      "Don t take on, and fret about it too much: it can t be helped.",
      "And besides, you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass!",
      "And what did the master answer?",
      "I think he swore: but I didn t mind him, I was straining to see the bairn, and she began again to describe it rapturously.",
      "I, as zealous as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for Hindley s sake.",
      "He had room in his heart only for two idols his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn t conceive how he would bear the loss.",
      "When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and, as I passed in, I asked, how was the baby?",
      "Nearly ready to run about, Nell!",
      "he replied, putting on a cheerful smile.",
      "And the mistress?",
      "I ventured to inquire; the doctor says she s Damn the doctor!",
      "he interrupted, reddening.",
      "Frances is quite right: she ll be perfectly well by this time next week.",
      "Are you going upstairs?",
      "will you tell her that I ll come, if she ll promise not to talk.",
      "I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she must tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.",
      "I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits, and replied merrily, I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying.",
      "Well, say I promise I won t speak: but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!",
      "Poor soul!",
      "Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her health improved every day.",
      "When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn t put him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, I know you need not she s well she does not want any more attendance from you!",
      "She never was in a consumption.",
      "It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.",
      "He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her a very slight one he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face changed, and she was dead.",
      "As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded him.",
      "For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.",
      "He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation.",
      "The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.",
      "I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would.",
      "Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.",
      "The master s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and Heathcliff.",
      "His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint.",
      "And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_ possessed of something diabolical at that period.",
      "He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.",
      "I could not half tell what an infernal house we had.",
      "The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton s visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception.",
      "At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!",
      "I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me, though.",
      "She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.",
      "He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.",
      "It used to hang on one side, and his wife s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what she was.",
      "Can you make that out?",
      "Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in expression.",
      "It formed a sweet picture.",
      "The long light hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too graceful.",
      "I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual.",
      "I marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw.",
      "A very agreeable portrait, I observed to the house-keeper.",
      "Is it like?",
      "Yes, she answered; but he looked better when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.",
      "Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five-weeks residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one.",
      "In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian, and worse than a brute, she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.",
      "Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.",
      "He had a terror of Earnshaw s reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious, kept out of the way.",
      "I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.",
      "I ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery.",
      "That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened into more humility.",
      "She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser.",
      "Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it.",
      "He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.",
      "In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books or learning.",
      "His childhood s sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.",
      "He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former level.",
      "Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.",
      "Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him.",
      "On the before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.",
      "Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?",
      "asked Heathcliff.",
      "Are you going anywhere?",
      "No, it is raining, she answered.",
      "Why have you that silk frock on, then?",
      "he said.",
      "Nobody coming here, I hope?",
      "Not that I know of, stammered Miss: but you should be in the field now, Heathcliff.",
      "It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were gone.",
      "Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence, observed the boy.",
      "I ll not work any more to-day: I ll stay with you.",
      "Oh, but Joseph will tell, she suggested; you d better go!",
      "Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will take him till dark, and he ll never know.",
      "So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.",
      "Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion.",
      "Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon, she said, at the conclusion of a minute s silence.",
      "As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for no good.",
      "Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy, he persisted; don t turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!",
      "I m on the point, sometimes, of complaining that they but I ll not That they what?",
      "cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled countenance.",
      "Oh, Nelly!",
      "she added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, you ve combed my hair quite out of curl!",
      "That s enough; let me alone.",
      "What are you on the point of complaining about, Heathcliff?",
      "Nothing only look at the almanack on that wall; he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, The crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with me.",
      "Do you see?",
      "I ve marked every day.",
      "Yes very foolish: as if I took notice!",
      "replied Catherine, in a peevish tone.",
      "And where is the sense of that?",
      "To show that I _do_ take notice, said Heathcliff.",
      "And should I always be sitting with you?",
      "she demanded, growing more irritated.",
      "What good do I get?",
      "What do you talk about?",
      "You might be dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, either!",
      "You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my company, Cathy!",
      "exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.",
      "It s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing, she muttered.",
      "Her companion rose up, but he hadn t time to express his feelings further, for a horse s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received.",
      "Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.",
      "The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect.",
      "He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do: that s less gruff than we talk here, and softer.",
      "I m not come too soon, am I?",
      "he said, casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.",
      "No, answered Catherine.",
      "What are you doing there, Nelly?",
      "My work, Miss, I replied.",
      "(Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)",
      "She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, Take yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don t commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!",
      "It s a good opportunity, now that master is away, I answered aloud: he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.",
      "I m sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.",
      "I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence, exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.",
      "I m sorry for it, Miss Catherine, was my response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation.",
      "She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm.",
      "I ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, Oh, Miss, that s a nasty trick!",
      "You have no right to nip me, and I m not going to bear it.",
      "I didn t touch you, you lying creature!",
      "cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.",
      "She never had power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.",
      "What s that, then?",
      "I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her.",
      "She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water.",
      "Catherine, love!",
      "Catherine!",
      "interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.",
      "Leave the room, Ellen!",
      "she repeated, trembling all over.",
      "Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt Cathy, which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him.",
      "In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.",
      "He drew back in consternation.",
      "I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement.",
      "The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.",
      "That s right!",
      "I said to myself.",
      "Take warning and begone!",
      "It s a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.",
      "Where are you going?",
      "demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.",
      "He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.",
      "You must not go!",
      "she exclaimed, energetically.",
      "I must and shall!",
      "he replied in a subdued voice.",
      "No, she persisted, grasping the handle; not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in that temper.",
      "I should be miserable all night, and I won t be miserable for you!",
      "Can I stay after you have struck me?",
      "asked Linton.",
      "Catherine was mute.",
      "You ve made me afraid and ashamed of you, he continued; I ll not come here again!",
      "Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.",
      "And you told a deliberate untruth!",
      "I didn t!",
      "she cried, recovering her speech; I did nothing deliberately.",
      "Well, go, if you please get away!",
      "And now I ll cry I ll cry myself sick!",
      "She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious earnest.",
      "Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there he lingered.",
      "I resolved to encourage him.",
      "Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir, I called out.",
      "As bad as any marred child: you d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve us.",
      "The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten.",
      "Ah, I thought, there will be no saving him: he s doomed, and flies to his fate!",
      "And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess themselves lovers.",
      "Intelligence of Mr. Hindley s arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber.",
      "I went to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the master s fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.",
      "CHAPTER IX He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.",
      "Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast s fondness or his madman s rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.",
      "There, I ve found it out at last!",
      "cried Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a dog.",
      "By heaven and hell, you ve sworn between you to murder that child!",
      "I know how it is, now, that he is always out of my way.",
      "But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly!",
      "You needn t laugh; for I ve just crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!",
      "But I don t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley, I answered; it has been cutting red herrings.",
      "I d rather be shot, if you please.",
      "You d rather be damned!",
      "he said; and so you shall.",
      "No law in England can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine s abominable!",
      "Open your mouth.",
      "He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries.",
      "I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably I would not take it on any account.",
      "said he, releasing me, I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.",
      "If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.",
      "Unnatural cub, come hither!",
      "I ll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted, deluded father.",
      "Now, don t you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?",
      "It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce get me a scissors something fierce and trim!",
      "Besides, it s infernal affectation devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears we re asses enough without them.",
      "Hush, child, hush!",
      "Well then, it is my darling!",
      "wisht, dry thy eyes there s a joy; kiss me.",
      "it won t?",
      "Kiss me, Hareton!",
      "Damn thee, kiss me!",
      "By God, as if I would rear such a monster!",
      "As sure as I m living, I ll break the brat s neck.",
      "Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father s arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and lifted him over the banister.",
      "I cried out that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue him.",
      "As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his hands.",
      "Who is that?",
      "he asked, hearing some one approaching the stairs -foot.",
      "I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell.",
      "There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe.",
      "Heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the accident.",
      "A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.",
      "It expressed, plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge.",
      "Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton s skull on the steps; but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart.",
      "Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered and abashed.",
      "It is your fault, Ellen, he said; you should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from me!",
      "Is he injured anywhere?",
      "Injured!",
      "I cried angrily; if he is not killed, he ll be an idiot!",
      "I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.",
      "You re worse than a heathen treating your own flesh and blood in that manner!",
      "He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror directly.",
      "At the first finger his father laid on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if he would go into convulsions.",
      "You shall not meddle with him!",
      "He hates you they all hate you that s the truth!",
      "A happy family you have; and a pretty state you re come to!",
      "I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly, laughed the misguided man, recovering his hardness.",
      "At present, convey yourself and him away.",
      "And hark you, Heathcliff!",
      "clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.",
      "I wouldn t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire: but that s as my fancy goes.",
      "While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and poured some into a tumbler.",
      "Nay, don t!",
      "I entreated.",
      "Mr. Hindley, do take warning.",
      "Have mercy on this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!",
      "Any one will do better for him than I shall, he answered.",
      "Have mercy on your own soul!",
      "I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand.",
      "Not I!",
      "On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker, exclaimed the blasphemer.",
      "Here s to its hearty damnation!",
      "He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.",
      "It s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink, observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.",
      "He s doing his very utmost; but his constitution defies him.",
      "Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare that he ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.",
      "I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.",
      "Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.",
      "It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and remained silent.",
      "I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began, It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat, The mither beneath the mools heard that, when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her head in, and whispered, Are you alone, Nelly?",
      "Yes, Miss, I replied.",
      "She entered and approached the hearth.",
      "I, supposing she was going to say something, looked up.",
      "The expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious.",
      "Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.",
      "I resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.",
      "Where s Heathcliff?",
      "she said, interrupting me.",
      "About his work in the stable, was my answer.",
      "He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze.",
      "There followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine s cheek to the flags.",
      "Is she sorry for her shameful conduct?",
      "I asked myself.",
      "That will be a novelty: but she may come to the point as she will I sha n t help her!",
      "No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "she cried at last.",
      "I m very unhappy!",
      "A pity, observed I.",
      "You re hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can t make yourself content!",
      "Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?",
      "she pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it.",
      "Is it worth keeping?",
      "I inquired, less sulkily.",
      "Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!",
      "I want to know what I should do.",
      "To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I ve given him an answer.",
      "Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.",
      "Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?",
      "I replied.",
      "To be sure, considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.",
      "If you talk so, I won t tell you any more, she returned, peevishly rising to her feet.",
      "I accepted him, Nelly.",
      "Be quick, and say whether I was wrong!",
      "You accepted him!",
      "Then what good is it discussing the matter?",
      "You have pledged your word, and cannot retract.",
      "But say whether I should have done so do!",
      "she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.",
      "There are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly, I said, sententiously.",
      "First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?",
      "Who can help it?",
      "Of course I do, she answered.",
      "Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious.",
      "Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?",
      "Nonsense, I do that s sufficient.",
      "By no means; you must say why?",
      "Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.",
      "Bad!",
      "was my commentary.",
      "And because he is young and cheerful.",
      "Bad, still.",
      "And because he loves me.",
      "Indifferent, coming there.",
      "And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.",
      "Worst of all.",
      "And now, say how you love him?",
      "As everybody loves You re silly, Nelly.",
      "Not at all Answer.",
      "I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches, and every word he says.",
      "I love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether.",
      "There now!",
      "And why?",
      "Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured!",
      "It s no jest to me!",
      "said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire.",
      "I m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine, I replied.",
      "You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you.",
      "The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without that, probably; and with it you wouldn t, unless he possessed the four former attractions.",
      "No, to be sure not: I should only pity him hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.",
      "But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.",
      "What should hinder you from loving them?",
      "If there be any, they are out of my way: I ve seen none like Edgar.",
      "You may see some; and he won t always be handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.",
      "He is now; and I have only to do with the present.",
      "I wish you would speak rationally.",
      "Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry Mr. Linton.",
      "I don t want your permission for that I _shall_ marry him: and yet you have not told me whether I m right.",
      "Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.",
      "And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about.",
      "Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.",
      "All seems smooth and easy: where is the obstacle?",
      "_Here_!",
      "and _here_!",
      "replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast: in whichever place the soul lives.",
      "In my soul and in my heart, I m convinced I m wrong!",
      "That s very strange!",
      "I cannot make it out.",
      "It s my secret.",
      "But if you will not mock at me, I ll explain it: I can t do it distinctly; but I ll give you a feeling of how I feel.",
      "She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver, and her clasped hands trembled.",
      "Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?",
      "she said, suddenly, after some minutes reflection.",
      "Yes, now and then, I answered.",
      "And so do I. I ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they ve gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.",
      "And this is one: I m going to tell it but take care not to smile at any part of it.",
      "don t, Miss Catherine!",
      "I cried.",
      "We re dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.",
      "Come, come, be merry and like yourself!",
      "Look at little Hareton!",
      "_he s_ dreaming nothing dreary.",
      "How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!",
      "Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude!",
      "You remember him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and innocent.",
      "However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen: it s not long; and I ve no power to be merry to-night.",
      "I won t hear it, I won t hear it!",
      "I repeated, hastily.",
      "I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.",
      "She was vexed, but she did not proceed.",
      "Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time.",
      "If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.",
      "Because you are not fit to go there, I answered.",
      "All sinners would be miserable in heaven.",
      "But it is not for that.",
      "I dreamt once that I was there.",
      "I tell you I won t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine!",
      "I ll go to bed, I interrupted again.",
      "She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.",
      "This is nothing, cried she: I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing for joy.",
      "That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.",
      "I ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn t have thought of it.",
      "It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am.",
      "Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton s is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.",
      "Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff s presence.",
      "Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out noiselessly.",
      "He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no further.",
      "My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I started, and bade her hush!",
      "she asked, gazing nervously round.",
      "Joseph is here, I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road; and Heathcliff will come in with him.",
      "I m not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.",
      "Oh, he couldn t overhear me at the door!",
      "said she.",
      "Give me Hareton, while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.",
      "I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that Heathcliff has no notion of these things.",
      "He has not, has he?",
      "He does not know what being in love is!",
      "I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you, I returned; and if _you_ are his choice, he ll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born!",
      "As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and love, and all!",
      "Have you considered how you ll bear the separation, and how he ll bear to be quite deserted in the world?",
      "Because, Miss Catherine He quite deserted!",
      "we separated!",
      "she exclaimed, with an accent of indignation.",
      "Who is to separate us, pray?",
      "They ll meet the fate of Milo!",
      "Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.",
      "Every Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff.",
      "Oh, that s not what I intend that s not what I mean!",
      "I shouldn t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!",
      "He ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.",
      "Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least.",
      "He will, when he learns my true feelings towards him.",
      "Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars?",
      "whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother s power.",
      "With your husband s money, Miss Catherine?",
      "I asked.",
      "You ll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I m hardly a judge, I think that s the worst motive you ve given yet for being the wife of young Linton.",
      "It is not, retorted she; it is the best!",
      "The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar s sake, too, to satisfy him.",
      "This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself.",
      "I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you.",
      "What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here?",
      "My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself.",
      "If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.",
      "My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I m well aware, as winter changes the trees.",
      "My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.",
      "Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff!",
      "He s always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.",
      "So don t talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it forcibly away.",
      "I was out of patience with her folly!",
      "If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss, I said, it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl.",
      "But trouble me with no more secrets: I ll not promise to keep them.",
      "You ll keep that?",
      "she asked, eagerly.",
      "No, I ll not promise, I repeated.",
      "She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed Hareton, while I made the supper.",
      "After it was cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn t settle it till all was nearly cold.",
      "Then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone.",
      "And how isn t that nowt comed in fro th field, be this time?",
      "What is he about?",
      "girt idle seeght!",
      "demanded the old man, looking round for Heathcliff.",
      "I ll call him, I replied.",
      "He s in the barn, I ve no doubt.",
      "I went and called, but got no answer.",
      "On returning, I whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother s conduct regarding him.",
      "She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would have affected him.",
      "She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we should wait no longer.",
      "He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.",
      "They were ill eneugh for ony fahl manners, he affirmed.",
      "And on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour s supplication before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!",
      "I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs, she said.",
      "And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.",
      "Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked grumbling forth.",
      "Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming I wonder where he is I wonder where he _can_ be!",
      "What did I say, Nelly?",
      "I ve forgotten.",
      "Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon?",
      "Dear!",
      "tell me what I ve said to grieve him?",
      "I do wish he d come.",
      "I do wish he would!",
      "What a noise for nothing!",
      "I cried, though rather uneasy myself.",
      "What a trifle scares you!",
      "It s surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft.",
      "I ll engage he s lurking there.",
      "See if I don t ferret him out!",
      "I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and Joseph s quest ended in the same.",
      "Yon lad gets war und war!",
      "observed he on re-entering.",
      "He s left th gate at t full swing, and Miss s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o corn, and plottered through, raight o er into t meadow!",
      "Hahsomdiver, t maister ull play t devil to-morn, and he ll do weel.",
      "He s patience itsseln wi sich careless, offald craters patience itsseln he is!",
      "Bud he ll not be soa allus yah s see, all on ye!",
      "Yah mun n t drive him out of his heead for nowt!",
      "Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?",
      "interrupted Catherine.",
      "Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?",
      "I sud more likker look for th horse, he replied.",
      "It ud be to more sense.",
      "Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this as black as t chimbley!",
      "und Heathcliff s noan t chap to coom at _my_ whistle happen he ll be less hard o hearing wi _ye_!",
      "It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble.",
      "However, Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.",
      "She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying outright.",
      "She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying.",
      "About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in full fury.",
      "There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire.",
      "We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, though he smote the ungodly.",
      "I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also.",
      "The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living.",
      "He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.",
      "But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes.",
      "She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands before it.",
      "Well, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; you are not bent on getting your death, are you?",
      "Do you know what o clock it is?",
      "Half-past twelve.",
      "Come, come to bed!",
      "there s no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy: he ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he ll stay there now.",
      "He guesses we shouldn t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he d rather avoid having the door opened by the master.",
      "Nay, nay, he s noan at Gimmerton, said Joseph.",
      "I s niver wonder but he s at t bothom of a bog-hoile.",
      "This visitation worn t for nowt, and I wod hev ye to look out, Miss yah muh be t next.",
      "Thank Hivin for all!",
      "All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro th rubbidge!",
      "Yah knaw whet t Scripture ses.",
      "And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them.",
      "I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him.",
      "I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.",
      "Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the fireplace.",
      "The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy.",
      "What ails you, Cathy?",
      "he was saying when I entered: you look as dismal as a drowned whelp.",
      "Why are you so damp and pale, child?",
      "I ve been wet, she answered reluctantly, and I m cold, that s all.",
      "Oh, she is naughty!",
      "I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably sober.",
      "She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night through, and I couldn t prevail on her to stir.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.",
      "The night through, he repeated.",
      "What kept her up?",
      "not fear of the thunder, surely?",
      "That was over hours since.",
      "Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff s absence, as long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn t know how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said nothing.",
      "The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, Ellen, shut the window.",
      "I m starving!",
      "And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers.",
      "She s ill, said Hindley, taking her wrist; I suppose that s the reason she would not go to bed.",
      "Damn it!",
      "I don t want to be troubled with more sickness here.",
      "What took you into the rain?",
      "Running after t lads, as usuald!",
      "croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.",
      "If I war yah, maister, I d just slam t boards i their faces all on em, gentle and simple!",
      "Never a day ut yah re off, but yon cat o Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo s a fine lass!",
      "shoo sits watching for ye i t kitchen; and as yah re in at one door, he s out at t other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side!",
      "It s bonny behaviour, lurking amang t fields, after twelve o t night, wi that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!",
      "They think _I m_ blind; but I m noan: nowt ut t soart!",
      "I seed young Linton boath coming and going, and I seed _yah_ (directing his discourse to me), yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch!",
      "nip up and bolt into th house, t minute yah heard t maister s horse-fit clatter up t road.",
      "Silence, eavesdropper!",
      "cried Catherine; none of your insolence before me!",
      "Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were.",
      "You lie, Cathy, no doubt, answered her brother, and you are a confounded simpleton!",
      "But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last night?",
      "Speak the truth, now.",
      "You need not be afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck.",
      "To prevent it, I shall send him about his business this very morning; and after he s gone, I d advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.",
      "I never saw Heathcliff last night, answered Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: and if you do turn him out of doors, I ll go with him.",
      "But, perhaps, you ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he s gone.",
      "Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate.",
      "Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn t cry for nothing!",
      "I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified me.",
      "I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run for the doctor.",
      "It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she had a fever.",
      "He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage.",
      "Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it through.",
      "Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very grateful.",
      "But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other.",
      "Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier than ever.",
      "Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew.",
      "From that period, for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of a mere servant.",
      "Joseph fell under a ban also: he _would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.",
      "Then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her.",
      "From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.",
      "He was rather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!",
      "Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father s death.",
      "Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights and accompany her here.",
      "Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his letters.",
      "We made a sad parting; but Catherine s tears were more powerful than ours.",
      "When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother.",
      "The former offered me munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand, by-and-by.",
      "And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was ordered.",
      "I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it s very queer to think it, but I ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!",
      "* * * * * At this point of the housekeeper s story she chanced to glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one.",
      "She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself.",
      "And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.",
      "CHAPTER X A charming introduction to a hermit s life!",
      "Four weeks torture, tossing, and sickness!",
      "Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons!",
      "And oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy!",
      "and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.",
      "About seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season.",
      "Scoundrel!",
      "He is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him.",
      "But, alas!",
      "how could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
      "This is quite an easy interval.",
      "I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy something interesting.",
      "Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?",
      "I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.",
      "Yes: I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; and the heroine was married.",
      "I ll ring: she ll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully.",
      "Mrs. Dean came.",
      "It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine, she commenced.",
      "Away, away with it!",
      "I replied; I desire to have The doctor says you must drop the powders.",
      "With all my heart!",
      "Don t interrupt me.",
      "Come and take your seat here.",
      "Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.",
      "Draw your knitting out of your pocket that will do now continue the history of Mr. Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day.",
      "Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman?",
      "or did he get a sizar s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster-country?",
      "or make a fortune more promptly on the English highways?",
      "He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I couldn t give my word for any.",
      "I stated before that I didn t know how he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your leave, I ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not weary you.",
      "Are you feeling better this morning?",
      "Much.",
      "That s good news.",
      "* * * * * I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to expect.",
      "She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection.",
      "They were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly.",
      "It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.",
      "There were no mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who _can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference?",
      "I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour.",
      "He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account.",
      "He many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.",
      "Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it.",
      "Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits before.",
      "The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him.",
      "I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.",
      "It ended.",
      "Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one s interest was not the chief consideration in the other s thoughts.",
      "On a mellow evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering.",
      "It had got dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.",
      "I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me say, Nelly, is that you?",
      "It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.",
      "I turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps.",
      "Something stirred in the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair.",
      "He leant against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.",
      "Who can it be?",
      "I thought.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "The voice has no resemblance to his.",
      "I have waited here an hour, he resumed, while I continued staring; and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.",
      "I dared not enter.",
      "You do not know me?",
      "Look, I m not a stranger!",
      "A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular.",
      "I remembered the eyes.",
      "I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement.",
      "you come back?",
      "Is it really you?",
      "Is it?",
      "Yes, Heathcliff, he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.",
      "Are they at home?",
      "where is she?",
      "Nelly, you are not glad!",
      "you needn t be so disturbed.",
      "Is she here?",
      "Speak!",
      "I want to have one word with her your mistress.",
      "Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.",
      "How will she take it?",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "What will she do?",
      "The surprise bewilders me it will put her out of her head!",
      "And you _are_ Heathcliff!",
      "But altered!",
      "Nay, there s no comprehending it.",
      "Have you been for a soldier?",
      "Go and carry my message, he interrupted, impatiently.",
      "I m in hell till you do!",
      "He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.",
      "At length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the door.",
      "They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen).",
      "Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.",
      "Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously peaceful.",
      "I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter, A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma am.",
      "What does he want?",
      "asked Mrs. Linton.",
      "I did not question him, I answered.",
      "Well, close the curtains, Nelly, she said; and bring up tea.",
      "I ll be back again directly.",
      "She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.",
      "Some one mistress does not expect, I replied.",
      "That Heathcliff you recollect him, sir who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw s. What!",
      "the gipsy the ploughboy?",
      "he cried.",
      "Why did you not say so to Catherine?",
      "Hush!",
      "you must not call him by those names, master, I said.",
      "She d be sadly grieved to hear you.",
      "She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.",
      "I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.",
      "Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court.",
      "He unfastened it, and leant out.",
      "I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly: Don t stand there, love!",
      "Bring the person in, if it be anyone particular.",
      "Ere long, I heard the click of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have surmised an awful calamity.",
      "Oh, Edgar, Edgar!",
      "she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.",
      "Oh, Edgar darling!",
      "Heathcliff s come back he is!",
      "And she tightened her embrace to a squeeze.",
      "Well, well, cried her husband, crossly, don t strangle me for that!",
      "He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.",
      "There is no need to be frantic!",
      "I know you didn t like him, she answered, repressing a little the intensity of her delight.",
      "Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.",
      "Shall I tell him to come up?",
      "Here, he said, into the parlour?",
      "Where else?",
      "she asked.",
      "He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him.",
      "Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression half angry, half laughing at his fastidiousness.",
      "No, she added, after a while; I cannot sit in the kitchen.",
      "Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.",
      "Will that please you, dear?",
      "Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?",
      "If so, give directions.",
      "I ll run down and secure my guest.",
      "I m afraid the joy is too great to be real!",
      "She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.",
      "_You_ bid him step up, he said, addressing me; and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being absurd.",
      "The whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.",
      "I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently anticipating an invitation to enter.",
      "He followed my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.",
      "But the lady s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then she seized Linton s reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.",
      "Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.",
      "He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and youth-like.",
      "His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army.",
      "His countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton s; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.",
      "A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace.",
      "My master s surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.",
      "Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak.",
      "Sit down, sir, he said, at length.",
      "Mrs. Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything occurs to please her.",
      "And I also, answered Heathcliff, especially if it be anything in which I have a part.",
      "I shall stay an hour or two willingly.",
      "He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.",
      "He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.",
      "They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.",
      "Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug, seized Heathcliff s hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.",
      "I shall think it a dream to-morrow!",
      "she cried.",
      "I shall not be able to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.",
      "And yet, cruel Heathcliff!",
      "you don t deserve this welcome.",
      "To be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of me!",
      "A little more than you have thought of me, he murmured.",
      "I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this plan just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself.",
      "Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time!",
      "Nay, you ll not drive me off again.",
      "You were really sorry for me, were you?",
      "Well, there was cause.",
      "I ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!",
      "Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table, interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of politeness.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever he may lodge to-night; and I m thirsty.",
      "She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.",
      "The meal hardly endured ten minutes.",
      "Catherine s cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor drink.",
      "Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely swallowed a mouthful.",
      "Their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer.",
      "I asked, as he departed, if he went to Gimmerton?",
      "No, to Wuthering Heights, he answered: Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I called this morning.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_!",
      "and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!",
      "I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was gone.",
      "Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak?",
      "I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away.",
      "About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs. Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me.",
      "I cannot rest, Ellen, she said, by way of apology.",
      "And I want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness!",
      "Edgar is sulky, because I m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy.",
      "He always contrives to be sick at the least cross!",
      "I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.",
      "What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?",
      "I answered.",
      "As lads they had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised: it s human nature.",
      "Let Mr. Linton alone about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between them.",
      "But does it not show great weakness?",
      "pursued she.",
      "I m not envious: I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella s yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family exhibit for her.",
      "Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper.",
      "It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me.",
      "But they are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same.",
      "You re mistaken, Mrs. Linton, said I.",
      "They humour you: I know what there would be to do if they did not.",
      "You can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires.",
      "You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.",
      "And then we shall fight to the death, sha n t we, Nelly?",
      "she returned, laughing.",
      "No!",
      "I tell you, I have such faith in Linton s love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn t wish to retaliate.",
      "I advised her to value him the more for his affection.",
      "I do, she answered, but he needn t resort to whining for trifles.",
      "It is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone s regard, and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it for me, and been delighted from sympathy.",
      "He must get accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I m sure he behaved excellently!",
      "What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?",
      "He is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!",
      "He explained it, she replied.",
      "I wonder as much as you.",
      "He said he called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living; and finally, desired him to walk in.",
      "There were some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he consented.",
      "Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn t trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.",
      "But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton.",
      "He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother s covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.",
      "It s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!",
      "Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?",
      "None for my friend, she replied: his strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but he can t be made morally worse than he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm.",
      "The event of this evening has reconciled me to God and humanity!",
      "I had risen in angry rebellion against Providence.",
      "Oh, I ve endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly!",
      "If that creature knew how bitter, he d be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance.",
      "It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I.",
      "However, it s over, and I ll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter!",
      "Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I d not only turn the other, but I d ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a proof, I ll go make my peace with Edgar instantly.",
      "Good-night!",
      "I m an angel!",
      "In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.",
      "Heathcliff Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion.",
      "Catherine, also, deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.",
      "He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.",
      "My master s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.",
      "His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest.",
      "She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated.",
      "Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference.",
      "Leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff s disposition: to know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.",
      "And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping.",
      "He would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff s deliberate designing.",
      "We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined over something.",
      "She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience.",
      "We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.",
      "But one day, when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast, complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the doctor.",
      "Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine s harshness which made her unhappy.",
      "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
      "cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable assertion.",
      "You are surely losing your reason.",
      "When have I been harsh, tell me?",
      "Yesterday, sobbed Isabella, and now!",
      "Yesterday!",
      "said her sister-in-law.",
      "On what occasion?",
      "In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "And that s your notion of harshness?",
      "said Catherine, laughing.",
      "It was no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn t care whether you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff s talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears.",
      "Oh, no, wept the young lady; you wished me away, because you knew I liked to be there!",
      "Is she sane?",
      "asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me.",
      "I ll repeat our conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for you.",
      "I don t mind the conversation, she answered: I wanted to be with Well?",
      "said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.",
      "With him: and I won t be always sent off!",
      "she continued, kindling up.",
      "You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but yourself!",
      "You are an impertinent little monkey!",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in surprise.",
      "But I ll not believe this idiocy!",
      "It is impossible that you can covet the admiration of Heathcliff that you consider him an agreeable person!",
      "I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?",
      "No, you have not, said the infatuated girl.",
      "I love him more than ever you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!",
      "I wouldn t be you for a kingdom, then!",
      "Catherine declared, emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely.",
      "Nelly, help me to convince her of her madness.",
      "Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone.",
      "I d as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!",
      "It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes that dream enter your head.",
      "Pray, don t imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior!",
      "He s not a rough diamond a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.",
      "I never say to him, Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them; I say, Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged: and he d crush you like a sparrow s egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge.",
      "I know he couldn t love a Linton; and yet he d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.",
      "There s my picture: and I m his friend so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap.",
      "Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.",
      "For shame!",
      "she repeated, angrily.",
      "You are worse than twenty foes, you poisonous friend!",
      "Ah!",
      "you won t believe me, then?",
      "said Catherine.",
      "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?",
      "I m certain you do, retorted Isabella; and I shudder at you!",
      "Good!",
      "cried the other.",
      "Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.",
      "And I must suffer for her egotism!",
      "she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room.",
      "All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.",
      "But she uttered falsehoods, didn t she?",
      "Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?",
      "Banish him from your thoughts, Miss, I said.",
      "He s a bird of bad omen: no mate for you.",
      "Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can t contradict her.",
      "She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.",
      "Honest people don t hide their deeds.",
      "How has he been living?",
      "how has he got rich?",
      "why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors?",
      "They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.",
      "They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago it was Joseph who told me I met him at Gimmerton: Nelly, he said, we s hae a crowner s quest enow, at ahr folks .",
      "One on em s a most getten his finger cut off wi hauding t other fro stickin hisseln loike a cawlf.",
      "That s maister, yah knaw, at s soa up o going tuh t grand sizes.",
      "He s noan feared o t bench o judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on em, not he!",
      "He fair likes he langs to set his brazened face agean em!",
      "And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he s a rare un.",
      "He can girn a laugh as well s onybody at a raight divil s jest.",
      "Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t Grange?",
      "This is t way on t: up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und can le-light till next day at noon: then, t fooil gangs banning un raving to his cham er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shame; un the knave, why he can caint his brass, un ate, un sleep, un off to his neighbour s to gossip wi t wife.",
      "I course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur s goold runs into his pocket, and her fathur s son gallops down t broad road, while he flees afore to oppen t pikes!",
      "Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff s conduct be true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?",
      "You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!",
      "I ll not listen to your slanders.",
      "What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!",
      "Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time to reflect.",
      "The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather earlier than usual.",
      "Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to _her_.",
      "She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window.",
      "I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.",
      "Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done had it been practicable.",
      "Come in, that s right!",
      "exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair to the fire.",
      "Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.",
      "Heathcliff, I m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you more than myself.",
      "I expect you to feel flattered.",
      "Nay, it s not Nelly; don t look at her!",
      "My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.",
      "It lies in your own power to be Edgar s brother!",
      "No, no, Isabella, you sha n t run off, she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly.",
      "We were quarrelling like cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal oblivion!",
      "said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her, I d thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.",
      "As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.",
      "By no means!",
      "cried Mrs. Linton in answer.",
      "I won t be named a dog in the manger again.",
      "You _shall_ stay: now then!",
      "Heathcliff, why don t you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news?",
      "Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.",
      "I m sure she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen?",
      "And she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday s walk, from sorrow and rage that I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable.",
      "I think you belie her, said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face them.",
      "She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!",
      "And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.",
      "The poor thing couldn t bear that; she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer s with crescents of red.",
      "There s a tigress!",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain.",
      "Begone, for God s sake, and hide your vixen face!",
      "How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_.",
      "Can t you fancy the conclusions he ll draw?",
      "Look, Heathcliff!",
      "they are instruments that will do execution you must beware of your eyes.",
      "I d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me, he answered, brutally, when the door had closed after her.",
      "But what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?",
      "You were not speaking the truth, were you?",
      "I assure you I was, she returned.",
      "She has been dying for your sake several weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the purpose of mitigating her adoration.",
      "But don t notice it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that s all.",
      "I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.",
      "And I like her too ill to attempt it, said he, except in a very ghoulish fashion.",
      "You d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they detestably resemble Linton s. Delectably!",
      "observed Catherine.",
      "They are dove s eyes angel s!",
      "She s her brother s heir, is she not?",
      "he asked, after a brief silence.",
      "I should be sorry to think so, returned his companion.",
      "Half a dozen nephews shall erase her title, please heaven!",
      "Abstract your mind from the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour s goods; remember _this_ neighbour s goods are mine.",
      "If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that, said Heathcliff; but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.",
      "From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts.",
      "The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of the evening.",
      "I saw him smile to himself grin rather and lapse into ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment.",
      "I determined to watch his movements.",
      "My heart invariably cleaved to the master s, in preference to Catherine s side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she she could not be called the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings.",
      "I wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.",
      "His visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also.",
      "His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.",
      "I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy.",
      "CHAPTER XI Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I ve got up in a sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.",
      "I ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways; and then I ve recollected his confirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.",
      "One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to Gimmerton.",
      "It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry.",
      "I came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a guide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.",
      "The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at once a gush of child s sensations flowed into my heart.",
      "Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before.",
      "I gazed long at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate.",
      "Poor Hindley!",
      "I exclaimed, involuntarily.",
      "I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine!",
      "It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the Heights.",
      "Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead!",
      "I thought or should die soon!",
      "supposing it were a sign of death!",
      "The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.",
      "The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate.",
      "That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars.",
      "Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.",
      "God bless thee, darling!",
      "I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears.",
      "Hareton, it s Nelly!",
      "Nelly, thy nurse.",
      "He retreated out of arm s length, and picked up a large flint.",
      "I am come to see thy father, Hareton, I added, guessing from the action that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised as one with me.",
      "He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued, from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity.",
      "You may be certain this grieved more than angered me.",
      "Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.",
      "He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him.",
      "I showed another, keeping it out of his reach.",
      "Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?",
      "The curate?",
      "Damn the curate, and thee!",
      "Gie me that, he replied.",
      "Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it, said I.",
      "Who s your master?",
      "Devil daddy, was his answer.",
      "And what do you learn from daddy?",
      "He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.",
      "What does he teach you?",
      "Naught, said he, but to keep out of his gait.",
      "Daddy cannot bide me, because I swear at him.",
      "and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?",
      "I observed.",
      "Ay nay, he drawled.",
      "Who, then?",
      "Heathcliff.",
      "I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Ay!",
      "he answered again.",
      "Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the sentences I known t: he pays dad back what he gies to me he curses daddy for cursing me.",
      "He says I mun do as I will.",
      "And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?",
      "I pursued.",
      "No, I was told the curate should have his teeth dashed down his throat, if he stepped over the threshold Heathcliff had promised that!",
      "I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.",
      "He went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley, Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.",
      "This is not much connected with Miss Isabella s affair: except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton s pleasure.",
      "The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court.",
      "She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and we found it a great comfort.",
      "Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.",
      "Now, as soon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house-front.",
      "I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of sight.",
      "He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he laid his hand on her arm.",
      "She averted her face: he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer.",
      "There was another rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.",
      "Judas!",
      "Traitor!",
      "I ejaculated.",
      "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
      "A deliberate deceiver.",
      "Who is, Nelly?",
      "said Catherine s voice at my elbow: I had been over-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.",
      "Your worthless friend!",
      "I answered, warmly: the sneaking rascal yonder.",
      "Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us he is coming in!",
      "I wonder will he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when he told you he hated her?",
      "Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.",
      "I couldn t withhold giving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.",
      "To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!",
      "You want setting down in your right place!",
      "Heathcliff, what are you about, raising this stir?",
      "I said you must let Isabella alone!",
      "I beg you will, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the bolts against you!",
      "God forbid that he should try!",
      "answered the black villain.",
      "I detested him just then.",
      "God keep him meek and patient!",
      "Every day I grow madder after sending him to heaven!",
      "said Catherine, shutting the inner door.",
      "Don t vex me.",
      "Why have you disregarded my request?",
      "Did she come across you on purpose?",
      "What is it to you?",
      "he growled.",
      "I have a right to kiss her, if she chooses; and you have no right to object.",
      "I am not _your_ husband: _you_ needn t be jealous of me!",
      "I m not jealous of you, replied the mistress; I m jealous for you.",
      "Clear your face: you sha n t scowl at me!",
      "If you like Isabella, you shall marry her.",
      "But do you like her?",
      "Tell the truth, Heathcliff!",
      "There, you won t answer.",
      "I m certain you don t. And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?",
      "Mr. Linton should approve, returned my lady, decisively.",
      "He might spare himself the trouble, said Heathcliff: I could do as well without his approbation.",
      "And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to speak a few words now, while we are at it.",
      "I want you to be aware that I _know_ you have treated me infernally infernally!",
      "Do you hear?",
      "And if you flatter yourself that I don t perceive it, you are a fool; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you fancy I ll suffer unrevenged, I ll convince you of the contrary, in a very little while!",
      "Meantime, thank you for telling me your sister-in-law s secret: I swear I ll make the most of it.",
      "And stand you aside!",
      "What new phase of his character is this?",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in amazement.",
      "I ve treated you infernally and you ll take your revenge!",
      "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
      "How have I treated you infernally?",
      "I seek no revenge on you, replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.",
      "That s not the plan.",
      "The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don t turn against him; they crush those beneath them.",
      "You are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able.",
      "Having levelled my palace, don t erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home.",
      "If I imagined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I d cut my throat!",
      "Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?",
      "cried Catherine.",
      "Well, I won t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul.",
      "Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.",
      "You prove it.",
      "Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.",
      "Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you ll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.",
      "The conversation ceased.",
      "Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy.",
      "The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could neither lay nor control it.",
      "He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.",
      "Ellen, said he, when I entered, have you seen your mistress?",
      "Yes; she s in the kitchen, sir, I answered.",
      "She s sadly put out by Mr. Heathcliff s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it s time to arrange his visits on another footing.",
      "There s harm in being too soft, and now it s come to this .",
      "And I related the scene in the court, and, as near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.",
      "I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest.",
      "Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close.",
      "His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame.",
      "This is insufferable!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "It is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me!",
      "Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen.",
      "Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian I have humoured her enough.",
      "He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me, to the kitchen.",
      "Its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently.",
      "He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed, abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.",
      "How is this?",
      "said Linton, addressing her; what notion of propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard?",
      "I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get used to it too!",
      "Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?",
      "asked the mistress, in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation.",
      "Heathcliff, who had raised his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton s attention to him.",
      "He succeeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.",
      "I ve been so far forbearing with you, sir, he said quietly; not that I was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance, I acquiesced foolishly.",
      "Your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.",
      "Three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.",
      "Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision.",
      "Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!",
      "It is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.",
      "By God!",
      "Mr. Linton, I m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!",
      "My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.",
      "I obeyed the hint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.",
      "Fair means!",
      "she said, in answer to her husband s look of angry surprise.",
      "If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or allow yourself to be beaten.",
      "It will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess.",
      "No, I ll swallow the key before you shall get it!",
      "I m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!",
      "After constant indulgence of one s weak nature, and the other s bad one, I earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!",
      "Edgar, I was defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for daring to think an evil thought of me!",
      "It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master.",
      "He tried to wrest the key from Catherine s grasp, and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.",
      "For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.",
      "He leant on the back of a chair, and covered his face.",
      "Oh, heavens!",
      "In old days this would win you knighthood!",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton.",
      "We are vanquished!",
      "Heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of mice.",
      "Cheer up!",
      "you sha n t be hurt!",
      "Your type is not a lamb, it s a sucking leveret.",
      "I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!",
      "said her friend.",
      "I compliment you on your taste.",
      "And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me!",
      "I would not strike him with my fist, but I d kick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.",
      "Is he weeping, or is he going to faint for fear?",
      "The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.",
      "He d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man.",
      "It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front entrance.",
      "There!",
      "you ve done with coming here, cried Catherine.",
      "Get away, now; he ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.",
      "If he did overhear us, of course he d never forgive you.",
      "You ve played me an ill turn, Heathcliff!",
      "But go make haste!",
      "I d rather see Edgar at bay than you.",
      "Do you suppose I m going with that blow burning in my gullet?",
      "he thundered.",
      "By hell, no!",
      "I ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut before I cross the threshold!",
      "If I don t floor him now, I shall murder him some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!",
      "He is not coming, I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.",
      "There s the coachman and the two gardeners; you ll surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them!",
      "Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.",
      "The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them.",
      "They had already entered the court.",
      "Heathcliff, on the second thoughts, resolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the poker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they tramped in.",
      "Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.",
      "She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was anxious to keep her in ignorance.",
      "I m nearly distracted, Nelly!",
      "she exclaimed, throwing herself on the sofa.",
      "A thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head!",
      "Tell Isabella to shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else aggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.",
      "And, Nelly, say to Edgar, if you see him again to-night, that I m in danger of being seriously ill.",
      "I wish it may prove true.",
      "He has startled and distressed me shockingly!",
      "I want to frighten him.",
      "Besides, he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings; I m certain I should recriminate, and God knows where we should end!",
      "Will you do so, my good Nelly?",
      "You are aware that I am no way blamable in this matter.",
      "What possessed him to turn listener?",
      "Heathcliff s talk was outrageous, after you left us; but I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.",
      "Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool s craving to hear evil of self, that haunts some people like a demon!",
      "Had Edgar never gathered our conversation, he would never have been the worse for it.",
      "Really, when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care hardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!",
      "Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend if Edgar will be mean and jealous, I ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.",
      "That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity!",
      "But it s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I d not take Linton by surprise with it.",
      "To this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.",
      "I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious about me.",
      "The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt, rather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control herself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish to frighten her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness.",
      "Therefore I said nothing when I met the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.",
      "He began to speak first.",
      "Remain where you are, Catherine, he said; without any anger in his voice, but with much sorrowful despondency.",
      "I shall not stay.",
      "I am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn whether, after this evening s events, you intend to continue your intimacy with Oh, for mercy s sake, interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, for mercy s sake, let us hear no more of it now!",
      "Your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.",
      "To get rid of me, answer my question, persevered Mr. Linton.",
      "You _must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.",
      "I have found that you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.",
      "Will you give up Heathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?",
      "It is impossible for you to be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_ to know which you choose.",
      "I require to be let alone!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, furiously.",
      "I demand it!",
      "Don t you see I can scarcely stand?",
      "Edgar, you you leave me!",
      "She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.",
      "It was enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!",
      "There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!",
      "Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.",
      "He told me to fetch some water.",
      "She had no breath for speaking.",
      "I brought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face.",
      "In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.",
      "Linton looked terrified.",
      "There is nothing in the world the matter, I whispered.",
      "I did not want him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.",
      "She has blood on her lips!",
      "he said, shuddering.",
      "Never mind!",
      "I answered, tartly.",
      "And I told him how she had resolved, previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.",
      "I incautiously gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up her hair flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally.",
      "I made up my mind for broken bones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then rushed from the room.",
      "The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.",
      "As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask whether she would have some carried up.",
      "she replied, peremptorily.",
      "The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow after, and received the same answer.",
      "Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife s occupations.",
      "Isabella and he had had an hour s interview, during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for Heathcliff s advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him.",
      "CHAPTER XII While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that he never opened wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation and _she_ fasted pertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.",
      "I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady s name, since he might not hear her voice.",
      "I determined they should come about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.",
      "Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin of gruel, for she believed she was dying.",
      "That I set down as a speech meant for Edgar s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself and brought her some tea and dry toast.",
      "She ate and drank eagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.",
      "Oh, I will die, she exclaimed, since no one cares anything about me.",
      "I wish I had not taken that.",
      "Then a good while after I heard her murmur, No, I ll not die he d be glad he does not love me at all he would never miss me!",
      "Did you want anything, ma am?",
      "I inquired, still preserving my external composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated manner.",
      "What is that apathetic being doing?",
      "she demanded, pushing the thick entangled locks from her wasted face.",
      "Has he fallen into a lethargy, or is he dead?",
      "Neither, replied I; if you mean Mr. Linton.",
      "He s tolerably well, I think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is continually among his books, since he has no other society.",
      "I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.",
      "Among his books!",
      "she cried, confounded.",
      "And I dying!",
      "I on the brink of the grave!",
      "My God!",
      "does he know how I m altered?",
      "continued she, staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.",
      "Is that Catherine Linton?",
      "He imagines me in a pet in play, perhaps.",
      "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
      "Nelly, if it be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I ll choose between these two: either to starve at once that would be no punishment unless he had a heart or to recover, and leave the country.",
      "Are you speaking the truth about him now?",
      "Take care.",
      "Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my life?",
      "Why, ma am, I answered, the master has no idea of your being deranged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.",
      "You think not?",
      "Cannot you tell him I will?",
      "Persuade him!",
      "speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!",
      "No, you forget, Mrs. Linton, I suggested, that you have eaten some food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good effects.",
      "If I were only sure it would kill him, she interrupted, I d kill myself directly!",
      "These three awful nights I ve never closed my lids and oh, I ve been tormented!",
      "I ve been haunted, Nelly!",
      "But I begin to fancy you don t like me.",
      "How strange!",
      "I thought, though everybody hated and despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.",
      "And they have all turned to enemies in a few hours.",
      "_They_ have, I m positive; the people _here_.",
      "How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!",
      "Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be so dreadful to watch Catherine go.",
      "And Edgar standing solemnly by to see it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to his house, and going back to his _books_!",
      "What in the name of all that feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?",
      "She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr. Linton s philosophical resignation.",
      "Tossing about, she increased her feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth; then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the window.",
      "We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the north-east, and I objected.",
      "Both the expressions flitting over her face, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor s injunction that she should not be crossed.",
      "A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.",
      "That s a turkey s, she murmured to herself; and this is a wild duck s; and this is a pigeon s. Ah, they put pigeons feathers in the pillows no wonder I couldn t die!",
      "Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I lie down.",
      "And here is a moor-cock s; and this I should know it among a thousand it s a lapwing s. Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the middle of the moor.",
      "It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.",
      "This feather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter, full of little skeletons.",
      "Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old ones dared not come.",
      "I made him promise he d never shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn t. Yes, here are more!",
      "Did he shoot my lapwings, Nelly?",
      "Are they red, any of them?",
      "Let me look.",
      "Give over with that baby-work!",
      "I interrupted, dragging the pillow away, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its contents by handfuls.",
      "Lie down and shut your eyes: you re wandering.",
      "There s a mess!",
      "The down is flying about like snow.",
      "I went here and there collecting it.",
      "I see in you, Nelly, she continued dreamily, an aged woman: you have grey hair and bent shoulders.",
      "This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool.",
      "That s what you ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.",
      "I m not wandering: you re mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I m conscious it s night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet.",
      "The black press?",
      "where is that?",
      "You are talking in your sleep!",
      "It s against the wall, as it always is, she replied.",
      "It _does_ appear odd I see a face in it!",
      "There s no press in the room, and never was, said I, resuming my seat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.",
      "Don t _you_ see that face?",
      "she inquired, gazing earnestly at the mirror.",
      "And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be her own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.",
      "It s behind there still!",
      "she pursued, anxiously.",
      "And it stirred.",
      "Who is it?",
      "I hope it will not come out when you are gone!",
      "Nelly, the room is haunted!",
      "I m afraid of being alone!",
      "I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of shudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze towards the glass.",
      "There s nobody here!",
      "I insisted.",
      "It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you knew it a while since.",
      "Myself!",
      "she gasped, and the clock is striking twelve!",
      "It s true, then!",
      "that s dreadful!",
      "Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.",
      "I attempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek the shawl had dropped from the frame.",
      "Why, what _is_ the matter?",
      "cried I.",
      "Who is coward now?",
      "Wake up!",
      "That is the glass the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and there am I too by your side.",
      "Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually passed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.",
      "I thought I was at home, she sighed.",
      "I thought I was lying in my chamber at Wuthering Heights.",
      "Because I m weak, my brain got confused, and I screamed unconsciously.",
      "Don t say anything; but stay with me.",
      "I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.",
      "A sound sleep would do you good, ma am, I answered: and I hope this suffering will prevent your trying starving again.",
      "Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!",
      "she went on bitterly, wringing her hands.",
      "And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.",
      "Do let me feel it it comes straight down the moor do let me have one breath!",
      "To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.",
      "A cold blast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post.",
      "She lay still now, her face bathed in tears.",
      "Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.",
      "How long is it since I shut myself in here?",
      "she asked, suddenly reviving.",
      "It was Monday evening, I replied, and this is Thursday night, or rather Friday morning, at present.",
      "of the same week?",
      "she exclaimed.",
      "Only that brief time?",
      "Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper, observed I.",
      "Well, it seems a weary number of hours, she muttered doubtfully: it must be more.",
      "I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room desperate.",
      "As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.",
      "I couldn t explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in teasing me!",
      "I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice.",
      "Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I ll tell you what I thought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason.",
      "I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking, I could not recollect.",
      "I pondered, and worried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank!",
      "I did not recall that they had been at all.",
      "I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff.",
      "I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the table-top!",
      "I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.",
      "I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause.",
      "But, supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world.",
      "You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled!",
      "Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to unsettle me!",
      "You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet!",
      "Oh, I m burning!",
      "I wish I were out of doors!",
      "I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening under them!",
      "Why am I so changed?",
      "why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
      "I m sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills.",
      "Open the window again wide: fasten it open!",
      "Quick, why don t you move?",
      "Because I won t give you your death of cold, I answered.",
      "You won t give me a chance of life, you mean, she said sullenly.",
      "However, I m not helpless yet; I ll open it myself.",
      "And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.",
      "I entreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire.",
      "But I soon found her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious, I became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).",
      "There was no moon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and those at Wuthering Heights were never visible still she asserted she caught their shining.",
      "Look!",
      "she cried eagerly, that s my room with the candle in it, and the trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph s garret.",
      "Joseph sits up late, doesn t he?",
      "He s waiting till I come home that he may lock the gate.",
      "Well, he ll wait a while yet.",
      "It s a rough journey, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go that journey!",
      "We ve braved its ghosts often together, and dared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.",
      "But, Heathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture?",
      "If you do, I ll keep you.",
      "I ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the church down over me, but I won t rest till you are with me.",
      "I never will!",
      "She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.",
      "He s considering he d rather I d come to him!",
      "Find a way, then!",
      "not through that kirkyard.",
      "You are slow!",
      "Be content, you always followed me!",
      "Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I could reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of herself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton entered.",
      "He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.",
      "Oh, sir!",
      "I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the sight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.",
      "My poor mistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all; pray, come and persuade her to go to bed.",
      "Forget your anger, for she s hard to guide any way but her own.",
      "Catherine ill?",
      "he said, hastening to us.",
      "Shut the window, Ellen!",
      "why He was silent.",
      "The haggardness of Mrs. Linton s appearance smote him speechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified astonishment.",
      "She s been fretting here, I continued, and eating scarcely anything, and never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and so we couldn t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it ourselves; but it is nothing.",
      "I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.",
      "It is nothing, is it, Ellen Dean?",
      "he said sternly.",
      "You shall account more clearly for keeping me ignorant of this!",
      "And he took his wife in his arms, and looked at her with anguish.",
      "At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her abstracted gaze.",
      "The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her eyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her attention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.",
      "you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?",
      "she said, with angry animation.",
      "You are one of those things that are ever found when least wanted, and when you are wanted, never!",
      "I suppose we shall have plenty of lamentations now I see we shall but they can t keep me from my narrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I m bound before spring is over!",
      "There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please yourself whether you go to them or come to me!",
      "Catherine, what have you done?",
      "commenced the master.",
      "Am I nothing to you any more?",
      "Do you love that wretch Heath Hush!",
      "cried Mrs. Linton.",
      "Hush, this moment!",
      "You mention that name and I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!",
      "What you touch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top before you lay hands on me again.",
      "I don t want you, Edgar: I m past wanting you.",
      "Return to your books.",
      "I m glad you possess a consolation, for all you had in me is gone.",
      "Her mind wanders, sir, I interposed.",
      "She has been talking nonsense the whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and she ll rally.",
      "Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.",
      "I desire no further advice from you, answered Mr. Linton.",
      "You knew your mistress s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.",
      "And not to give me one hint of how she has been these three days!",
      "It was heartless!",
      "Months of sickness could not cause such a change!",
      "I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another s wicked waywardness.",
      "I knew Mrs. Linton s nature to be headstrong and domineering, cried I: but I didn t know that you wished to foster her fierce temper!",
      "I didn t know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant s wages!",
      "Well, it will teach me to be careful next time.",
      "Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!",
      "The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen Dean, he replied.",
      "You d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?",
      "said I. Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to drop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison the mistress against you?",
      "Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our conversation.",
      "Nelly has played traitor, she exclaimed, passionately.",
      "Nelly is my hidden enemy.",
      "You witch!",
      "So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!",
      "Let me go, and I ll make her rue!",
      "I ll make her howl a recantation!",
      "A maniac s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to disengage herself from Linton s arms.",
      "I felt no inclination to tarry the event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I quitted the chamber.",
      "In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind.",
      "Notwithstanding my hurry, I stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.",
      "My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than vision, Miss Isabella s springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.",
      "I quickly released the animal, and lifted it into the garden.",
      "I had seen it follow its mistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.",
      "While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses feet galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o clock in the morning.",
      "Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine Linton s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.",
      "He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before.",
      "Nelly Dean, said he, I can t help fancying there s an extra cause for this.",
      "What has there been to do at the Grange?",
      "We ve odd reports up here.",
      "A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a trifle; and that sort of people should not either.",
      "It s hard work bringing them through fevers, and such things.",
      "How did it begin?",
      "The master will inform you, I answered; but you are acquainted with the Earnshaws violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.",
      "I may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.",
      "She was struck during a tempest of passion with a kind of fit.",
      "That s her account, at least: for she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.",
      "Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.",
      "Mr. Linton will be sorry?",
      "observed Kenneth, interrogatively.",
      "Sorry?",
      "he ll break his heart should anything happen!",
      "Don t alarm him more than necessary.",
      "Well, I told him to beware, said my companion; and he must bide the consequences of neglecting my warning!",
      "Hasn t he been intimate with Mr. Heathcliff lately?",
      "Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange, answered I, though more on the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because the master likes his company.",
      "At present he s discharged from the trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss Linton which he manifested.",
      "I hardly think he ll be taken in again.",
      "And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?",
      "was the doctor s next question.",
      "I m not in her confidence, returned I, reluctant to continue the subject.",
      "No, she s a sly one, he remarked, shaking his head.",
      "She keeps her own counsel!",
      "But she s a real little fool.",
      "I have it from good authority that last night (and a pretty night it was!)",
      "she and Heathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with him!",
      "My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was to be he didn t hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!",
      "This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most of the way back.",
      "The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.",
      "I spared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.",
      "On ascending to Isabella s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty.",
      "Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton s illness might have arrested her rash step.",
      "But what could be done now?",
      "There was a bare possibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly.",
      "_I_ could not pursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second grief!",
      "I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly composed countenance to announce him.",
      "Catherine lay in a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully expressive features.",
      "The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her perfect and constant tranquillity.",
      "To me, he signified the threatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.",
      "I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as they encountered each other in their vocations.",
      "Every one was active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.",
      "I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight.",
      "One of the maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: Oh, dear, dear!",
      "What mun we have next?",
      "Master, master, our young lady Hold your noise!",
      "cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.",
      "Speak lower, Mary What is the matter?",
      "said Mr. Linton.",
      "What ails your young lady?",
      "She s gone, she s gone!",
      "Yon Heathcliff s run off wi her!",
      "gasped the girl.",
      "That is not true!",
      "exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.",
      "It cannot be: how has the idea entered your head?",
      "Ellen Dean, go and seek her.",
      "It is incredible: it cannot be.",
      "As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand to know her reasons for such an assertion.",
      "Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here, she stammered, and he asked whether we weren t in trouble at the Grange.",
      "I thought he meant for missis s sickness, so I answered, yes.",
      "Then says he, There s somebody gone after em, I guess?",
      "I stared.",
      "He saw I knew nought about it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse s shoe fastened at a blacksmith s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not very long after midnight!",
      "and how the blacksmith s lass had got up to spy who they were: she knew them both directly.",
      "And she noticed the man Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob dy could mistake him, besides put a sovereign in her father s hand for payment.",
      "The lady had a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.",
      "Heathcliff held both bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and went as fast as the rough roads would let them.",
      "The lass said nothing to her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.",
      "I ran and peeped, for form s sake, into Isabella s room; confirming, when I returned, the servant s statement.",
      "Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a word.",
      "Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back, I inquired.",
      "How should we do?",
      "She went of her own accord, answered the master; she had a right to go if she pleased.",
      "Trouble me no more about her.",
      "Hereafter she is only my sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned me.",
      "And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry further, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what property she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I knew it.",
      "CHAPTER XIII For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs. Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever.",
      "No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her.",
      "Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety in fact, that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine s life was declared out of danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.",
      "The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following March.",
      "Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.",
      "These are the earliest flowers at the Heights, she exclaimed.",
      "They remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.",
      "Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?",
      "The snow is quite gone down here, darling, replied her husband; and I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.",
      "Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.",
      "I shall never be there but once more, said the invalid; and then you ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.",
      "Next spring you ll long again to have me under this roof, and you ll look back and think you were happy to-day.",
      "Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.",
      "We knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially removed by a change of scene.",
      "The master told me to light a fire in the many-weeks deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber.",
      "By evening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared.",
      "To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar s arm.",
      "Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was.",
      "And there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton s heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger s gripe, by the birth of an heir.",
      "I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.",
      "It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.",
      "Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon.",
      "I ll read it: for I keep it yet.",
      "Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.",
      "* * * * * DEAR ELLEN, it begins, I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.",
      "I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him.",
      "Still, I must write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.",
      "Inform Edgar that I d give the world to see his face again that my heart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!",
      "_I can t follow it though_ (these words are underlined) they need not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient affection.",
      "The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.",
      "I want to ask you two questions: the first is, How did you contrive to preserve the common sympathies of human nature when you resided here?",
      "I cannot recognise any sentiment which those around share with me.",
      "The second question I have great interest in; it is this Is Mr. Heathcliff a man?",
      "If so, is he mad?",
      "And if not, is he a devil?",
      "I sha n t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.",
      "Don t write, but come, and bring me something from Edgar.",
      "Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led to imagine the Heights will be.",
      "It is to amuse myself that I dwell on such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.",
      "I should laugh and dance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and the rest was an unnatural dream!",
      "The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I judged it to be six o clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle.",
      "He did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit.",
      "His first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn away.",
      "Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle.",
      "Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen a dingy, untidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it was in your charge.",
      "By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb and dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his mouth.",
      "This is Edgar s legal nephew, I reflected mine in a manner; I must shake hands, and yes I must kiss him.",
      "It is right to establish a good understanding at the beginning.",
      "I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said How do you do, my dear?",
      "He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.",
      "Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?",
      "was my next essay at conversation.",
      "An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not frame off rewarded my perseverance.",
      "Hey, Throttler, lad!",
      "whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred bull-dog from its lair in a corner.",
      "Now, wilt thou be ganging?",
      "he asked authoritatively.",
      "Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait till the others should enter.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and replied Mim!",
      "mim!",
      "Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?",
      "Mincing un munching!",
      "How can I tell whet ye say?",
      "I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!",
      "I cried, thinking him deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.",
      "None o me!",
      "I getten summut else to do, he answered, and continued his work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and countenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I m sure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.",
      "I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself.",
      "After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine s with all their beauty annihilated.",
      "What s your business here?",
      "he demanded, grimly.",
      "My name _was_ Isabella Linton, I replied.",
      "You ve seen me before, sir.",
      "I m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here I suppose by your permission.",
      "Is he come back, then?",
      "asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.",
      "Yes we came just now, I said; but he left me by the kitchen door; and when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the place, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.",
      "It s well the hellish villain has kept his word!",
      "growled my future host, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering Heathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and threats of what he would have done had the fiend deceived him.",
      "I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that intention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.",
      "There was a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.",
      "I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!",
      "Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer.",
      "He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him again.",
      "You ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless, seated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and remembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing the only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the Atlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass them!",
      "I questioned with myself where must I turn for comfort?",
      "and mind you don t tell Edgar, or Catherine above every sorrow beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against Heathcliff!",
      "I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost gladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear their intermeddling.",
      "I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and still my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and perfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself out at intervals.",
      "I listened to detect a woman s voice in the house, and filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.",
      "I was not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.",
      "Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed I m tired with my journey, and I want to go to bed!",
      "Where is the maid-servant?",
      "Direct me to her, as she won t come to me!",
      "We have none, he answered; you must wait on yourself!",
      "Where must I sleep, then?",
      "I sobbed; I was beyond regarding self-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.",
      "Joseph will show you Heathcliff s chamber, said he; open that door he s in there.",
      "I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the strangest tone Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your bolt don t omit it!",
      "Well!",
      "But why, Mr. Earnshaw?",
      "I did not relish the notion of deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.",
      "Look here!",
      "he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached to the barrel.",
      "That s a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?",
      "I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.",
      "If once I find it open he s done for; I do it invariably, even though the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by killing him.",
      "You fight against that devil for love as long as you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!",
      "I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.",
      "A hideous notion struck me: how powerful I should be possessing such an instrument!",
      "I took it from his hand, and touched the blade.",
      "He looked astonished at the expression my face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was covetousness.",
      "He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife, and returned it to its concealment.",
      "I don t care if you tell him, said he.",
      "Put him on his guard, and watch for him.",
      "You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not shock you.",
      "What has Heathcliff done to you?",
      "In what has he wronged you, to warrant this appalling hatred?",
      "Wouldn t it be wiser to bid him quit the house?",
      "thundered Earnshaw; should he offer to leave me, he s a dead man: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!",
      "Am I to lose _all_, without a chance of retrieval?",
      "Is Hareton to be a beggar?",
      "Oh, damnation!",
      "I _will_ have it back; and I ll have _his_ gold too; and then his blood; and hell shall have his soul!",
      "It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before!",
      "You ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master s habits.",
      "He is clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.",
      "I shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant s ill-bred moroseness as comparatively agreeable.",
      "He now recommenced his moody walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.",
      "Joseph was bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.",
      "The contents of the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, _I ll_ make the porridge!",
      "I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw, I continued, directs me to wait on myself: I will.",
      "I m not going to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.",
      "Gooid Lord!",
      "he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed stockings from the knee to the ankle.",
      "If there s to be fresh ortherings just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev a _mistress_ set o er my heead, it s like time to be flitting.",
      "I niver _did_ think to see t day that I mud lave th owld place but I doubt it s nigh at hand!",
      "This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled speedily to drive off the remembrance.",
      "It racked me to recall past happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal fell into the water.",
      "Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing indignation.",
      "Thear!",
      "he ejaculated.",
      "Hareton, thou willn t sup thy porridge to-neeght; they ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.",
      "Thear, agean!",
      "I d fling in bowl un all, if I wer ye!",
      "There, pale t guilp off, un then ye ll hae done wi t. Bang, bang.",
      "It s a mercy t bothom isn t deaved out!",
      "It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four had been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the expansive lip.",
      "I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.",
      "The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me, repeatedly, that the barn was every bit as good as I, and every bit as wollsome, and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.",
      "Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.",
      "I shall have my supper in another room, I said.",
      "Have you no place you call a parlour?",
      "_Parlour_!",
      "he echoed, sneeringly, _parlour_!",
      "Nay, we ve noa _parlours_.",
      "If yah dunnut loike wer company, there s maister s; un if yah dunnut loike maister, there s us.",
      "Then I shall go upstairs, I answered; show me a chamber.",
      "I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.",
      "With great grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we mounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the apartments we passed.",
      "Here s a rahm, he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on hinges.",
      "It s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.",
      "There s a pack o corn i t corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye re feared o muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o t top on t. The rahm was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain; various sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare space in the middle.",
      "Why, man, I exclaimed, facing him angrily, this is not a place to sleep in.",
      "I wish to see my bed-room.",
      "_Bed-rume_!",
      "he repeated, in a tone of mockery.",
      "Yah s see all t _bed-rumes_ thear is yon s mine.",
      "He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.",
      "What do I want with yours?",
      "I retorted.",
      "I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does not lodge at the top of the house, does he?",
      "it s Maister _Hathecliff s_ ye re wanting?",
      "cried he, as if making a new discovery.",
      "Couldn t ye ha said soa, at onst?",
      "un then, I mud ha telled ye, baht all this wark, that that s just one ye cannut see he allas keeps it locked, un nob dy iver mells on t but hisseln.",
      "You ve a nice house, Joseph, I could not refrain from observing, and pleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with theirs!",
      "However, that is not to the present purpose there are other rooms.",
      "For heaven s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!",
      "He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the wooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt and the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.",
      "There was a carpet a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the vallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to trail upon the floor.",
      "The chairs were also damaged, many of them severely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.",
      "I was endeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession, when my fool of a guide announced, This here is t maister s. My supper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience exhausted.",
      "I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of refuge, and means of repose.",
      "Whear the divil?",
      "began the religious elder.",
      "The Lord bless us!",
      "The Lord forgie us!",
      "Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang?",
      "ye marred, wearisome nowt!",
      "Ye ve seen all but Hareton s bit of a cham er.",
      "There s not another hoile to lig down in i th hahse!",
      "I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then seated myself at the stairs -head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.",
      "exclaimed Joseph.",
      "Weel done, Miss Cathy!",
      "Howsiver, t maister sall just tum le o er them brocken pots; un then we s hear summut; we s hear how it s to be.",
      "Gooid-for-naught madling!",
      "ye desarve pining fro this to Churstmas, flinging t precious gifts uh God under fooit i yer flaysome rages!",
      "But I m mista en if ye shew yer sperrit lang.",
      "Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?",
      "I nobbut wish he may catch ye i that plisky.",
      "I nobbut wish he may.",
      "And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with him; and I remained in the dark.",
      "The period of reflection succeeding this silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.",
      "An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley.",
      "I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief.",
      "Our labours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw s tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.",
      "The dog s endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping.",
      "I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door.",
      "Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed.",
      "I had found shelter in Hareton s room, and the old man, on seeing me, said, They s rahm for boath ye un yer pride, now, I sud think i the hahse.",
      "It s empty; ye may hev it all to yerseln, un Him as allas maks a third, i sich ill company!",
      "Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.",
      "My slumber was deep and sweet, though over far too soon.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing there?",
      "I told him the cause of my staying up so late that he had the key of our room in his pocket.",
      "The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.",
      "He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he d but I ll not repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!",
      "I sometimes wonder at him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he wakens.",
      "He told me of Catherine s illness, and accused my brother of causing it; promising that I should be Edgar s proxy in suffering, till he could get hold of him.",
      "I do hate him I am wretched I have been a fool!",
      "Beware of uttering one breath of this to any one at the Grange.",
      "I shall expect you every day don t disappoint me!",
      "ISABELLA.",
      "CHAPTER XIV As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton s situation, and her ardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.",
      "Forgiveness!",
      "said Linton.",
      "I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.",
      "You may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I am not _angry_, but I m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can never think she ll be happy.",
      "It is out of the question my going to see her, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.",
      "And you won t write her a little note, sir?",
      "I asked, imploringly.",
      "No, he answered.",
      "It is needless.",
      "My communication with Heathcliff s family shall be as sparing as his with mine.",
      "It shall not exist!",
      "Mr. Edgar s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console Isabella.",
      "I daresay she had been on the watch for me since morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being observed.",
      "I entered without knocking.",
      "There never was such a dreary, dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented!",
      "I must confess, that if I had been in the young lady s place, I would, at least, have swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster.",
      "But she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.",
      "Her pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head.",
      "Probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening.",
      "Hindley was not there.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly, and offered me a chair.",
      "He was the only thing there that seemed decent; and I thought he never looked better.",
      "So much had circumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a thorough little slattern!",
      "She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected letter.",
      "I shook my head.",
      "She wouldn t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I had brought.",
      "Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her man uvres, and said If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have, Nelly), give it to her.",
      "You needn t make a secret of it: we have no secrets between us.",
      "Oh, I have nothing, I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at once.",
      "My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present.",
      "He sends his love, ma am, and his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of keeping it up.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in the window.",
      "Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and began to put questions concerning Catherine.",
      "I told him as much as I thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.",
      "I blamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton s example and avoid future interference with his family, for good or evil.",
      "Mrs. Linton is now just recovering, I said; she ll never be like she was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her, you ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you ll move out of this country entirely; and that you may not regret it, I ll inform you Catherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as that young lady is different from me.",
      "Her appearance is changed greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense of duty!",
      "That is quite possible, remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem calm: quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.",
      "But do you imagine that I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_?",
      "and can you compare my feelings respecting Catherine to his?",
      "Before you leave this house, I must exact a promise from you that you ll get me an interview with her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!",
      "What do you say?",
      "I say, Mr. Heathcliff, I replied, you must not: you never shall, through my means.",
      "Another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether.",
      "With your aid that may be avoided, he continued; and should there be danger of such an event should he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her existence why, I think I shall be justified in going to extremes!",
      "I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would restrains me.",
      "And there you see the distinction between our feelings: had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against him.",
      "You may look incredulous, if you please!",
      "I never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his.",
      "The moment her regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!",
      "But, till then if you don t believe me, you don t know me till then, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!",
      "And yet, I interrupted, you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress.",
      "You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?",
      "you know she has not!",
      "You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends on Linton she spends a thousand on me!",
      "At a most miserable period of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again.",
      "And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.",
      "Two words would comprehend my future _death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.",
      "Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton s attachment more than mine.",
      "If he loved with all the powers of his puny being, he couldn t love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.",
      "And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by him.",
      "Tush!",
      "He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her horse.",
      "It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him what he has not?",
      "Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be, cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.",
      "No one has a right to talk in that manner, and I won t hear my brother depreciated in silence!",
      "Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn t he?",
      "observed Heathcliff, scornfully.",
      "He turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity.",
      "He is not aware of what I suffer, she replied.",
      "I didn t tell him that.",
      "You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?",
      "To say that I was married, I did write you saw the note.",
      "And nothing since?",
      "No.",
      "My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition, I remarked.",
      "Somebody s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn t say.",
      "I should guess it was her own, said Heathcliff.",
      "She degenerates into a mere slut!",
      "She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.",
      "You d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home.",
      "However, she ll suit this house so much the better for not being over nice, and I ll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad.",
      "Well, sir, returned I, I hope you ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been brought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.",
      "You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must treat her kindly.",
      "Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn t have abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.",
      "She abandoned them under a delusion, he answered; picturing in me a hero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion.",
      "I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature, so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished.",
      "But, at last, I think she begins to know me: I don t perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself.",
      "It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her.",
      "I believed, at one time, no lessons could teach her that!",
      "And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she announced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me!",
      "A positive labour of Hercules, I assure you!",
      "If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.",
      "Can I trust your assertion, Isabella?",
      "Are you sure you hate me?",
      "If I let you alone for half a day, won t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?",
      "I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed.",
      "But I don t care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.",
      "She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.",
      "The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for herself.",
      "But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!",
      "Now, was it not the depth of absurdity of genuine idiocy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?",
      "Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.",
      "She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I ve sometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back!",
      "But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the law.",
      "I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation; and, what s more, she d thank nobody for dividing us.",
      "If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, said I, this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she ll doubtless avail herself of the permission.",
      "You are not so bewitched, ma am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?",
      "Take care, Ellen!",
      "answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner s endeavours to make himself detested.",
      "Don t put faith in a single word he speaks.",
      "He s a lying fiend!",
      "a monster, and not a human being!",
      "I ve been told I might leave him before; and I ve made the attempt, but I dare not repeat it!",
      "Only, Ellen, promise you ll not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or Catherine.",
      "Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha n t obtain it I ll die first!",
      "I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me!",
      "The single pleasure I can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!",
      "There that will do for the present!",
      "said Heathcliff.",
      "If you are called upon in a court of law, you ll remember her language, Nelly!",
      "And take a good look at that countenance: she s near the point which would suit me.",
      "No; you re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and I, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however distasteful the obligation may be.",
      "Go upstairs; I have something to say to Ellen Dean in private.",
      "That s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!",
      "Why, this is the road upstairs, child!",
      "He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering I have no pity!",
      "I have no pity!",
      "The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails!",
      "It is a moral teething; and I grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.",
      "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
      "I said, hastening to resume my bonnet.",
      "Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?",
      "Put that down!",
      "he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.",
      "You are not going yet.",
      "Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and that without delay.",
      "I swear that I meditate no harm: I don t desire to cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if anything that I could do would be of use to her.",
      "Last night I was in the Grange garden six hours, and I ll return there to-night; and every night I ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of entering.",
      "If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay.",
      "If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.",
      "But wouldn t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their master?",
      "And you could do it so easily.",
      "I d warn you when I came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering mischief.",
      "I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer s house: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs. Linton s tranquillity for his satisfaction.",
      "The commonest occurrence startles her painfully, I said.",
      "She s all nerves, and she couldn t bear the surprise, I m positive.",
      "Don t persist, sir!",
      "or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs; and he ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!",
      "In that case I ll take measures to secure you, woman!",
      "exclaimed Heathcliff; you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow morning.",
      "It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear to see me; and as to surprising her, I don t desire it: you must prepare her ask her if I may come.",
      "You say she never mentions my name, and that I am never mentioned to her.",
      "To whom should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the house?",
      "She thinks you are all spies for her husband.",
      "Oh, I ve no doubt she s in hell among you!",
      "I guess by her silence, as much as anything, what she feels.",
      "You say she is often restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?",
      "You talk of her mind being unsettled.",
      "How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation?",
      "And that insipid, paltry creature attending her from _duty_ and _humanity_!",
      "From _pity_ and _charity_!",
      "He might as well plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares!",
      "Let us settle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over Linton and his footman?",
      "Or will you be my friend, as you have been hitherto, and do what I request?",
      "Decide!",
      "because there is no reason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!",
      "Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.",
      "I engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton s next absence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.",
      "Was it right or wrong?",
      "I fear it was wrong, though expedient.",
      "I thought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine s mental illness: and then I remembered Mr. Edgar s stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation, should be the last.",
      "Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton s hand.",
      "But here is Kenneth; I ll go down, and tell him how much better you are.",
      "My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another morning.",
      "* * * * * Dree, and dreary!",
      "I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse me.",
      "But never mind!",
      "I ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in Catherine Heathcliff s brilliant eyes.",
      "I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.",
      "CHAPTER XV Another week over and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!",
      "I have now heard all my neighbour s history, at different sittings, as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.",
      "I ll continue it in her own words, only a little condensed.",
      "She is, on the whole, a very fair narrator, and I don t think I could improve her style.",
      "* * * * * In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and didn t want to be threatened or teased any more.",
      "I had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine.",
      "The consequence was, that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days.",
      "The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.",
      "There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.",
      "He departed, and I went upstairs.",
      "Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.",
      "Her thick, long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.",
      "Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.",
      "The flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond you would have said out of this world.",
      "Then, the paleness of her face its haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered flesh and the peculiar expression arising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to the touching interest which she awakened; and invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should think refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.",
      "A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals.",
      "I believe Linton had laid it there: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or occupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement.",
      "She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses.",
      "At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.",
      "Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.",
      "It was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.",
      "At Wuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain.",
      "And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye.",
      "There s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton, I said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee.",
      "You must read it immediately, because it wants an answer.",
      "Shall I break the seal?",
      "Yes, she answered, without altering the direction of her eyes.",
      "I opened it it was very short.",
      "Now, I continued, read it.",
      "She drew away her hand, and let it fall.",
      "I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at last I resumed Must I read it, ma am?",
      "It is from Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to arrange her ideas.",
      "She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness.",
      "Well, he wishes to see you, said I, guessing her need of an interpreter.",
      "He s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know what answer I shall bring.",
      "As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a stranger.",
      "Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.",
      "The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own audacity.",
      "With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber.",
      "He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.",
      "He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!",
      "The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there she was fated, sure to die.",
      "Oh, Cathy!",
      "Oh, my life!",
      "how can I bear it?",
      "was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.",
      "And now he stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did not melt.",
      "What now?",
      "said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices.",
      "You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!",
      "And you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied!",
      "I shall not pity you, not I.",
      "You have killed me and thriven on it, I think.",
      "How strong you are!",
      "How many years do you mean to live after I am gone?",
      "Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down.",
      "I wish I could hold you, she continued, bitterly, till we were both dead!",
      "I shouldn t care what you suffered.",
      "I care nothing for your sufferings.",
      "Why shouldn t you suffer?",
      "I do!",
      "Will you forget me?",
      "Will you be happy when I am in the earth?",
      "Will you say twenty years hence, That s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?",
      "I loved her long ago, and was wretched to lose her; but it is past.",
      "I ve loved many others since: my children are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not rejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave them!",
      "Will you say so, Heathcliff?",
      "Don t torture me till I m as mad as yourself, cried he, wrenching his head free, and grinding his teeth.",
      "The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.",
      "Well might Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.",
      "Her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping.",
      "As to her companion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.",
      "Are you possessed with a devil, he pursued, savagely, to talk in that manner to me when you are dying?",
      "Do you reflect that all those words will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have left me?",
      "You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence!",
      "Is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?",
      "I shall not be at peace, moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.",
      "She said nothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more kindly I m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.",
      "I only wish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you hereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own sake, forgive me!",
      "Come here and kneel down again!",
      "You never harmed me in your life.",
      "Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember than my harsh words!",
      "Won t you come here again?",
      "Do!",
      "Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.",
      "She bent round to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.",
      "Mrs. Linton s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new sentiment in her.",
      "After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment: Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave.",
      "_That_ is how I m loved!",
      "Well, never mind.",
      "That is not _my_ Heathcliff.",
      "I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he s in my soul.",
      "And, added she musingly, the thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all.",
      "I m tired of being enclosed here.",
      "I m wearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.",
      "Nelly, you think you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are sorry for me very soon that will be altered.",
      "I shall be sorry for _you_.",
      "I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.",
      "I _wonder_ he won t be near me!",
      "She went on to herself.",
      "I thought he wished it.",
      "Heathcliff, dear!",
      "you should not be sullen now.",
      "Do come to me, Heathcliff.",
      "In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.",
      "At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate.",
      "His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast heaved convulsively.",
      "An instant they held asunder, and then how they met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible.",
      "He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.",
      "I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.",
      "A movement of Catherine s relieved me a little presently: she put up her hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly You teach me now how cruel you ve been cruel and false.",
      "_Why_ did you despise me?",
      "_Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy?",
      "I have not one word of comfort.",
      "You deserve this.",
      "You have killed yourself.",
      "Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they ll blight you they ll damn you.",
      "You loved me then what _right_ had you to leave me?",
      "What right answer me for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?",
      "Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it.",
      "I have not broken your heart _you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine.",
      "So much the worse for me that I am strong.",
      "Do I want to live?",
      "What kind of living will it be when you oh, God!",
      "would _you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?",
      "Let me alone.",
      "Let me alone, sobbed Catherine.",
      "If I ve done wrong, I m dying for it.",
      "It is enough!",
      "You left me too: but I won t upbraid you!",
      "I forgive you.",
      "Forgive me!",
      "It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands, he answered.",
      "Kiss me again; and don t let me see your eyes!",
      "I forgive what you have done to me.",
      "I love _my_ murderer but _yours_!",
      "How can I?",
      "They were silent their faces hid against each other, and washed by each other s tears.",
      "At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.",
      "I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away, the man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could distinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse thickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.",
      "Service is over, I announced.",
      "My master will be here in half an hour.",
      "Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never moved.",
      "Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing.",
      "Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer.",
      "Now he is here, I exclaimed.",
      "For heaven s sake, hurry down!",
      "You ll not meet any one on the front stairs.",
      "Do be quick; and stay among the trees till he is fairly in.",
      "I must go, Cathy, said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from his companion s arms.",
      "But if I live, I ll see you again before you are asleep.",
      "I won t stray five yards from your window.",
      "she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength allowed.",
      "You _shall_ not, I tell you.",
      "For one hour, he pleaded earnestly.",
      "Not for one minute, she replied.",
      "I _must_ Linton will be up immediately, persisted the alarmed intruder.",
      "He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act she clung fast, gasping: there was mad resolution in her face.",
      "she shrieked.",
      "Oh, don t, don t go.",
      "It is the last time!",
      "Edgar will not hurt us.",
      "Heathcliff, I shall die!",
      "I shall die!",
      "Damn the fool!",
      "There he is, cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his seat.",
      "Hush, my darling!",
      "Hush, hush, Catherine!",
      "I ll stay.",
      "If he shot me so, I d expire with a blessing on my lips.",
      "And there they were fast again.",
      "I heard my master mounting the stairs the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.",
      "Are you going to listen to her ravings?",
      "I said, passionately.",
      "She does not know what she says.",
      "Will you ruin her, because she has not wit to help herself?",
      "Get up!",
      "You could be free instantly.",
      "That is the most diabolical deed that ever you did.",
      "We are all done for master, mistress, and servant.",
      "I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise.",
      "In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe that Catherine s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.",
      "She s fainted, or dead, I thought: so much the better.",
      "Far better that she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to all about her.",
      "Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.",
      "What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all demonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his arms.",
      "Look there!",
      "Unless you be a fiend, help her first then you shall speak to me!",
      "He walked into the parlour, and sat down.",
      "Mr. Linton summoned me, and with great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to restore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and moaned, and knew nobody.",
      "Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated friend.",
      "I did not.",
      "I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.",
      "I shall not refuse to go out of doors, he answered; but I shall stay in the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.",
      "I shall be under those larch-trees.",
      "Mind!",
      "or I pay another visit, whether Linton be in or not.",
      "He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and, ascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house of his luckless presence.",
      "CHAPTER XVI About twelve o clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months child; and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar.",
      "The latter s distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.",
      "A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left without an heir.",
      "I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son s. An unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!",
      "It might have wailed out of life, and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.",
      "We redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be.",
      "Next morning bright and cheerful out of doors stole softened in through the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow, tender glow.",
      "Edgar Linton had his head laid on the pillow, and his eyes shut.",
      "His young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.",
      "Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.",
      "And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.",
      "I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before: Incomparably beyond and above us all!",
      "Whether still on earth or now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!",
      "I don t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me.",
      "I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter the Eternity they have entered where life is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its fulness.",
      "I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like Mr. Linton s, when he so regretted Catherine s blessed release!",
      "To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at last.",
      "One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in the presence of her corpse.",
      "It asserted its own tranquillity, which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.",
      "Do you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir?",
      "I d give a great deal to know.",
      "I declined answering Mrs. Dean s question, which struck me as something heterodox.",
      "She proceeded: Retracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to think she is; but we ll leave her with her Maker.",
      "The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.",
      "The servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "If he had remained among the larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to Gimmerton.",
      "If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer doors, that all was not right within.",
      "I wished, yet feared, to find him.",
      "I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but _how_ to do it I did not know.",
      "He was there at least, a few yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell pattering round him.",
      "He had been standing a long time in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber.",
      "They flew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke: She s dead!",
      "he said; I ve not waited for you to learn that.",
      "Put your handkerchief away don t snivel before me.",
      "Damn you all!",
      "she wants none of _your_ tears!",
      "I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.",
      "When I first looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground.",
      "Yes, she s dead!",
      "I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.",
      "Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!",
      "Did _she_ take due warning, then?",
      "asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.",
      "Did she die like a saint?",
      "Come, give me a true history of the event.",
      "How did ?",
      "He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony, defying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.",
      "How did she die?",
      "he resumed, at last fain, notwithstanding his hardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he trembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.",
      "Poor wretch!",
      "I thought; you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men!",
      "Why should you be anxious to conceal them?",
      "Your pride cannot blind God!",
      "You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of humiliation.",
      "Quietly as a lamb!",
      "I answered, aloud.",
      "She drew a sigh, and stretched herself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five minutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!",
      "And did she ever mention me?",
      "he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear.",
      "Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left her, I said.",
      "She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.",
      "Her life closed in a gentle dream may she wake as kindly in the other world!",
      "May she wake in torment!",
      "he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping his foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.",
      "Why, she s a liar to the end!",
      "Not _there_ not in heaven not perished where?",
      "you said you cared nothing for my sufferings!",
      "And I pray one prayer I repeat it till my tongue stiffens Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living; you said I killed you haunt me, then!",
      "The murdered _do_ haunt their murderers, I believe.",
      "I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth.",
      "Be with me always take any form drive me mad!",
      "only _do_ not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you!",
      "Oh, God!",
      "it is unutterable!",
      "I _cannot_ live without my life!",
      "I _cannot_ live without my soul!",
      "He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death with knives and spears.",
      "I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably the scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.",
      "It hardly moved my compassion it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to quit him so.",
      "But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.",
      "He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!",
      "Mrs. Linton s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.",
      "Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and a circumstance concealed from all but me Heathcliff spent his nights, at least, outside, equally a stranger to repose.",
      "I held no communication with him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu.",
      "He did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.",
      "Indeed, I shouldn t have discovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse s face, and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine s neck.",
      "Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own.",
      "I twisted the two, and enclosed them together.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.",
      "Isabella was not asked.",
      "The place of Catherine s interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet by the tombs of her own relations, outside.",
      "It was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost buries it.",
      "Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the graves.",
      "CHAPTER XVII That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.",
      "In the evening the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought rain first, and then sleet and snow.",
      "On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.",
      "And dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!",
      "My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person entered, out of breath and laughing!",
      "My anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute.",
      "I supposed it one of the maids, and I cried Have done!",
      "How dare you show your giddiness here?",
      "What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?",
      "Excuse me!",
      "answered a familiar voice; but I know Edgar is in bed, and I cannot stop myself.",
      "With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her hand to her side.",
      "I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!",
      "she continued, after a pause; except where I ve flown.",
      "I couldn t count the number of falls I ve had.",
      "Oh, I m aching all over!",
      "Don t be alarmed!",
      "There shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.",
      "The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.",
      "She certainly seemed in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck.",
      "The frock was of light silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.",
      "My dear young lady, I exclaimed, I ll stir nowhere, and hear nothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is needless to order the carriage.",
      "Certainly I shall, she said; walking or riding: yet I ve no objection to dress myself decently.",
      "And ah, see how it flows down my neck now!",
      "The fire does make it smart.",
      "She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me touch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.",
      "Now, Ellen, she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, you sit down opposite me, and put poor Catherine s baby away: I don t like to see it!",
      "You mustn t think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so foolishly on entering: I ve cried, too, bitterly yes, more than any one else has reason to cry.",
      "We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I sha n t forgive myself.",
      "But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise with him the brute beast!",
      "Oh, give me the poker!",
      "This is the last thing of his I have about me: she slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor.",
      "I ll smash it!",
      "she continued, striking it with childish spite, and then I ll burn it!",
      "and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.",
      "he shall buy another, if he gets me back again.",
      "He d be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar.",
      "I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head!",
      "And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?",
      "And I won t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble.",
      "Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I d have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that incarnate goblin!",
      "Ah, he was in such a fury!",
      "If he had caught me!",
      "It s a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn t have run till I d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!",
      "Well, don t talk so fast, Miss!",
      "I interrupted; you ll disorder the handkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.",
      "Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is sadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!",
      "An undeniable truth, she replied.",
      "Listen to that child!",
      "It maintains a constant wail send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha n t stay any longer.",
      "I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant s care; and then I inquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an unlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with us.",
      "I ought, and I wished to remain, answered she, to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right home.",
      "But I tell you he wouldn t let me!",
      "Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry could bear to think that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort?",
      "Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion.",
      "It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away.",
      "I ve recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I d rather he d kill himself!",
      "He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I m at my ease.",
      "I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if no, no!",
      "Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow.",
      "Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well.",
      "Monster!",
      "would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!",
      "He s a human being, I said.",
      "Be more charitable: there are worse men than he is yet!",
      "He s not a human being, she retorted; and he has no claim on my charity.",
      "I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to me.",
      "People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine!",
      "No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn t!",
      "And here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced.",
      "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
      "I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.",
      "Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head.",
      "He was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence.",
      "I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.",
      "Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral.",
      "He kept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six o clock and getting up drunk at twelve.",
      "Consequently, he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.",
      "Heathcliff I shudder to name him!",
      "has been a stranger in the house from last Sunday till to-day.",
      "Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.",
      "He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his chamber; locking himself in as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company!",
      "There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father!",
      "After concluding these precious orisons and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat he would be off again; always straight down to the Grange!",
      "I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him into custody!",
      "For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.",
      "I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph s eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly.",
      "You wouldn t think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions.",
      "I d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with t little maister and his staunch supporter, that odious old man!",
      "When Heathcliff is in, I m often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements.",
      "He is quieter now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less furious.",
      "Joseph affirms he s sure he s an altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved so as by fire.",
      "I m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.",
      "Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve.",
      "It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new-made grave!",
      "I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.",
      "Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same subject.",
      "He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours.",
      "There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.",
      "Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed.",
      "It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be restored.",
      "The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm.",
      "That entrance was fastened, and we heard him coming round to get in by the other.",
      "I rose with an irrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.",
      "I ll keep him out five minutes, he exclaimed.",
      "You won t object?",
      "No, you may keep him out the whole night for me, I answered.",
      "put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.",
      "Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.",
      "You, and I, he said, have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder!",
      "If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to discharge it.",
      "Are you as soft as your brother?",
      "Are you willing to endure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
      "I m weary of enduring now, I replied; and I d be glad of a retaliation that wouldn t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies.",
      "Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!",
      "cried Hindley.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, I ll ask you to do nothing; but sit still and be dumb.",
      "Tell me now, can you?",
      "I m sure you would have as much pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend s existence; he ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he ll be _my_ ruin.",
      "Damn the hellish villain!",
      "He knocks at the door as if he were master here already!",
      "Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock strikes it wants three minutes of one you re a free woman!",
      "He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his breast, and would have turned down the candle.",
      "I snatched it away, however, and seized his arm.",
      "I ll not hold my tongue!",
      "I said; you mustn t touch him.",
      "Let the door remain shut, and be quiet!",
      "I ve formed my resolution, and by God I ll execute it!",
      "cried the desperate being.",
      "I ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and Hareton justice!",
      "And you needn t trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone.",
      "Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I cut my throat this minute and it s time to make an end!",
      "I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic.",
      "The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him.",
      "You d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!",
      "I exclaimed, in rather a triumphant tone.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you persist in endeavouring to enter.",
      "You d better open the door, you he answered, addressing me by some elegant term that I don t care to repeat.",
      "I shall not meddle in the matter, I retorted again.",
      "Come in and get shot, if you please.",
      "I ve done my duty.",
      "With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him.",
      "Earnshaw swore passionately at me: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced.",
      "And I, in my secret heart (and conscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing for _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode!",
      "As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly through.",
      "The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security.",
      "His hair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.",
      "Isabella, let me in, or I ll make you repent!",
      "he girned, as Joseph calls it.",
      "I cannot commit murder, I replied.",
      "Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol.",
      "Let me in by the kitchen door, he said.",
      "Hindley will be there before me, I answered: and that s a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow!",
      "We were left at peace in our beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter returns, you must run for shelter!",
      "Heathcliff, if I were you, I d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog.",
      "The world is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
      "You had distinctly impressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.",
      "He s there, is he?",
      "exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap.",
      "If I can get my arm out I can hit him!",
      "I m afraid, Ellen, you ll set me down as really wicked; but you don t know all, so don t judge.",
      "I wouldn t have aided or abetted an attempt on even _his_ life for anything.",
      "Wish that he were dead, I must; and therefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw s weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.",
      "The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its owner s wrist.",
      "Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the flesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket.",
      "He then took a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang in.",
      "His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein.",
      "The ruffian kicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph.",
      "He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.",
      "There he tore off the sleeve of Earnshaw s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before.",
      "Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.",
      "What is ther to do, now?",
      "There s this to do, thundered Heathcliff, that your master s mad; and should he last another month, I ll have him to an asylum.",
      "And how the devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
      "Don t stand muttering and mumbling there.",
      "Come, I m not going to nurse him.",
      "Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle it is more than half brandy!",
      "And so ye ve been murthering on him?",
      "exclaimed Joseph, lifting his hands and eyes in horror.",
      "If iver I seed a seeght loike this!",
      "May the Lord Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood, and flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he joined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology.",
      "I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows.",
      "Oh, I forgot you, said the tyrant.",
      "You shall do that.",
      "Down with you.",
      "And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?",
      "There, that is work fit for you!",
      "He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who steadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set off for the Grange directly.",
      "Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.",
      "He was so obstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions.",
      "It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung replies.",
      "However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness.",
      "Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to get to bed.",
      "To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.",
      "I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.",
      "This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr. Earnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.",
      "Neither appeared inclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced alone.",
      "Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me.",
      "After I had done, I ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw s seat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.",
      "Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.",
      "His forehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so diabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness.",
      "Had it been another, I would have covered my face in the presence of such grief.",
      "In _his_ case, I was gratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.",
      "Fie, fie, Miss!",
      "One might suppose you had never opened a Bible in your life.",
      "If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to suffice you.",
      "It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his!",
      "In general I ll allow that it would be, Ellen, she continued; but what misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?",
      "I d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings and he might _know_ that I was the cause.",
      "Oh, I owe him so much.",
      "On only one condition can I hope to forgive him.",
      "It is, if I may take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench: reduce him to my level.",
      "As he was the first to injure, make him the first to implore pardon; and then why then, Ellen, I might show you some generosity.",
      "But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and therefore I cannot forgive him.",
      "Hindley wanted some water, and I handed him a glass, and asked him how he was.",
      "Not as ill as I wish, he replied.",
      "But leaving out my arm, every inch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!",
      "Yes, no wonder, was my next remark.",
      "Catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her.",
      "It s well people don t _really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a repulsive scene!",
      "Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and shoulders?",
      "I can t say, he answered; but what do you mean?",
      "Did he dare to strike me when I was down?",
      "He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground, I whispered.",
      "And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because he s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe; who, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him: the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.",
      "Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony, I d go to hell with joy, groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle.",
      "Nay, it s enough that he has murdered one of you, I observed aloud.",
      "At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "After all, it is preferable to be hated than loved by him.",
      "When I recollect how happy we were how happy Catherine was before he came I m fit to curse the day.",
      "Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it.",
      "His attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs.",
      "I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.",
      "The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.",
      "Get up, and begone out of my sight, said the mourner.",
      "I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly intelligible.",
      "I beg your pardon, I replied.",
      "But I loved Catherine too; and her brother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.",
      "Now that she s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and her Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!",
      "he cried, making a movement that caused me to make one also.",
      "But then, I continued, holding myself ready to flee, if poor Catherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible, degrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a similar picture!",
      "_She_ wouldn t have borne your abominable behaviour quietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.",
      "The back of the settle and Earnshaw s person interposed between me and him; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the table and flung it at my head.",
      "It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his missile.",
      "The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth.",
      "In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon-light of the Grange.",
      "And far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.",
      "Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar s and Catherine s portraits, bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.",
      "She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled.",
      "I believe her new abode was in the south, near London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.",
      "He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish creature.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived.",
      "I refused to tell.",
      "He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her himself.",
      "Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child.",
      "Still, he didn t molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.",
      "He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed: They wish me to hate it too, do they?",
      "I don t think they wish you to know anything about it, I answered.",
      "But I ll have it, he said, when I want it.",
      "They may reckon on that!",
      "Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.",
      "On the day succeeding Isabella s unexpected visit I had no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing nothing.",
      "When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.",
      "So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.",
      "Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers were abroad.",
      "But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long.",
      "_He_ didn t pray for Catherine s soul to haunt him.",
      "Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.",
      "He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was gone.",
      "And he had earthly consolation and affections also.",
      "For a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot s sceptre in his heart.",
      "It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.",
      "The little one was always Cathy: it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than from its being his own.",
      "I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances.",
      "They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn t both have taken the same road, for good or evil.",
      "But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man.",
      "When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.",
      "Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him.",
      "One hoped, and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.",
      "But you ll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you ll judge, as well as I can, all these things: at least, you ll think you will, and that s the same.",
      "The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his sister s: there were scarcely six months between them.",
      "We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral.",
      "Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to my master.",
      "Well, Nelly, said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, it s yours and my turn to go into mourning at present.",
      "Who s given us the slip now, do you think?",
      "I asked in a flurry.",
      "Why, guess!",
      "he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door.",
      "And nip up the corner of your apron: I m certain you ll need it.",
      "Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?",
      "would you have tears for him?",
      "said the doctor.",
      "No, Heathcliff s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day.",
      "I ve just seen him.",
      "He s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.",
      "Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?",
      "I repeated impatiently.",
      "Hindley Earnshaw!",
      "Your old friend Hindley, he replied, and my wicked gossip: though he s been too wild for me this long while.",
      "I said we should draw water.",
      "But cheer up!",
      "He died true to his character: drunk as a lord.",
      "Poor lad!",
      "I m sorry, too.",
      "One can t help missing an old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.",
      "He s barely twenty-seven, it seems; that s your own age: who would have thought you were born in one year?",
      "I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton s death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master.",
      "I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question Had he had fair play?",
      "Whatever I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the dead.",
      "Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own.",
      "Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife s nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law.",
      "He was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.",
      "His lawyer had been Earnshaw s also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me.",
      "He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.",
      "His father died in debt, he said; the whole property is mortgaged, and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor s heart, that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.",
      "When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress, expressed satisfaction at my presence.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff said he did not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral, if I chose.",
      "Correctly, he remarked, that fool s body should be buried at the cross-roads, without ceremony of any kind.",
      "I happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately!",
      "We broke in this morning, for we heard him snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle: flaying and scalping would not have wakened him.",
      "I sent for Kenneth, and he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both dead and cold, and stark; and so you ll allow it was useless making more stir about him!",
      "The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered: I d rayther he d goan hisseln for t doctor!",
      "I sud ha taen tent o t maister better nor him and he warn t deead when I left, naught o t soart!",
      "I insisted on the funeral being respectable.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket.",
      "He maintained a hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed.",
      "I observed once, indeed, something like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house.",
      "He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, Now, my bonny lad, you are _mine_!",
      "And we ll see if one tree won t grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!",
      "The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech: he played with Heathcliff s whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.",
      "There is nothing in the world less yours than he is!",
      "Does Linton say so?",
      "he demanded.",
      "Of course he has ordered me to take him, I replied.",
      "Well, said the scoundrel, we ll not argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove it.",
      "I don t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I ll be pretty sure to make the other come!",
      "Remember to tell him.",
      "This hint was enough to bind our hands.",
      "I repeated its substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering.",
      "I m not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been ever so willing.",
      "The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm possession, and proved to the attorney who, in his turn, proved it to Mr. Linton that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee.",
      "In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.",
      "CHAPTER XVIII The twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady s trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in common with all children, rich and poor.",
      "For the rest, after the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton s dust.",
      "She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons fair skin and small features, and yellow curling hair.",
      "Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections.",
      "That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.",
      "However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts.",
      "A propensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross.",
      "If a servant chanced to vex her, it was always I shall tell papa!",
      "And if he reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don t believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her.",
      "He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an amusement.",
      "Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his teaching.",
      "Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself.",
      "Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.",
      "Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only building she had approached or entered, except her own home.",
      "Wuthering Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, while surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?",
      "I wonder what lies on the other side is it the sea?",
      "No, Miss Cathy, I would answer; it is hills again, just like these.",
      "And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?",
      "she once asked.",
      "The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.",
      "I explained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.",
      "And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?",
      "she pursued.",
      "Because they are a great deal higher up than we are, replied I; you could not climb them, they are too high and steep.",
      "In winter the frost is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!",
      "Oh, you have been on them!",
      "she cried gleefully.",
      "Then I can go, too, when I am a woman.",
      "Has papa been, Ellen?",
      "Papa would tell you, Miss, I answered, hastily, that they are not worth the trouble of visiting.",
      "The moors, where you ramble with him, are much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.",
      "But I know the park, and I don t know those, she murmured to herself.",
      "And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.",
      "One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he promised she should have the journey when she got older.",
      "But Miss Catherine measured her age by months, and, Now, am I old enough to go to Penistone Crags?",
      "was the constant question in her mouth.",
      "The road thither wound close by Wuthering Heights.",
      "Edgar had not the heart to pass it; so she received as constantly the answer, Not yet, love: not yet.",
      "I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband.",
      "Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.",
      "What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close.",
      "She wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months indisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands.",
      "Her hope was that Linton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education.",
      "My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.",
      "He was away three weeks.",
      "The first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might entertain herself.",
      "I used to send her on her travels round the grounds now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.",
      "The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales.",
      "I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were generally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone, if they had stood wide open.",
      "Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.",
      "Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o clock, and said she was that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.",
      "I got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come back early.",
      "The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.",
      "One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her myself.",
      "There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds.",
      "I inquired of him if he had seen our young lady.",
      "I saw her at morn, he replied: she would have me to cut her a hazel switch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it is lowest, and galloped out of sight.",
      "You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.",
      "It struck me directly she must have started for Penistone Crags.",
      "What will become of her?",
      "I ejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making straight to the high-road.",
      "I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I detect, far or near.",
      "The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr. Heathcliff s place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them.",
      "And what if she should have slipped in clambering among them, I reflected, and been killed, or broken some of her bones?",
      "My suspense was truly painful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear.",
      "I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance.",
      "A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.",
      "Ah, said she, you are come a-seeking your little mistress!",
      "Don t be frightened.",
      "She s here safe: but I m glad it isn t the master.",
      "He is not at home then, is he?",
      "I panted, quite breathless with quick walking and alarm.",
      "No, no, she replied: both he and Joseph are off, and I think they won t return this hour or more.",
      "Step in and rest you a bit.",
      "I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself in a little chair that had been her mother s when a child.",
      "Her hat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton now a great, strong lad of eighteen who stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.",
      "Very well, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry countenance.",
      "This is your last ride, till papa comes back.",
      "I ll not trust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!",
      "Aha, Ellen!",
      "she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.",
      "I shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you ve found me out.",
      "Have you ever been here in your life before?",
      "Put that hat on, and home at once, said I. I m dreadfully grieved at you, Miss Cathy: you ve done extremely wrong!",
      "It s no use pouting and crying: that won t repay the trouble I ve had, scouring the country after you.",
      "To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing off so!",
      "It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith in you any more.",
      "What have I done?",
      "sobbed she, instantly checked.",
      "Papa charged me nothing: he ll not scold me, Ellen he s never cross, like you!",
      "Come, come!",
      "I repeated.",
      "I ll tie the riband.",
      "Now, let us have no petulance.",
      "Oh, for shame!",
      "You thirteen years old, and such a baby!",
      "This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and retreating to the chimney out of my reach.",
      "Nay, said the servant, don t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.",
      "We made her stop: she d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be uneasy.",
      "Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it s a wild road over the hills.",
      "Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.",
      "How long am I to wait?",
      "I continued, disregarding the woman s interference.",
      "It will be dark in ten minutes.",
      "Where is the pony, Miss Cathy?",
      "And where is Phoenix?",
      "I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so please yourself.",
      "The pony is in the yard, she replied, and Phoenix is shut in there.",
      "He s bitten and so is Charlie.",
      "I was going to tell you all about it; but you are in a bad temper, and don t deserve to hear.",
      "I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.",
      "Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation, Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware whose house this is you d be glad enough to get out.",
      "It s _your_ father s, isn t it?",
      "said she, turning to Hareton.",
      "Nay, he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.",
      "He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his own.",
      "Whose then your master s?",
      "He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and turned away.",
      "Who is his master?",
      "continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.",
      "He talked about our house, and our folk.",
      "I thought he had been the owner s son.",
      "And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn t he, if he s a servant?",
      "Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.",
      "I silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure.",
      "Now, get my horse, she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the stable-boys at the Grange.",
      "And you may come with me.",
      "I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!",
      "What s the matter?",
      "Get my horse, I say.",
      "I ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!",
      "growled the lad.",
      "You ll see me _what?_ asked Catherine in surprise.",
      "Damned thou saucy witch!",
      "he replied.",
      "There, Miss Cathy!",
      "you see you have got into pretty company, I interposed.",
      "Nice words to be used to a young lady!",
      "Pray don t begin to dispute with him.",
      "Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.",
      "But, Ellen, cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, how dare he speak so to me?",
      "Mustn t he be made to do as I ask him?",
      "You wicked creature, I shall tell papa what you said.",
      "Now, then!",
      "Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation.",
      "You bring the pony, she exclaimed, turning to the woman, and let my dog free this moment!",
      "Softly, Miss, answered the addressed.",
      "You ll lose nothing by being civil.",
      "Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master s son, he s your cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.",
      "_He_ my cousin!",
      "cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.",
      "Yes, indeed, responded her reprover.",
      "Oh, Ellen!",
      "don t let them say such things, she pursued in great trouble.",
      "Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a gentleman s son.",
      "That my she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown.",
      "I whispered; people can have many cousins and of all sorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.",
      "He s not he s not my cousin, Ellen!",
      "she went on, gathering fresh grief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea.",
      "I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations; having no doubt of Linton s approaching arrival, communicated by the former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that Catherine s first thought on her father s return would be to seek an explanation of the latter s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.",
      "Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist!",
      "for he meant nought.",
      "Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.",
      "I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features, and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game.",
      "Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.",
      "Good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a wealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff s judgment.",
      "He appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice.",
      "And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family.",
      "And as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offald ways, so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton s faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property.",
      "If the lad swore, he wouldn t correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.",
      "It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it.",
      "Hareton s blood would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought.",
      "Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations.",
      "I don t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little.",
      "The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley s time were not now enacted within its walls.",
      "The master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.",
      "This, however, is not making progress with my story.",
      "Miss Cathy rejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and Phoenix.",
      "They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.",
      "I could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton happened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train.",
      "They had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed an introduction.",
      "Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to accompany her.",
      "He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty other queer places.",
      "But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.",
      "I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff s housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin.",
      "Then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always love, and darling, and queen, and angel, with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger!",
      "She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.",
      "I explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn t bear that prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.",
      "After all, she was a sweet little girl.",
      "CHAPTER XIX A letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master s return.",
      "Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew.",
      "Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of her real cousin.",
      "The evening of their expected arrival came.",
      "Since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock poor thing!",
      "her aunt s death impressed her with no definite sorrow she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.",
      "Linton is just six months younger than I am, she chattered, as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under shadow of the trees.",
      "How delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow!",
      "Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was lighter than mine more flaxen, and quite as fine.",
      "I have it carefully preserved in a little glass box; and I ve often thought what a pleasure it would be to see its owner.",
      "I am happy and papa, dear, dear papa!",
      "Come, Ellen, let us run!",
      "come, run.",
      "She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she couldn t be still a minute.",
      "How long they are!",
      "Ah, I see some dust on the road they are coming!",
      "When will they be here?",
      "May we not go a little way half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?",
      "Do say yes, to that clump of birches at the turn!",
      "I refused staunchly.",
      "At length her suspense was ended: the travelling carriage rolled in sight.",
      "Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her father s face looking from the window.",
      "He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.",
      "While they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.",
      "He was asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been winter.",
      "A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for my master s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.",
      "The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.",
      "Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the servants.",
      "Now, darling, said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted at the bottom of the front steps: your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time since; therefore, don t expect him to play and run about with you directly.",
      "And don t harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this evening, at least, will you?",
      "Yes, yes, papa, answered Catherine: but I do want to see him; and he hasn t once looked out.",
      "The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the ground by his uncle.",
      "This is your cousin Cathy, Linton, he said, putting their little hands together.",
      "She s fond of you already; and mind you don t grieve her by crying to-night.",
      "Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.",
      "Let me go to bed, then, answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine s salute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.",
      "Come, come, there s a good child, I whispered, leading him in.",
      "You ll make her weep too see how sorry she is for you!",
      "I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.",
      "All three entered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.",
      "I proceeded to remove Linton s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.",
      "My master inquired what was the matter.",
      "I can t sit on a chair, sobbed the boy.",
      "Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea, answered his uncle patiently.",
      "He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his fretful ailing charge.",
      "Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.",
      "Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.",
      "At first she sat silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer, like a baby.",
      "This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.",
      "Oh, he ll do very well, said the master to me, after watching them a minute.",
      "Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.",
      "The company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for strength he ll gain it.",
      "Ay, if we can keep him!",
      "I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that.",
      "And then, I thought, how ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?",
      "Between his father and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they ll be.",
      "Our doubts were presently decided even earlier than I expected.",
      "I had just taken the children upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep he would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case I had come down, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that Mr. Heathcliff s servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with the master.",
      "I shall ask him what he wants first, I said, in considerable trepidation.",
      "A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the instant they have returned from a long journey.",
      "I don t think the master can see him.",
      "Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now presented himself in the hall.",
      "He was donned in his Sunday garments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat.",
      "Good-evening, Joseph, I said, coldly.",
      "What business brings you here to-night?",
      "It s Maister Linton I mun spake to, he answered, waving me disdainfully aside.",
      "Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say, I m sure he won t hear it now, I continued.",
      "You had better sit down in there, and entrust your message to me.",
      "Which is his rahm?",
      "pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors.",
      "I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I went up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising that he should be dismissed till next day.",
      "Mr. Linton had no time to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn t goa back bout him.",
      "Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account; but, recalling Isabella s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be avoided.",
      "No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was nothing left but to resign him.",
      "However, he was not going to rouse him from his sleep.",
      "Tell Mr. Heathcliff, he answered calmly, that his son shall come to Wuthering Heights to-morrow.",
      "He is in bed, and too tired to go the distance now.",
      "You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired him to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very precarious.",
      "Noa!",
      "said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and assuming an authoritative air.",
      "that means naught.",
      "Hathecliff maks noa count o t mother, nor ye norther; but he ll hev his lad; und I mun tak him soa now ye knaw!",
      "You shall not to-night!",
      "answered Linton decisively.",
      "Walk down stairs at once, and repeat to your master what I have said.",
      "Ellen, show him down.",
      "Go And, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room of him and closed the door.",
      "Varrah weell!",
      "shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.",
      "To-morn, he s come hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!",
      "CHAPTER XX To obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton commissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine s pony; and, said he As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or bad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to visit the Heights.",
      "Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and he has been obliged to leave us.",
      "Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o clock, and astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late journey.",
      "My father!",
      "he cried, in strange perplexity.",
      "Mamma never told me I had a father.",
      "Where does he live?",
      "I d rather stay with uncle.",
      "He lives a little distance from the Grange, I replied; just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.",
      "And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.",
      "You must try to love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.",
      "But why have I not heard of him before?",
      "Why didn t mamma and he live together, as other people do?",
      "He had business to keep him in the north, I answered, and your mother s health required her to reside in the south.",
      "And why didn t mamma speak to me about him?",
      "persevered the child.",
      "She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.",
      "How am I to love papa?",
      "I don t know him.",
      "Oh, all children love their parents, I said.",
      "Your mother, perhaps, thought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.",
      "Let us make haste.",
      "An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much preferable to an hour s more sleep.",
      "Is _she_ to go with us, he demanded, the little girl I saw yesterday?",
      "Not now, replied I.",
      "Is uncle?",
      "he continued.",
      "No, I shall be your companion there, I said.",
      "Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.",
      "I won t go without uncle, he cried at length: I can t tell where you mean to take me.",
      "I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to call for my master s assistance in coaxing him out of bed.",
      "The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.",
      "The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while.",
      "He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.",
      "Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?",
      "he inquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light mist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.",
      "It is not so buried in trees, I replied, and it is not quite so large, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is healthier for you fresher and drier.",
      "You will, perhaps, think the building old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the next best in the neighbourhood.",
      "And you will have such nice rambles on the moors.",
      "Hareton Earnshaw that is, Miss Cathy s other cousin, and so yours in a manner will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and, now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently, walk out on the hills.",
      "And what is my father like?",
      "he asked.",
      "Is he as young and handsome as uncle?",
      "He s as young, said I; but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.",
      "He ll not seem to you so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still, mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he ll be fonder of you than any uncle, for you are his own.",
      "Black hair and eyes!",
      "mused Linton.",
      "I can t fancy him.",
      "Then I am not like him, am I?",
      "Not much, I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes his mother s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.",
      "How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!",
      "he murmured.",
      "Has he ever seen me?",
      "If he has, I must have been a baby.",
      "I remember not a single thing about him!",
      "Why, Master Linton, said I, three hundred miles is a great distance; and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared with what they do to you.",
      "It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now it is too late.",
      "Don t trouble him with questions on the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.",
      "The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.",
      "I watched to catch his impressions in his countenance.",
      "He surveyed the carved front and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.",
      "But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.",
      "Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.",
      "It was half-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and wiping down the table.",
      "Joseph stood by his master s chair telling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.",
      "Hallo, Nelly!",
      "said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.",
      "I feared I should have to come down and fetch my property myself.",
      "You ve brought it, have you?",
      "Let us see what we can make of it.",
      "He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping curiosity.",
      "Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.",
      "Sure-ly, said Joseph after a grave inspection, he s swopped wi ye, Maister, an yon s his lass!",
      "Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a scornful laugh.",
      "what a beauty!",
      "what a lovely, charming thing!",
      "Hav n t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?",
      "Oh, damn my soul!",
      "but that s worse than I expected and the devil knows I was not sanguine!",
      "I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.",
      "He did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father s speech, or whether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger was his father.",
      "But he clung to me with growing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff s taking a seat and bidding him come hither he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.",
      "Tut, tut!",
      "said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him roughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.",
      "None of that nonsense!",
      "We re not going to hurt thee, Linton isn t that thy name?",
      "Thou art thy mother s child, entirely!",
      "Where is _my_ share in thee, puling chicken?",
      "He took off the boy s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.",
      "Do you know me?",
      "asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the limbs were all equally frail and feeble.",
      "No, said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.",
      "You ve heard of me, I daresay?",
      "No, he replied again.",
      "What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for me!",
      "You are my son, then, I ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.",
      "Now, don t wince, and colour up!",
      "Though it _is_ something to see you have not white blood.",
      "Be a good lad; and I ll do for you.",
      "Nelly, if you be tired you may sit down; if not, get home again.",
      "I guess you ll report what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won t be settled while you linger about it.",
      "Well, replied I, I hope you ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or you ll not keep him long; and he s all you have akin in the wide world, that you will ever know remember.",
      "I ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn t fear, he said, laughing.",
      "Only nobody else must be kind to him: I m jealous of monopolising his affection.",
      "And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some breakfast.",
      "Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.",
      "Yes, Nell, he added, when they had departed, my son is prospective owner of your place, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his successor.",
      "Besides, he s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_ descendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children to till their fathers lands for wages.",
      "That is the sole consideration which can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate him for the memories he revives!",
      "But that consideration is sufficient: he s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master tends his own.",
      "I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome style; I ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from twenty miles distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.",
      "I ve ordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I ve arranged everything with a view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his associates.",
      "I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the trouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a worthy object of pride; and I m bitterly disappointed with the whey-faced, whining wretch!",
      "While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.",
      "I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master s scorn of the child; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.",
      "Cannot ate it?",
      "repeated he, peering in Linton s face, and subduing his voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.",
      "But Maister Hareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little un; and what wer gooid eneugh for him s gooid eneugh for ye, I s rayther think!",
      "I _sha n t_ eat it!",
      "answered Linton, snappishly.",
      "Take it away.",
      "Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.",
      "Is there aught ails th victuals?",
      "he asked, thrusting the tray under Heathcliff s nose.",
      "What should ail them?",
      "Wah!",
      "answered Joseph, yon dainty chap says he cannut ate em.",
      "But I guess it s raight!",
      "His mother wer just soa we wer a most too mucky to sow t corn for makking her breead.",
      "Don t mention his mother to me, said the master, angrily.",
      "Get him something that he can eat, that s all.",
      "What is his usual food, Nelly?",
      "I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions to prepare some.",
      "Come, I reflected, his father s selfishness may contribute to his comfort.",
      "He perceives his delicate constitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably.",
      "I ll console Mr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff s humour has taken.",
      "Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.",
      "But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words Don t leave me!",
      "I ll not stay here!",
      "Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come forth.",
      "I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief guardianship ended.",
      "CHAPTER XXI We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, if I can get him ; and there were no hopes of that.",
      "This promise poorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.",
      "When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen.",
      "I could gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome inmate.",
      "She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.",
      "There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.",
      "And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature, added the woman; nor one so careful of hisseln.",
      "He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the evening.",
      "it s killing, a breath of night air!",
      "And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph s bacca-pipe is poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there he ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him Hareton is not bad-natured, though he s rough they re sure to part, one swearing and the other crying.",
      "I believe the master would relish Earnshaw s thrashing him to a mummy, if he were not his son; and I m certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln.",
      "But then he won t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him upstairs directly.",
      "I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with us.",
      "Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?",
      "She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards.",
      "That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she lives there still.",
      "Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy reached sixteen.",
      "On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress s death.",
      "Her father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.",
      "Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.",
      "This twentieth of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.",
      "So make haste, Ellen!",
      "I know where I wish to go; where a colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made their nests yet.",
      "That must be a good distance up, I answered; they don t breed on the edge of the moor.",
      "No, it s not, she said.",
      "I ve gone very near with papa.",
      "I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.",
      "She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.",
      "She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.",
      "It s a pity she could not be content.",
      "Well, said I, where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?",
      "We should be at them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.",
      "Oh, a little further only a little further, Ellen, was her answer, continually.",
      "Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.",
      "But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our steps.",
      "I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow.",
      "Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.",
      "Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting out the nests of the grouse.",
      "The Heights were Heathcliff s land, and he was reproving the poacher.",
      "I ve neither taken any nor found any, she said, as I toiled to them, expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.",
      "I didn t mean to take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished to see the eggs.",
      "Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards it, and demanded who papa was?",
      "Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange, she replied.",
      "I thought you did not know me, or you wouldn t have spoken in that way.",
      "You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?",
      "he said, sarcastically.",
      "And what are you?",
      "inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.",
      "That man I ve seen before.",
      "Is he your son?",
      "She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.",
      "Miss Cathy, I interrupted, it will be three hours instead of one that we are out, presently.",
      "We really must go back.",
      "No, that man is not my son, answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.",
      "But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little rest.",
      "Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?",
      "You ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind welcome.",
      "I whispered Catherine that she mustn t, on any account, accede to the proposal: it was entirely out of the question.",
      "she asked, aloud.",
      "I m tired of running, and the ground is dewy: I can t sit here.",
      "Let us go, Ellen.",
      "Besides, he says I have seen his son.",
      "He s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags.",
      "Don t you?",
      "I do.",
      "Come, Nelly, hold your tongue it will be a treat for her to look in on us.",
      "Hareton, get forwards with the lass.",
      "You shall walk with me, Nelly.",
      "No, she s not going to any such place, I cried, struggling to release my arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones already, scampering round the brow at full speed.",
      "Her appointed companion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side, and vanished.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, it s very wrong, I continued: you know you mean no good.",
      "And there she ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever we return; and I shall have the blame.",
      "I want her to see Linton, he answered; he s looking better these few days; it s not often he s fit to be seen.",
      "And we ll soon persuade her to keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?",
      "The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in encouraging her to do so, I replied.",
      "My design is as honest as possible.",
      "I ll inform you of its whole scope, he said.",
      "That the two cousins may fall in love, and get married.",
      "I m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no expectations, and should she second my wishes she ll be provided for at once as joint successor with Linton.",
      "If Linton died, I answered, and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine would be the heir.",
      "No, she would not, he said.",
      "There is no clause in the will to secure it so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire their union, and am resolved to bring it about.",
      "And I m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again, I returned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.",
      "Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to open the door.",
      "My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury.",
      "Linton stood on the hearth.",
      "He had been out walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes.",
      "He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of sixteen.",
      "His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.",
      "Now, who is that?",
      "asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.",
      "Can you tell?",
      "Your son?",
      "she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the other.",
      "Yes, yes, answered he: but is this the only time you have beheld him?",
      "Think!",
      "you have a short memory.",
      "Linton, don t you recall your cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?",
      "What, Linton!",
      "cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.",
      "Is that little Linton?",
      "He s taller than I am!",
      "Are you Linton?",
      "The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each.",
      "Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits.",
      "Linton s looks and movements were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.",
      "After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.",
      "And you are my uncle, then!",
      "she cried, reaching up to salute him.",
      "I thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.",
      "Why don t you visit at the Grange with Linton?",
      "To live all these years such close neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?",
      "I visited it once or twice too often before you were born, he answered.",
      "There damn it!",
      "If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton: they are thrown away on me.",
      "Naughty Ellen!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her lavish caresses.",
      "Wicked Ellen!",
      "to try to hinder me from entering.",
      "But I ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle?",
      "and sometimes bring papa.",
      "Won t you be glad to see us?",
      "Of course, replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace, resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.",
      "But stay, he continued, turning towards the young lady.",
      "Now I think of it, I d better tell you.",
      "Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if you mention coming here to him, he ll put a veto on your visits altogether.",
      "Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless of seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must not mention it.",
      "Why did you quarrel?",
      "asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.",
      "He thought me too poor to wed his sister, answered Heathcliff, and was grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he ll never forgive it.",
      "That s wrong!",
      "said the young lady: some time I ll tell him so.",
      "But Linton and I have no share in your quarrel.",
      "I ll not come here, then; he shall come to the Grange.",
      "It will be too far for me, murmured her cousin: to walk four miles would kill me.",
      "No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every morning, but once or twice a week.",
      "The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.",
      "I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour, he muttered to me.",
      "Miss Catherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him to the devil.",
      "Now, if it had been Hareton!",
      "Do you know that, twenty times a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?",
      "I d have loved the lad had he been some one else.",
      "But I think he s safe from _her_ love.",
      "I ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself briskly.",
      "We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.",
      "Oh, confound the vapid thing!",
      "He s absorbed in drying his feet, and never looks at her.",
      "Linton!",
      "Yes, father, answered the boy.",
      "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit or a weasel s nest?",
      "Take her into the garden, before you change your shoes; and into the stable to see your horse.",
      "Wouldn t you rather sit here?",
      "asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone which expressed reluctance to move again.",
      "I don t know, she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and evidently eager to be active.",
      "He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.",
      "Heathcliff rose, and went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for Hareton.",
      "Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.",
      "The young man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his wetted hair.",
      "Oh, I ll ask _you_, uncle, cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the housekeeper s assertion.",
      "That is not my cousin, is he?",
      "Yes, he replied, your mother s nephew.",
      "Don t you like him?",
      "Catherine looked queer.",
      "Is he not a handsome lad?",
      "The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in Heathcliff s ear.",
      "He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very sensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his inferiority.",
      "But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming You ll be the favourite among us, Hareton!",
      "She says you are a What was it?",
      "Well, something very flattering.",
      "Here!",
      "you go with her round the farm.",
      "And behave like a gentleman, mind!",
      "Don t use any bad words; and don t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to hide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly, and keep your hands out of your pockets.",
      "Be off, and entertain her as nicely as you can.",
      "He watched the couple walking past the window.",
      "Earnshaw had his countenance completely averted from his companion.",
      "He seemed studying the familiar landscape with a stranger s and an artist s interest.",
      "Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.",
      "She then turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.",
      "I ve tied his tongue, observed Heathcliff.",
      "He ll not venture a single syllable all the time!",
      "Nelly, you recollect me at his age nay, some years younger.",
      "Did I ever look so stupid: so gaumless, as Joseph calls it?",
      "Worse, I replied, because more sullen with it.",
      "I ve a pleasure in him, he continued, reflecting aloud.",
      "He has satisfied my expectations.",
      "If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much.",
      "But he s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his feelings, having felt them myself.",
      "I know what he suffers now, for instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer, though.",
      "And he ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance.",
      "I ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness.",
      "I ve taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak.",
      "Don t you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?",
      "almost as proud as I am of mine.",
      "But there s this difference; one is gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver.",
      "_Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.",
      "_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.",
      "_I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any, but I, are aware of.",
      "And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me!",
      "You ll own that I ve outmatched Hindley there.",
      "If the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring s wrongs, I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!",
      "Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.",
      "I made no reply, because I saw that he expected none.",
      "Meantime, our young companion, who sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of Catherine s society for fear of a little fatigue.",
      "His father remarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely extended towards his cap.",
      "Get up, you idle boy!",
      "he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.",
      "Away after them!",
      "they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.",
      "Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.",
      "The lattice was open, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable attendant what was that inscription over the door?",
      "Hareton stared up, and scratched his head like a true clown.",
      "It s some damnable writing, he answered.",
      "I cannot read it.",
      "Can t read it?",
      "cried Catherine; I can read it: it s English.",
      "But I want to know why it is there.",
      "Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.",
      "He does not know his letters, he said to his cousin.",
      "Could you believe in the existence of such a colossal dunce?",
      "Is he all as he should be?",
      "asked Miss Cathy, seriously; or is he simple: not right?",
      "I ve questioned him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid I think he does not understand me.",
      "I can hardly understand _him_, I m sure!",
      "Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who certainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.",
      "There s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?",
      "My cousin fancies you are an idiot.",
      "There you experience the consequence of scorning book-larning, as you would say.",
      "Have you noticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?",
      "Why, where the devil is the use on t?",
      "growled Hareton, more ready in answering his daily companion.",
      "He was about to enlarge further, but the two youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being delighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of amusement.",
      "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
      "tittered Linton.",
      "Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can t open your mouth without one.",
      "Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!",
      "If thou weren t more a lass than a lad, I d fell thee this minute, I would; pitiful lath of a crater!",
      "retorted the angry boor, retreating, while his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular aversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway: the boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton s faults and deficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl relishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the ill-nature they evinced.",
      "I began to dislike, more than to compassionate Linton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.",
      "We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but happily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence.",
      "As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.",
      "Aha!",
      "she cried, you take papa s side, Ellen: you are partial I know; or else you wouldn t have cheated me so many years into the notion that Linton lived a long way from here.",
      "I m really extremely angry; only I m so pleased I can t show it!",
      "But you must hold your tongue about my uncle; he s _my_ uncle, remember; and I ll scold papa for quarrelling with him.",
      "And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of her mistake.",
      "She did not mention the visit that night, because she did not see Mr. Linton.",
      "Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.",
      "But he was too timid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun connection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good reasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.",
      "Papa!",
      "she exclaimed, after the morning s salutations, guess whom I saw yesterday, in my walk on the moors.",
      "Ah, papa, you started!",
      "you ve not done right, have you, now?",
      "I saw but listen, and you shall hear how I found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about Linton s coming back!",
      "She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing till she had concluded.",
      "Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew why he had concealed Linton s near neighbourhood from her?",
      "Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?",
      "It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff, she answered.",
      "Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?",
      "No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.",
      "I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton again.",
      "I meant to explain this some time as you grew older, and I m sorry I delayed it.",
      "But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa, observed Catherine, not at all convinced; and _he_ didn t object to our seeing each other: he said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella.",
      "And you won t. _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.",
      "My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-law s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.",
      "He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton s death.",
      "She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!",
      "was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a murderer.",
      "Miss Cathy conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse.",
      "She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject.",
      "He merely added: You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.",
      "Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a couple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the grounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her crying, on her knees by the bedside.",
      "Oh, fie, silly child!",
      "If you had any real griefs you d be ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.",
      "You never had one shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.",
      "Suppose, for a minute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how would you feel, then?",
      "Compare the present occasion with such an affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of coveting more.",
      "I m not crying for myself, Ellen, she answered, it s for him.",
      "He expected to see me again to-morrow, and there he ll be so disappointed: and he ll wait for me, and I sha n t come!",
      "said I, do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you have of him?",
      "Hasn t he Hareton for a companion?",
      "Not one in a hundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two afternoons.",
      "Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no further about you.",
      "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
      "she asked, rising to her feet.",
      "And just send those books I promised to lend him?",
      "His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely, when I told him how interesting they were.",
      "May I not, Ellen?",
      "No, indeed!",
      "replied I with decision.",
      "Then he would write to you, and there d never be an end of it.",
      "No, Miss Catherine, the acquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see that it is done.",
      "But how can one little note ?",
      "she recommenced, putting on an imploring countenance.",
      "Silence!",
      "We ll not begin with your little notes.",
      "Get into bed.",
      "She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great displeasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo!",
      "there was Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.",
      "You ll get nobody to take that, Catherine, I said, if you write it; and at present I shall put out your candle.",
      "I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my hand and a petulant cross thing!",
      "I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.",
      "The letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the village; but that I didn t learn till some time afterwards.",
      "Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves.",
      "She also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.",
      "One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of folded paper.",
      "My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock.",
      "Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber.",
      "Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence daily almost, it must have been from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by her.",
      "The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced source.",
      "Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.",
      "Whether they satisfied Cathy I don t know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.",
      "After turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.",
      "Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out.",
      "I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy s affectionate composition.",
      "It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin s: very pretty and very silly.",
      "I shook my head, and went meditating into the house.",
      "The day being wet, she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.",
      "Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings.",
      "Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single Oh!",
      "and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.",
      "Mr. Linton looked up.",
      "What is the matter, love?",
      "Have you hurt yourself?",
      "His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the hoard.",
      "No, papa!",
      "she gasped.",
      "Ellen!",
      "come upstairs I m sick!",
      "I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.",
      "you have got them, she commenced immediately, dropping on her knees, when we were enclosed alone.",
      "Oh, give them to me, and I ll never, never do so again!",
      "Don t tell papa.",
      "You have not told papa, Ellen?",
      "say you have not?",
      "I ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won t do it any more!",
      "With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.",
      "So, I exclaimed, Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems: you may well be ashamed of them!",
      "A fine bundle of trash you study in your leisure hours, to be sure: why, it s good enough to be printed!",
      "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?",
      "I hav n t shown it yet, but you needn t imagine I shall keep your ridiculous secrets.",
      "and you must have led the way in writing such absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I m certain.",
      "sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart.",
      "I didn t once think of loving him till _Loving_!",
      "cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.",
      "_Loving_!",
      "Did anybody ever hear the like!",
      "I might just as well talk of loving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.",
      "Pretty loving, indeed!",
      "and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life!",
      "Now here is the babyish trash.",
      "I m going with it to the library; and we ll see what your father says to such _loving_.",
      "She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and then she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them do anything rather than show them.",
      "And being really fully as much inclined to laugh as scold for I esteemed it all girlish vanity I at length relented in a measure, and asked, If I consent to burn them, will you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings, nor playthings?",
      "We don t send playthings, cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her shame.",
      "Nor anything at all, then, my lady?",
      "Unless you will, here I go.",
      "I promise, Ellen!",
      "she cried, catching my dress.",
      "Oh, put them in the fire, do, do!",
      "But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too painful to be borne.",
      "She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her one or two.",
      "One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton s sake!",
      "I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an angle, and the flame curled up the chimney.",
      "I will have one, you cruel wretch!",
      "she screamed, darting her hand into the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense of her fingers.",
      "Very well and I will have some to exhibit to papa!",
      "I answered, shaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.",
      "She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to finish the immolation.",
      "It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment.",
      "I descended to tell my master that the young lady s qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while.",
      "She wouldn t dine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect.",
      "Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of paper, inscribed, Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.",
      "And, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.",
      "CHAPTER XXII Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.",
      "Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.",
      "Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her reading less, and taking more exercise.",
      "She had his companionship no longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible, with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.",
      "On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November a fresh watery afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds dark grey streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain I requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of showers.",
      "She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited and that she invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.",
      "She went sadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might well have tempted her to race.",
      "And often, from the side of my eye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek.",
      "I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.",
      "On one side of the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.",
      "In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.",
      "From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs my nursery lore to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.",
      "Look, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree.",
      "Winter is not here yet.",
      "There s a little flower up yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in July with a lilac mist.",
      "Will you clamber up, and pluck it to show to papa?",
      "Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length No, I ll not touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?",
      "Yes, I observed, about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks are bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.",
      "You re so low, I daresay I shall keep up with you.",
      "No, she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.",
      "Catherine, why are you crying, love?",
      "I asked, approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder.",
      "You mustn t cry because papa has a cold; be thankful it is nothing worse.",
      "She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by sobs.",
      "Oh, it _will_ be something worse, she said.",
      "And what shall I do when papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
      "I can t forget your words, Ellen; they are always in my ear.",
      "How life will be changed, how dreary the world will be, when papa and you are dead.",
      "None can tell whether you won t die before us, I replied.",
      "It s wrong to anticipate evil.",
      "We ll hope there are years and years to come before any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.",
      "My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.",
      "And suppose Mr. Linton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you have counted, Miss.",
      "And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand?",
      "But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa, she remarked, gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation.",
      "Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her, I replied.",
      "She wasn t as happy as Master: she hadn t as much to live for.",
      "All you need do, is to wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!",
      "I ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.",
      "I fret about nothing on earth except papa s illness, answered my companion.",
      "I care for nothing in comparison with papa.",
      "And I ll never never oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word to vex him.",
      "I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than myself.",
      "Good words, I replied.",
      "But deeds must prove it also; and after he is well, remember you don t forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.",
      "As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch the upper, except from Cathy s present station.",
      "In stretching to pull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed scrambling down to recover it.",
      "I bid her be cautious lest she got a fall, and she nimbly disappeared.",
      "But the return was no such easy matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.",
      "I, like a fool, didn t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and exclaiming Ellen!",
      "you ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run round to the porter s lodge.",
      "I can t scale the ramparts on this side!",
      "Stay where you are, I answered; I have my bundle of keys in my pocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I ll go.",
      "Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I tried all the large keys in succession.",
      "I had applied the last, and found that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching sound arrested me.",
      "It was the trot of a horse; Cathy s dance stopped also.",
      "I whispered.",
      "Ellen, I wish you could open the door, whispered back my companion, anxiously.",
      "Ho, Miss Linton!",
      "cried a deep voice (the rider s), I m glad to meet you.",
      "Don t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and obtain.",
      "I sha n t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff, answered Catherine.",
      "Papa says you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the same.",
      "That is nothing to the purpose, said Heathcliff.",
      "(He it was.)",
      "I don t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your attention.",
      "Yes; you have cause to blush.",
      "Two or three months since, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton?",
      "making love in play, eh?",
      "You deserved, both of you, flogging for that!",
      "You especially, the elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out.",
      "I ve got your letters, and if you give me any pertness I ll send them to your father.",
      "I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn t you?",
      "Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond.",
      "He was in earnest: in love, really.",
      "As true as I live, he s dying for you; breaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.",
      "Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his idiocy, he gets worse daily; and he ll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!",
      "How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?",
      "I called from the inside.",
      "Pray ride on!",
      "How can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods?",
      "Miss Cathy, I ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won t believe that vile nonsense.",
      "You can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger.",
      "I was not aware there were eavesdroppers, muttered the detected villain.",
      "Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don t like your double-dealing, he added aloud.",
      "How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to affirm I hated the poor child ?",
      "and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my door-stones?",
      "Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I have not spoken truth: do, there s a darling!",
      "Just imagine your father in my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father himself entreated him; and don t, from pure stupidity, fall into the same error.",
      "I swear, on my salvation, he s going to his grave, and none but you can save him!",
      "The lock gave way and I issued out.",
      "I swear Linton is dying, repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.",
      "And grief and disappointment are hastening his death.",
      "Nelly, if you won t let her go, you can walk over yourself.",
      "But I shall not return till this time next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin.",
      "Come in, said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to re-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.",
      "He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed Miss Catherine, I ll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and Joseph have less.",
      "I ll own that he s with a harsh set.",
      "He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best medicine.",
      "Don t mind Mrs. Dean s cruel cautions; but be generous, and contrive to see him.",
      "He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be persuaded that you don t hate him, since you neither write nor call.",
      "I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and warned us to avoid delay.",
      "Our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined instinctively that Catherine s heart was clouded now in double darkness.",
      "Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.",
      "The master had retired to rest before we came in.",
      "Cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.",
      "She returned, and asked me to sit with her in the library.",
      "We took our tea together; and afterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was weary.",
      "I got a book, and pretended to read.",
      "As soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion.",
      "I suffered her to enjoy it a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr. Heathcliff s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would coincide.",
      "Alas!",
      "I hadn t skill to counteract the effect his account had produced: it was just what he intended.",
      "You may be right, Ellen, she answered; but I shall never feel at ease till I know.",
      "And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don t write, and convince him that I shall not change.",
      "What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?",
      "We parted that night hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to Wuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress s pony.",
      "I couldn t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected countenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was founded on fact.",
      "CHAPTER XXIII The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning half frost, half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our path gurgling from the uplands.",
      "My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.",
      "We entered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own affirmation.",
      "Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.",
      "Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself.",
      "I asked if the master was in?",
      "My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown deaf, and repeated it louder.",
      "Na ay!",
      "he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.",
      "yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough.",
      "Joseph!",
      "cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner room.",
      "How often am I to call you?",
      "There are only a few red ashes now.",
      "come this moment.",
      "Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no ear for this appeal.",
      "The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.",
      "We knew Linton s tones, and entered.",
      "Oh, I hope you ll die in a garret, starved to death!",
      "said the boy, mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.",
      "He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.",
      "Is that you, Miss Linton?",
      "he said, raising his head from the arm of the great chair, in which he reclined.",
      "No don t kiss me: it takes my breath.",
      "Dear me!",
      "Papa said you would call, continued he, after recovering a little from Catherine s embrace; while she stood by looking very contrite.",
      "Will you shut the door, if you please?",
      "you left it open; and those those _detestable_ creatures won t bring coals to the fire.",
      "It s so cold!",
      "I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.",
      "The invalid complained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.",
      "Well, Linton, murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed, are you glad to see me?",
      "Can I do you any good?",
      "Why didn t you come before?",
      "You should have come, instead of writing.",
      "It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.",
      "I d far rather have talked to you.",
      "Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything else.",
      "I wonder where Zillah is!",
      "Will you (looking at me) step into the kitchen and see?",
      "I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run to and fro at his behest, I replied Nobody is out there but Joseph.",
      "I want to drink, he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.",
      "Zillah is constantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it s miserable!",
      "And I m obliged to come down here they resolved never to hear me upstairs.",
      "Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?",
      "I asked, perceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.",
      "Attentive?",
      "He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least, he cried.",
      "The wretches!",
      "Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at me!",
      "I hate him!",
      "indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.",
      "Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.",
      "He bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion, appeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.",
      "And are you glad to see me?",
      "asked she, reiterating her former question, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.",
      "Yes, I am.",
      "It s something new to hear a voice like yours!",
      "But I have been vexed, because you wouldn t come.",
      "And papa swore it was owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the master of the Grange than your father by this time.",
      "But you don t despise me, do you, Miss ?",
      "I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy, interrupted my young lady.",
      "Despise you?",
      "Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than anybody living.",
      "I don t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come when he returns: will he stay away many days?",
      "Not many, answered Linton; but he goes on to the moors frequently, since the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence.",
      "Do say you will.",
      "I think I should not be peevish with you: you d not provoke me, and you d always be ready to help me, wouldn t you?",
      "Yes, said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair, if I could only get papa s consent, I d spend half my time with you.",
      "Pretty Linton!",
      "I wish you were my brother.",
      "And then you would like me as well as your father?",
      "observed he, more cheerfully.",
      "But papa says you would love me better than him and all the world, if you were my wife; so I d rather you were that.",
      "No, I should never love anybody better than papa, she returned gravely.",
      "And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me.",
      "Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father s aversion to her aunt.",
      "I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.",
      "I couldn t succeed till everything she knew was out.",
      "Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted her relation was false.",
      "Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods, she answered pertly.",
      "_My_ papa scorns yours!",
      "cried Linton.",
      "He calls him a sneaking fool.",
      "Yours is a wicked man, retorted Catherine; and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says.",
      "He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she did.",
      "She didn t leave him, said the boy; you sha n t contradict me.",
      "She did, cried my young lady.",
      "Well, I ll tell _you_ something!",
      "Your mother hated your father: now then.",
      "exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.",
      "And she loved mine, added he.",
      "You little liar!",
      "I hate you now!",
      "she panted, and her face grew red with passion.",
      "She did!",
      "sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair, and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant, who stood behind.",
      "Hush, Master Heathcliff!",
      "I said; that s your father s tale, too, I suppose.",
      "It isn t: you hold your tongue!",
      "he answered.",
      "She did, she did, Catherine!",
      "she did, she did!",
      "Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm.",
      "He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph.",
      "It lasted so long that it frightened even me.",
      "As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the mischief she had done: though she said nothing.",
      "I held him till the fit exhausted itself.",
      "Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down silently.",
      "Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.",
      "How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?",
      "I inquired, after waiting ten minutes.",
      "I wish _she_ felt as I do, he replied: spiteful, cruel thing!",
      "Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life.",
      "And I was better to-day: and there his voice died in a whimper.",
      "_I_ didn t strike you!",
      "muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion.",
      "He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflexions of his voice.",
      "I m sorry I hurt you, Linton, she said at length, racked beyond endurance.",
      "But _I_ couldn t have been hurt by that little push, and I had no idea that you could, either: you re not much, are you, Linton?",
      "Don t let me go home thinking I ve done you harm.",
      "Answer!",
      "speak to me.",
      "I can t speak to you, he murmured; you ve hurt me so that I shall lie awake all night choking with this cough.",
      "If you had it you d know what it was; but _you ll_ be comfortably asleep while I m in agony, and nobody near me.",
      "I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!",
      "And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.",
      "Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights, I said, it won t be Miss who spoils your ease: you d be the same had she never come.",
      "However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you ll get quieter when we leave you.",
      "Must I go?",
      "asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him.",
      "Do you want me to go, Linton?",
      "You can t alter what you ve done, he replied pettishly, shrinking from her, unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.",
      "Well, then, I must go?",
      "Let me alone, at least, said he; I can t bear your talking.",
      "She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door, and I followed.",
      "We were recalled by a scream.",
      "Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can.",
      "I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him.",
      "Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.",
      "I shall lift him on to the settle, I said, and he may roll about as he pleases: we can t stop to watch him.",
      "I hope you are satisfied, Miss Cathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.",
      "Now, then, there he is!",
      "Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense, he ll be glad to lie still.",
      "She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he rejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a stone or a block of wood.",
      "She tried to put it more comfortably.",
      "I can t do with that, he said; it s not high enough.",
      "Catherine brought another to lay above it.",
      "That s _too_ high, murmured the provoking thing.",
      "How must I arrange it, then?",
      "she asked despairingly.",
      "He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and converted her shoulder into a support.",
      "No, that won t do, I said.",
      "You ll be content with the cushion, Master Heathcliff.",
      "Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot remain five minutes longer.",
      "Yes, yes, we can!",
      "replied Cathy.",
      "He s good and patient now.",
      "He s beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come again.",
      "Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn t come, if I have hurt you.",
      "You must come, to cure me, he answered.",
      "You ought to come, because you have hurt me: you know you have extremely!",
      "I was not as ill when you entered as I am at present was I?",
      "But you ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.",
      "I didn t do it all, said his cousin.",
      "However, we ll be friends now.",
      "And you want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?",
      "I told you I did, he replied impatiently.",
      "Sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee.",
      "That s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons together.",
      "Sit quite still and don t talk: but you may sing a song, if you can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad one of those you promised to teach me; or a story.",
      "I d rather have a ballad, though: begin.",
      "Catherine repeated the longest she could remember.",
      "The employment pleased both mightily.",
      "Linton would have another, and after that another, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on until the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court, returning for his dinner.",
      "And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?",
      "asked young Heathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.",
      "No, I answered, nor next day neither.",
      "She, however, gave a different response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear.",
      "You won t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!",
      "I commenced, when we were out of the house.",
      "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
      "She smiled.",
      "Oh, I ll take good care, I continued: I ll have that lock mended, and you can escape by no way else.",
      "I can get over the wall, she said laughing.",
      "The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.",
      "And besides, I m almost seventeen: I m a woman.",
      "And I m certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him.",
      "I m older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I not?",
      "And he ll soon do as I direct him, with some slight coaxing.",
      "He s a pretty little darling when he s good.",
      "I d make such a pet of him, if he were mine.",
      "We should never quarrel, should we, after we were used to each other?",
      "Don t you like him, Ellen?",
      "Like him!",
      "The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens.",
      "Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured, he ll not win twenty.",
      "I doubt whether he ll see spring, indeed.",
      "And small loss to his family whenever he drops off.",
      "And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he d be.",
      "I m glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.",
      "My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.",
      "To speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings.",
      "He s younger than I, she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, and he ought to live the longest: he will he must live as long as I do.",
      "He s as strong now as when he first came into the north; I m positive of that.",
      "It s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa has.",
      "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn t he?",
      "Well, well, I cried, after all, we needn t trouble ourselves; for listen, Miss, and mind, I ll keep my word, if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton, and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.",
      "It has been revived, muttered Cathy, sulkily.",
      "Must not be continued, then, I said.",
      "We ll see, was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.",
      "We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence.",
      "As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights had done the mischief.",
      "On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since.",
      "My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and cheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.",
      "It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had.",
      "The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton s room she appeared at my bedside.",
      "Her day was divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.",
      "She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.",
      "I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after six o clock, thus the evening was her own.",
      "Poor thing!",
      "I never considered what she did with herself after tea.",
      "And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.",
      "CHAPTER XXIV At the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about the house.",
      "And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak.",
      "We were in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.",
      "She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then came frequent questions.",
      "Ellen, are not you tired?",
      "Hadn t you better lie down now?",
      "You ll be sick, keeping up so long, Ellen.",
      "No, no, dear, I m not tired, I returned, continually.",
      "Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation.",
      "It changed to yawning, and stretching, and Ellen, I m tired.",
      "Give over then and talk, I answered.",
      "That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till eight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep; judging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.",
      "The following night she seemed more impatient still; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me.",
      "I thought her conduct odd; and having remained alone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs in the dark.",
      "No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.",
      "The servants affirmed they had not seen her.",
      "I listened at Mr. Edgar s door; all was silence.",
      "I returned to her apartment, extinguished my candle, and seated myself in the window.",
      "The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment.",
      "I did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its emerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms.",
      "He stood a considerable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and reappeared presently, leading Miss s pony; and there she was, just dismounted, and walking by its side.",
      "The man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable.",
      "Cathy entered by the casement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited her.",
      "She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.",
      "The surprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and stood fixed.",
      "My dear Miss Catherine, I began, too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold, where have you been riding out at this hour?",
      "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
      "Where have you been?",
      "To the bottom of the park, she stammered.",
      "I didn t tell a tale.",
      "And nowhere else?",
      "I demanded.",
      "No, was the muttered reply.",
      "Oh, Catherine!",
      "I cried, sorrowfully.",
      "You know you have been doing wrong, or you wouldn t be driven to uttering an untruth to me.",
      "That does grieve me.",
      "I d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a deliberate lie.",
      "She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my neck.",
      "Well, Ellen, I m so afraid of you being angry, she said.",
      "Promise not to be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.",
      "We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced I ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I ve never missed going a day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your room.",
      "I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn t scold _him_ either, mind.",
      "I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home.",
      "It was not to amuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time.",
      "Now and then I was happy: once in a week perhaps.",
      "At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble.",
      "While Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn t come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the pony.",
      "He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that satisfied him better.",
      "On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us that, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off with his dogs robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards we might do what we liked.",
      "She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in the arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would go, and what we would do in summer.",
      "I needn t repeat that, because you would call it silly.",
      "One time, however, we were near quarrelling.",
      "He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.",
      "That was his most perfect idea of heaven s happiness: mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and blackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy.",
      "He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee.",
      "I said his heaven would be only half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.",
      "At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.",
      "After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and we d have a game at blindman s-buff; she should try to catch us: you used to, you know, Ellen.",
      "He wouldn t: there was no pleasure in it, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me.",
      "We found two in a cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and shuttlecocks.",
      "One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn t like it.",
      "I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his chair.",
      "That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs _your_ songs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following evening; and I promised.",
      "Minny and I went flying home as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till morning.",
      "On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was beautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared.",
      "I shall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights me more, my pretty Linton will.",
      "I trotted up their garden, and was turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.",
      "He patted Minny s neck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him.",
      "I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick him.",
      "He answered in his vulgar accent, It wouldn t do mitch hurt if it did; and surveyed its legs with a smile.",
      "I was half inclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation: Miss Catherine!",
      "I can read yon, now.",
      "Wonderful, I exclaimed.",
      "Pray let us hear you you _are_ grown clever!",
      "He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name Hareton Earnshaw.",
      "And the figures?",
      "I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a dead halt.",
      "I cannot tell them yet, he answered.",
      "Oh, you dunce!",
      "I said, laughing heartily at his failure.",
      "The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl gathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was, contempt.",
      "I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.",
      "He reddened I saw that by the moonlight dropped his hand from the latch, and skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.",
      "He imagined himself to be as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own name; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn t think the same.",
      "Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!",
      "I shall not scold, but I don t like your conduct there.",
      "If you had remembered that Hareton was your cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way.",
      "At least, it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please you.",
      "To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.",
      "Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?",
      "He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so unjustly.",
      "Well, Ellen, you won t cry about it, will you?",
      "she exclaimed, surprised at my earnestness.",
      "But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.",
      "I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.",
      "I m ill to-night, Catherine, love, he said; and you must have all the talk, and let me listen.",
      "Come, and sit by me.",
      "I was sure you wouldn t break your word, and I ll make you promise again, before you go.",
      "I knew now that I mustn t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly and put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.",
      "I had brought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having gathered venom with reflection.",
      "He advanced direct to us, seized Linton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.",
      "Get to thy own room!",
      "he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion; and his face looked swelled and furious.",
      "Take her there if she comes to see thee: thou shalln t keep me out of this.",
      "Begone wi ye both!",
      "He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him into the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly longing to knock me down.",
      "I was afraid for a moment, and I let one volume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out.",
      "I heard a malignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious Joseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.",
      "I wer sure he d sarve ye out!",
      "He s a grand lad!",
      "He s getten t raight sperrit in him!",
      "_He_ knaws ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t maister yonder Ech, ech, ech!",
      "He made ye skift properly!",
      "Ech, ech, ech!",
      "Where must we go?",
      "I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch s mockery.",
      "Linton was white and trembling.",
      "He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!",
      "he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic, powerless fury.",
      "He grasped the handle of the door, and shook it: it was fastened inside.",
      "If you don t let me in, I ll kill you!",
      "he rather shrieked than said.",
      "Devil!",
      "I ll kill you I ll kill you!",
      "Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.",
      "Thear, that s t father!",
      "That s father!",
      "We ve allas summut o either side in us.",
      "Niver heed, Hareton, lad dunnut be feard he cannot get at thee!",
      "I took hold of Linton s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he shrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed.",
      "At last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell on the ground.",
      "I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called for Zillah, as loud as I could.",
      "She soon heard me: she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired what there was to do?",
      "I hadn t breath to explain; dragging her in, I looked about for Linton.",
      "Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs.",
      "Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and said I shouldn t go in: I must go home.",
      "I exclaimed that he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter.",
      "Joseph locked the door, and declared I should do no sich stuff, and asked me whether I were bahn to be as mad as him.",
      "I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.",
      "She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn t do with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.",
      "Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!",
      "I sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me wisht, and denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation.",
      "Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold of me.",
      "Miss Catherine, I m ill grieved, he began, but it s rayther too bad I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me.",
      "He let go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more than half out of my senses.",
      "I didn t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn t go to Wuthering Heights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely excited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.",
      "On the third day I took courage: at least, I couldn t bear longer suspense, and stole off once more.",
      "I went at five o clock, and walked; fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton s room, unobserved.",
      "However, the dogs gave notice of my approach.",
      "Zillah received me, and saying the lad was mending nicely, showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books.",
      "But he would neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy temper.",
      "And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame!",
      "Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked from the room.",
      "He sent after me a faint Catherine!",
      "He did not reckon on being answered so: but I wouldn t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no more.",
      "But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.",
      "It _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong to refrain.",
      "Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said Yes, and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills.",
      "I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use trying to conceal my presence.",
      "Young master is in the house, said Zillah, as she saw me making for the parlour.",
      "I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room directly.",
      "Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true As you don t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to hurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see me, and that he mustn t invent any more falsehoods on the subject.",
      "Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine, he answered.",
      "You are so much happier than I am, you ought to be better.",
      "Papa talks enough of my defects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt myself.",
      "I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody!",
      "I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you ll get rid of an annoyance.",
      "Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy.",
      "And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn t, and cannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent it till I die!",
      "I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again.",
      "We were reconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not entirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature.",
      "He ll never let his friends be at ease, and he ll never be at ease himself!",
      "I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night; because his father returned the day after.",
      "About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were the first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now with his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I ve learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at all.",
      "Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.",
      "I can t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened.",
      "Linton had certainly behaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I interrupted Mr. Heathcliff s lecture by entering and telling him so.",
      "He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of the matter.",
      "Since then, I ve told Linton he must whisper his bitter things.",
      "Now, Ellen, you have heard all.",
      "I can t be prevented from going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas, if you ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of none.",
      "You ll not tell, will you?",
      "It will be very heartless, if you do.",
      "I ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine, I replied.",
      "It requires some study; and so I ll leave you to your rest, and go think it over.",
      "I thought it over aloud, in my master s presence; walking straight from her room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton.",
      "Mr. Linton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.",
      "In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end.",
      "In vain she wept and writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights.",
      "Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew s disposition and state of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.",
      "CHAPTER XXV These things happened last winter, sir, said Mrs. Dean; hardly more than a year ago.",
      "Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!",
      "Yet, who knows how long you ll be a stranger?",
      "You re too young to rest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could see Catherine Linton and not love her.",
      "You smile; but why do you look so lively and interested when I talk about her?",
      "and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace?",
      "and why ?",
      "Stop, my good friend!",
      "It may be very possible that _I_ should love her; but would she love me?",
      "I doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here.",
      "I m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return.",
      "Go on.",
      "Was Catherine obedient to her father s commands?",
      "She was, continued the housekeeper.",
      "Her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her.",
      "He said to me, a few days afterwards, I wish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call.",
      "Tell me, sincerely, what you think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect of improvement, as he grows a man?",
      "He s very delicate, sir, I replied; and scarcely likely to reach manhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.",
      "However, master, you ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his being of age.",
      "Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk.",
      "It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the sparely-scattered gravestones.",
      "I ve prayed often, he half soliloquised, for the approach of what is coming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it.",
      "I thought the memory of the hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow!",
      "Ellen, I ve been very happy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side.",
      "But I ve been as happy musing by myself among those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June evenings, on the green mound of her mother s grave, and wishing yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it.",
      "What can I do for Cathy?",
      "How must I quit her?",
      "I d not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss.",
      "I d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing!",
      "But should Linton be unworthy only a feeble tool to his father I cannot abandon her to him!",
      "And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.",
      "Darling!",
      "I d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before me.",
      "Resign her to God as it is, sir, I answered, and if we should lose you which may He forbid under His providence, I ll stand her friend and counsellor to the last.",
      "Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don t fear that she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded.",
      "Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.",
      "To her inexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.",
      "On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was raining, and I observed You ll surely not go out to-night, sir?",
      "He answered, No, I ll defer it this year a little longer.",
      "He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the invalid been presentable, I ve no doubt his father would have permitted him to come.",
      "As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but his uncle s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.",
      "That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.",
      "Heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently for Catherine s company, then.",
      "I do not ask, he said, that she may visit here; but am I never to see her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her to come to mine?",
      "Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence!",
      "We have done nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.",
      "Dear uncle!",
      "send me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at Thrushcross Grange.",
      "I believe an interview would convince you that my father s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.",
      "You inquire after my health it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?",
      "Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his request; because he could not accompany Catherine.",
      "He said, in summer, perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.",
      "Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises.",
      "Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining.",
      "Though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady s fortune, he had a natural desire that she might retain or at least return in a short time to the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us.",
      "I, for my part, began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object.",
      "I could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death.",
      "CHAPTER XXVI Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride to join her cousin.",
      "It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.",
      "On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger, told us that, Maister Linton wer just o this side th Heights: and he d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.",
      "Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle, I observed: he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at once.",
      "Well, we ll turn our horses heads round when we reach him, answered my companion; our excursion shall lie towards home.",
      "But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount, and leave ours to graze.",
      "He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and did not rise till we came within a few yards.",
      "Then he walked so feebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed, Why, Master Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.",
      "How ill you do look!",
      "Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?",
      "No better better!",
      "he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed.",
      "But you have been worse, persisted his cousin; worse than when I saw you last; you are thinner, and I m tired, he interrupted, hurriedly.",
      "It is too hot for walking, let us rest here.",
      "And, in the morning, I often feel sick papa says I grow so fast.",
      "Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.",
      "This is something like your paradise, said she, making an effort at cheerfulness.",
      "You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest?",
      "This is nearly yours, only there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than sunshine.",
      "Next week, if you can, we ll ride down to the Grange Park, and try mine.",
      "Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.",
      "His lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment.",
      "An indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner.",
      "The pettishness that might be caressed into fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an insult.",
      "Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to depart.",
      "That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of agitation.",
      "He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at least.",
      "But I think, said Cathy, you d be more comfortable at home than sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you, I d willingly stay.",
      "Stay to rest yourself, he replied.",
      "And, Catherine, don t think or say that I m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.",
      "Tell uncle I m in tolerable health, will you?",
      "I ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.",
      "I couldn t affirm that you are, observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth.",
      "And be here again next Thursday, continued he, shunning her puzzled gaze.",
      "And give him my thanks for permitting you to come my best thanks, Catherine.",
      "And and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked you about me, don t lead him to suppose that I ve been extremely silent and stupid: don t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing he ll be angry.",
      "I care nothing for his anger, exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be its object.",
      "But I do, said her cousin, shuddering.",
      "_Don t_ provoke him against me, Catherine, for he is very hard.",
      "Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?",
      "Has he grown weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?",
      "Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.",
      "Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?",
      "she whispered in my ear, at last.",
      "I can t tell why we should stay.",
      "He s asleep, and papa will be wanting us back.",
      "Well, we must not leave him asleep, I answered; wait till he wakes, and be patient.",
      "You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to see poor Linton has soon evaporated!",
      "Why did _he_ wish to see me?",
      "returned Catherine.",
      "In his crossest humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious mood.",
      "It s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform this interview for fear his father should scold him.",
      "But I m hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance.",
      "And, though I m glad he s better in health, I m sorry he s so much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.",
      "You think _he is_ better in health, then?",
      "Yes, she answered; because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings, you know.",
      "He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell papa; but he s better, very likely.",
      "There you differ with me, Miss Cathy, I remarked; I should conjecture him to be far worse.",
      "Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if any one had called his name.",
      "No, said Catherine; unless in dreams.",
      "I cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.",
      "I thought I heard my father, he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab above us.",
      "You are sure nobody spoke?",
      "Quite sure, replied his cousin.",
      "Only Ellen and I were disputing concerning your health.",
      "Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we separated in winter?",
      "If you be, I m certain one thing is not stronger your regard for me: speak, are you?",
      "The tears gushed from Linton s eyes as he answered, Yes, yes, I am!",
      "And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner.",
      "Cathy rose.",
      "For to-day we must part, she said.",
      "And I won t conceal that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I ll mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Hush, murmured Linton; for God s sake, hush!",
      "He s coming.",
      "And he clung to Catherine s arm, striving to detain her; but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who obeyed her like a dog.",
      "I ll be here next Thursday, she cried, springing to the saddle.",
      "Good-bye.",
      "Quick, Ellen!",
      "And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was he in anticipating his father s approach.",
      "Before we reached home, Catherine s displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts about Linton s actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey would make us better judges.",
      "My master requested an account of our ongoings.",
      "His nephew s offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.",
      "CHAPTER XXVII Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton s state.",
      "The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.",
      "Catherine we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability, gradually ripening into certainty.",
      "She had not the heart to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily the brief period he could bear to sit up and his chamber, had become her whole world.",
      "She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.",
      "Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.",
      "He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton s letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.",
      "And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.",
      "We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever respired it, though dying, might revive.",
      "Catherine s face was just like the landscape shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares.",
      "We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.",
      "My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn t risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.",
      "Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like fear.",
      "It is late!",
      "he said, speaking short and with difficulty.",
      "Is not your father very ill?",
      "I thought you wouldn t come.",
      "_Why_ won t you be candid?",
      "cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.",
      "Why cannot you say at once you don t want me?",
      "It is strange, Linton, that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!",
      "Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but his cousin s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour.",
      "My father _is_ very ill, she said; and why am I called from his bedside?",
      "Why didn t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you wished I wouldn t keep it?",
      "Come!",
      "I desire an explanation: playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can t dance attendance on your affectations now!",
      "My affectations!",
      "he murmured; what are they?",
      "For heaven s sake, Catherine, don t look so angry!",
      "Despise me as much as you please; I am a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can t be scorned enough; but I m too mean for your anger.",
      "Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.",
      "cried Catherine in a passion.",
      "Foolish, silly boy!",
      "And there!",
      "he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him!",
      "You needn t bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your service.",
      "Get off!",
      "I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from the hearth-stone, and pretending what do we pretend?",
      "Let go my frock!",
      "If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity.",
      "Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.",
      "Rise, and don t degrade yourself into an abject reptile _don t_!",
      "With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror.",
      "he sobbed, I cannot bear it!",
      "Catherine, Catherine, I m a traitor, too, and I dare not tell you!",
      "But leave me, and I shall be killed!",
      "_Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn t harm you.",
      "You ll not go, then?",
      "kind, sweet, good Catherine!",
      "And perhaps you _will_ consent and he ll let me die with you!",
      "My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.",
      "The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.",
      "Consent to what?",
      "To stay!",
      "tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will.",
      "You contradict your own words, and distract me!",
      "Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart.",
      "You wouldn t injure me, Linton, would you?",
      "You wouldn t let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?",
      "I ll believe you are a coward, for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.",
      "But my father threatened me, gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated fingers, and I dread him I dread him!",
      "I _dare_ not tell!",
      "Oh, well!",
      "said Catherine, with scornful compassion, keep your secret: _I m_ no coward.",
      "Save yourself: I m not afraid!",
      "Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.",
      "I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when, hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, descending the Heights.",
      "He didn t cast a glance towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton s sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn t avoid doubting, he said It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly.",
      "How are you at the Grange?",
      "Let us hear.",
      "The rumour goes, he added, in a lower tone, that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his illness?",
      "No; my master is dying, I replied: it is true enough.",
      "A sad thing it will be for us all, but a blessing for him!",
      "How long will he last, do you think?",
      "I don t know, I said.",
      "Because, he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed under his eye Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I d thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him!",
      "Hallo!",
      "has the whelp been playing that game long?",
      "I _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling.",
      "Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?",
      "Lively?",
      "no he has shown the greatest distress, I answered.",
      "To see him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.",
      "He shall be, in a day or two, muttered Heathcliff.",
      "But first get up, Linton!",
      "Don t grovel on the ground there: up, this moment!",
      "Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused by his father s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing else to produce such humiliation.",
      "He made several efforts to obey, but his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again with a moan.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf.",
      "Now, said he, with curbed ferocity, I m getting angry and if you don t command that paltry spirit of yours _damn_ you!",
      "get up directly!",
      "I will, father, he panted.",
      "Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.",
      "I ve done as you wished, I m sure.",
      "Catherine will tell you that I that I have been cheerful.",
      "keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.",
      "Take mine, said his father; stand on your feet.",
      "There now she ll lend you her arm: that s right, look at _her_.",
      "You would imagine I was the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.",
      "Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you?",
      "He shudders if I touch him.",
      "Linton dear!",
      "whispered Catherine, I can t go to Wuthering Heights: papa has forbidden me.",
      "He ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?",
      "I can never re-enter that house, he answered.",
      "I m _not_ to re-enter it without you!",
      "cried his father.",
      "We ll respect Catherine s filial scruples.",
      "Nelly, take him in, and I ll follow your advice concerning the doctor, without delay.",
      "You ll do well, replied I.",
      "But I must remain with my mistress: to mind your son is not my business.",
      "You are very stiff, said Heathcliff, I know that: but you ll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.",
      "Come, then, my hero.",
      "Are you willing to return, escorted by me?",
      "He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.",
      "However I disapproved, I couldn t hinder her: indeed, how could she have refused him herself?",
      "What was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy.",
      "We reached the threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me to shut the door.",
      "He shut and locked it also.",
      "I started.",
      "You shall have tea before you go home, he added.",
      "I am by myself.",
      "Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I m used to being alone, I d rather have some interesting company, if I can get it.",
      "Miss Linton, take your seat by _him_.",
      "I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer.",
      "It is Linton, I mean.",
      "How she does stare!",
      "It s odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me!",
      "Had I been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening s amusement.",
      "He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, By hell!",
      "I hate them.",
      "I am not afraid of you!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter part of his speech.",
      "She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution.",
      "Give me that key: I will have it!",
      "she said.",
      "I wouldn t eat or drink here, if I were starving.",
      "Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.",
      "He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited it.",
      "She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered it speedily.",
      "Now, Catherine Linton, he said, stand off, or I shall knock you down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.",
      "Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents again.",
      "We _will_ go!",
      "she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply.",
      "Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.",
      "Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face.",
      "He opened them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.",
      "At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously.",
      "You villain!",
      "I began to cry, you villain!",
      "A touch on the chest silenced me: I am stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vessel.",
      "The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on.",
      "She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.",
      "I know how to chastise children, you see, said the scoundrel, grimly, as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor.",
      "Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!",
      "I shall be your father, to-morrow all the father you ll have in a few days and you shall have plenty of that.",
      "You can bear plenty; you re no weakling: you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!",
      "Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.",
      "Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had alighted on another than him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea himself.",
      "The cups and saucers were laid ready.",
      "He poured it out, and handed me a cup.",
      "Wash away your spleen, he said.",
      "And help your own naughty pet and mine.",
      "It is not poisoned, though I prepared it.",
      "I m going out to seek your horses.",
      "Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.",
      "We tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the windows they were too narrow for even Cathy s little figure.",
      "Master Linton, I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, you know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin s. Yes, Linton, you must tell, said Catherine.",
      "It was for your sake I came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.",
      "Give me some tea, I m thirsty, and then I ll tell you, he answered.",
      "Mrs. Dean, go away.",
      "I don t like you standing over me.",
      "Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup.",
      "I won t drink that.",
      "Give me another.",
      "Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face.",
      "I felt disgusted at the little wretch s composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself.",
      "The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.",
      "Papa wants us to be married, he continued, after sipping some of the liquid.",
      "And he knows your papa wouldn t let us marry now; and he s afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you shall return home next day, and take me with you.",
      "Take you with her, pitiful changeling!",
      "_You_ marry?",
      "Why, the man is mad!",
      "or he thinks us fools, every one.",
      "And do you imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you?",
      "Are you cherishing the notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband?",
      "You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks: and don t look so silly, now!",
      "I ve a very good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile conceit.",
      "I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me.",
      "Stay all night?",
      "No, she said, looking slowly round.",
      "Ellen, I ll burn that door down but I ll get out.",
      "And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again.",
      "He clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing: Won t you have me, and save me?",
      "not let me come to the Grange?",
      "Oh, darling Catherine!",
      "you mustn t go and leave, after all.",
      "You _must_ obey my father you _must_!",
      "I must obey my own, she replied, and relieve him from this cruel suspense.",
      "The whole night!",
      "What would he think?",
      "He ll be distressed already.",
      "I ll either break or burn a way out of the house.",
      "Be quiet!",
      "You re in no danger; but if you hinder me Linton, I love papa better than you!",
      "The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff s anger restored to the boy his coward s eloquence.",
      "Catherine was near distraught: still, she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, persuading him to subdue his selfish agony.",
      "While they were thus occupied, our jailor re-entered.",
      "Your beasts have trotted off, he said, and now Linton!",
      "snivelling again?",
      "What has she been doing to you?",
      "Come, come have done, and get to bed.",
      "In a month or two, my lad, you ll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand.",
      "You re pining for pure love, are you not?",
      "nothing else in the world: and she shall have you!",
      "There, to bed!",
      "Zillah won t be here to-night; you must undress yourself.",
      "hold your noise!",
      "Once in your own room, I ll not come near you: you needn t fear.",
      "By chance, you ve managed tolerably.",
      "I ll look to the rest.",
      "He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.",
      "The lock was re-secured.",
      "Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent.",
      "Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.",
      "Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness, but he scowled on her and muttered Oh!",
      "you are not afraid of me?",
      "Your courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!",
      "I _am_ afraid now, she replied, because, if I stay, papa will be miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable when he when he Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home!",
      "I promise to marry Linton: papa would like me to: and I love him.",
      "Why should you wish to force me to do what I ll willingly do of myself?",
      "Let him dare to force you, I cried.",
      "There s law in the land, thank God!",
      "there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.",
      "I d inform if he were my own son: and it s felony without benefit of clergy!",
      "said the ruffian.",
      "To the devil with your clamour!",
      "I don t want _you_ to speak.",
      "Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for satisfaction.",
      "You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me that such an event would follow.",
      "As to your promise to marry Linton, I ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.",
      "Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I m safe!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly.",
      "Or marry me now.",
      "Poor papa!",
      "Ellen, he ll think we re lost.",
      "What shall we do?",
      "Not he!",
      "He ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a little amusement, answered Heathcliff.",
      "You cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary.",
      "And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man _only_ your father.",
      "Catherine, his happiest days were over when your days began.",
      "He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went out of it.",
      "I d join him.",
      "I don t love you!",
      "How should I?",
      "Weep away.",
      "As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he may.",
      "His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly.",
      "In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when he got her.",
      "Careful and kind that s paternal.",
      "But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.",
      "Linton can play the little tyrant well.",
      "He ll undertake to torture any number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.",
      "You ll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure you.",
      "You re right there!",
      "I said; explain your son s character.",
      "Show his resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice!",
      "I don t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now, he answered; because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till your master dies.",
      "I can detain you both, quite concealed, here.",
      "If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you ll have an opportunity of judging!",
      "I ll not retract my word, said Catherine.",
      "I ll marry him within this hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, you re a cruel man, but you re not a fiend; and you won t, from _mere_ malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness.",
      "If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live?",
      "I ve given over crying: but I m going to kneel here, at your knee; and I ll not get up, and I ll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me!",
      "No, don t turn away!",
      "_do_ look!",
      "you ll see nothing to provoke you.",
      "I don t hate you.",
      "I m not angry that you struck me.",
      "Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle?",
      "_never_?",
      "you must look once.",
      "I m so wretched, you can t help being sorry and pitying me.",
      "Keep your eft s fingers off; and move, or I ll kick you!",
      "cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her.",
      "I d rather be hugged by a snake.",
      "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?",
      "I _detest_ you!",
      "He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse.",
      "But I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.",
      "It was growing dark we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.",
      "Our host hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not.",
      "There was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.",
      "I thought it had been your cousin Hareton, I observed to Catherine.",
      "I wish he would arrive!",
      "Who knows but he might take our part?",
      "It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange, said Heathcliff, overhearing me.",
      "You should have opened a lattice and called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn t. She s glad to be obliged to stay, I m certain.",
      "At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o clock.",
      "Then he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah s chamber; and I whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.",
      "The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.",
      "We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.",
      "I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes of my employers sprang.",
      "It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.",
      "At seven o clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.",
      "She ran to the door immediately, and answered, Yes.",
      "Here, then, he said, opening it, and pulling her out.",
      "I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again.",
      "I demanded my release.",
      "Be patient, he replied; I ll send up your breakfast in a while.",
      "I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine asked why I was still shut up?",
      "He answered, I must try to endure it another hour, and they went away.",
      "I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff s. I ve brought you something to eat, said a voice; oppen t door!",
      "Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day.",
      "Tak it, he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.",
      "Stay one minute, I began.",
      "Nay, cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to detain him.",
      "And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night; and another, and another.",
      "Five nights and four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion.",
      "CHAPTER XXVIII On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step approached lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the room.",
      "It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.",
      "Eh, dear!",
      "Mrs. Dean!",
      "there is a talk about you at Gimmerton.",
      "I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you d been found, and he d lodged you here!",
      "and you must have got on an island, sure?",
      "And how long were you in the hole?",
      "Did master save you, Mrs. Dean?",
      "But you re not so thin you ve not been so poorly, have you?",
      "Your master is a true scoundrel!",
      "But he shall answer for it.",
      "He needn t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!",
      "asked Zillah.",
      "It s not his tale: they tell that in the village about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw, when I come in Eh, they s queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I went off.",
      "It s a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly Dean.",
      "He stared.",
      "I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the rumour.",
      "The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said, If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah.",
      "Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room.",
      "You can tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key.",
      "The bog-water got into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed her till she came round to her senses.",
      "You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire s funeral.",
      "Mr. Edgar is not dead?",
      "I gasped.",
      "Zillah, Zillah!",
      "No, no; sit you down, my good mistress, she replied; you re right sickly yet.",
      "He s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another day.",
      "I met him on the road and asked.",
      "Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened below, for the way was free.",
      "On entering the house, I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine.",
      "The place was filled with sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.",
      "As I hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth.",
      "Linton lay on the settle, sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes.",
      "I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, alone.",
      "He sucked on like an innocent.",
      "Is she gone?",
      "No, he replied; she s upstairs: she s not to go; we won t let her.",
      "You won t let her, little idiot!",
      "Direct me to her room immediately, or I ll make you sing out sharply.",
      "Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there, he answered.",
      "He says I m not to be soft with Catherine: she s my wife, and it s shameful that she should wish to leave me.",
      "He says she hates me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan t have it: and she shan t go home!",
      "She never shall!",
      "she may cry, and be sick as much as she pleases!",
      "He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to drop asleep.",
      "Master Heathcliff, I resumed, have you forgotten all Catherine s kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through wind and snow to see you?",
      "She wept to miss one evening, because you would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you know he detests you both.",
      "And you join him against her.",
      "That s fine gratitude, is it not?",
      "The corner of Linton s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his lips.",
      "Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?",
      "Think for yourself!",
      "As to your money, she does not even know that you will have any.",
      "And you say she s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up there in a strange house!",
      "_You_ who have felt what it is to be so neglected!",
      "You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too; but you won t pity hers!",
      "I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see an elderly woman, and a servant merely and you, after pretending such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease.",
      "you re a heartless, selfish boy!",
      "I can t stay with her, he answered crossly.",
      "I ll not stay by myself.",
      "She cries so I can t bear it.",
      "And she won t give over, though I say I ll call my father.",
      "I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn t sleep.",
      "Is Mr. Heathcliff out?",
      "I inquired, perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin s mental tortures.",
      "He s in the court, he replied, talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says uncle is dying, truly, at last.",
      "I m glad, for I shall be master of the Grange after him.",
      "Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house.",
      "It isn t hers!",
      "It s mine: papa says everything she has is mine.",
      "All her nice books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine.",
      "And then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on the other uncle, when they were young.",
      "That was yesterday I said _they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her.",
      "The spiteful thing wouldn t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.",
      "I shrieked out that frightens her she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and divided the case, and gave me her mother s portrait; the other she attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained it.",
      "He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me; she refused, and he he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot.",
      "And were you pleased to see her struck?",
      "I asked: having my designs in encouraging his talk.",
      "I winked, he answered: I wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse, he does it so hard.",
      "Yet I was glad at first she deserved punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can t speak for pain.",
      "I don t like to think so; but she s a naughty thing for crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I m afraid of her.",
      "And you can get the key if you choose?",
      "Yes, when I am upstairs, he answered; but I can t walk upstairs now.",
      "In what apartment is it?",
      "Oh, he cried, I shan t tell _you_ where it is.",
      "It is our secret.",
      "Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.",
      "you ve tired me go away, go away!",
      "And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again.",
      "I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a rescue for my young lady from the Grange.",
      "On reaching it, the astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar s door: but I bespoke the announcement of it myself.",
      "How changed I found him, even in those few days!",
      "He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting his death.",
      "Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least.",
      "He thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name.",
      "I touched his hand, and spoke.",
      "Catherine is coming, dear master!",
      "I whispered; she is alive and well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.",
      "I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up, looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.",
      "As soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at the Heights.",
      "I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite true.",
      "I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe all his father s brutal conduct my intentions being to add no bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.",
      "He divined that one of his enemy s purposes was to secure the personal property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.",
      "However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving Catherine s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she had any, after her.",
      "By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.",
      "Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of her jailor.",
      "Both parties were delayed very late.",
      "The single servant returned first.",
      "He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.",
      "The four men came back unaccompanied also.",
      "They brought word that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see her.",
      "I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us.",
      "Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!",
      "Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.",
      "I had gone downstairs at three o clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump.",
      "it is Green, I said, recollecting myself only Green, and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.",
      "I put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.",
      "The harvest moon shone clear outside.",
      "It was not the attorney.",
      "My own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, Ellen, Ellen!",
      "Is papa alive?",
      "Yes, I cried: yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with us again!",
      "She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton s room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.",
      "Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff.",
      "She stared, but soon comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me she would not complain.",
      "I couldn t abide to be present at their meeting.",
      "I stood outside the chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed, then.",
      "All was composed, however: Catherine s despair was as silent as her father s joy.",
      "She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.",
      "He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.",
      "Kissing her cheek, he murmured, I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!",
      "and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.",
      "None could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a struggle.",
      "Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.",
      "It was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave.",
      "He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master s summons.",
      "Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs crossed the latter s mind, to disturb him, after his daughter s arrival.",
      "Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place.",
      "He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.",
      "He would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his family.",
      "There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions.",
      "The funeral was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to stay at the Grange till her father s corpse had quitted it.",
      "She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk of liberating her.",
      "She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff s answer.",
      "It drove her desperate.",
      "Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.",
      "He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once.",
      "Catherine stole out before break of day.",
      "She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother s, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree close by.",
      "Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.",
      "CHAPTER XXIX The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the library; now musing mournfully one of us despairingly on our loss, now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.",
      "We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.",
      "That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a servant one of the discarded ones, not yet departed rushed hastily in, and said that devil Heathcliff was coming through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?",
      "If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.",
      "He made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and availed himself of the master s privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word.",
      "The sound of our informant s voice directed him to the library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.",
      "It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn landscape lay outside.",
      "We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.",
      "Heathcliff advanced to the hearth.",
      "Time had little altered his person either.",
      "There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.",
      "Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.",
      "he said, arresting her by the arm.",
      "No more runnings away!",
      "Where would you go?",
      "I m come to fetch you home; and I hope you ll be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.",
      "I was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business: he s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you ll see by his look that he has received his due!",
      "I brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him afterwards.",
      "I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.",
      "In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me often, though I am not near.",
      "Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.",
      "Why not let Catherine continue here, I pleaded, and send Master Linton to her?",
      "As you hate them both, you d not miss them: they _can_ only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.",
      "I m seeking a tenant for the Grange, he answered; and I want my children about me, to be sure.",
      "Besides, that lass owes me her services for her bread.",
      "I m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after Linton is gone.",
      "Make haste and get ready, now; and don t oblige me to compel you.",
      "I shall, said Catherine.",
      "Linton is all I have to love in the world, and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other.",
      "And I defy you to hurt him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!",
      "You are a boastful champion, replied Heathcliff; but I don t like you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment, as long as it lasts.",
      "It is not I who will make him hateful to you it is his own sweet spirit.",
      "He s as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences: don t expect thanks for this noble devotion.",
      "I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.",
      "I know he has a bad nature, said Catherine: he s your son.",
      "But I m glad I ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that reason I love him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.",
      "You _are_ miserable, are you not?",
      "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
      "_Nobody_ loves you _nobody_ will cry for you when you die!",
      "I wouldn t be you!",
      "Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.",
      "You shall be sorry to be yourself presently, said her father-in-law, if you stand there another minute.",
      "Begone, witch, and get your things!",
      "She scornfully withdrew.",
      "In her absence I began to beg for Zillah s place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer it on no account.",
      "He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.",
      "Having studied Mrs. Linton s, he said I shall have that home.",
      "Not because I need it, but He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile I ll tell you what I did yesterday!",
      "I got the sexton, who was digging Linton s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it.",
      "I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again it is hers yet!",
      "he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton s side, damn him!",
      "I wish he d been soldered in lead.",
      "And I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I m laid there, and slide mine out too; I ll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us he ll not know which is which!",
      "You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "I exclaimed; were you not ashamed to disturb the dead?",
      "I disturbed nobody, Nelly, he replied; and I gave some ease to myself.",
      "I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you ll have a better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there.",
      "Disturbed her?",
      "she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen years incessantly remorselessly till yesternight; and yesternight I was tranquil.",
      "I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.",
      "And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have dreamt of then?",
      "Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!",
      "Do you suppose I dread any change of that sort?",
      "I expected such a transformation on raising the lid, but I m better pleased that it should not commence till I share it.",
      "Besides, unless I had received a distinct impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly have been removed.",
      "It began oddly.",
      "You know I was wild after she died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!",
      "I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and do, exist among us!",
      "The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow.",
      "In the evening I went to the churchyard.",
      "It blew bleak as winter all round was solitary.",
      "I didn t fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them there.",
      "Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us, I said to myself I ll have her in my arms again!",
      "If she be cold, I ll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.",
      "I got a spade from the tool-house, and began to delve with all my might it scraped the coffin; I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down.",
      "If I can only get this off, I muttered, I wish they may shovel in the earth over us both!",
      "and I wrenched at it more desperately still.",
      "There was another sigh, close at my ear.",
      "I appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind.",
      "I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.",
      "A sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.",
      "I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.",
      "Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home.",
      "You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her there.",
      "I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.",
      "Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.",
      "It was fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance.",
      "I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying upstairs, to my room and hers.",
      "I looked round impatiently I felt her by me I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!",
      "I ought to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!",
      "I had not one.",
      "She showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!",
      "And, since then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I ve been the sport of that intolerable torture!",
      "Infernal!",
      "keeping my nerves at such a stretch that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton s. When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in.",
      "When I went from home I hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!",
      "And when I slept in her chamber I was beaten out of that.",
      "I couldn t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to see.",
      "And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night to be always disappointed!",
      "It racked me!",
      "I ve often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me.",
      "Now, since I ve seen her, I m pacified a little.",
      "It was a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.",
      "He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.",
      "I didn t like to hear him talk!",
      "After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be saddled.",
      "Send that over to-morrow, said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her, he added: You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own feet will serve you.",
      "Come along.",
      "Good-bye, Ellen!",
      "whispered my dear little mistress.",
      "As she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.",
      "Come and see me, Ellen; don t forget.",
      "Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!",
      "said her new father.",
      "When I wish to speak to you I ll come here.",
      "I want none of your prying at my house!",
      "He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart, she obeyed.",
      "I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.",
      "Heathcliff fixed Catherine s arm under his: though she disputed the act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley, whose trees concealed them.",
      "CHAPTER XXX I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her, and wouldn t let me pass.",
      "He said Mrs. Linton was thrang, and the master was not in.",
      "Zillah has told me something of the way they go on, otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.",
      "She thinks Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.",
      "My young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded, selfish woman.",
      "Catherine evinced a child s annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.",
      "I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.",
      "The first thing Mrs. Linton did, she said, on her arrival at the Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton s room, and remained till morning.",
      "Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for?",
      "her cousin was very ill. We know that!",
      "answered Heathcliff; but his life is not worth a farthing, and I won t spend a farthing on him.",
      "But I cannot tell how to do, she said; and if nobody will help me, he ll die!",
      "Walk out of the room, cried the master, and let me never hear a word more about him!",
      "None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.",
      "Then she began to bother me, and I said I d had enough plague with the tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton: Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.",
      "How they managed together, I can t tell.",
      "I fancy he fretted a great deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.",
      "She sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle.",
      "Once or twice, after we had gone to bed, I ve happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs -top; and then I ve shut myself in quick, for fear of being moved to interfere.",
      "I did pity her then, I m sure: still I didn t wish to lose my place, you know.",
      "At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me out of my wits, by saying, Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying I m sure he is, this time.",
      "Get up, instantly, and tell him.",
      "Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.",
      "I lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling.",
      "Nothing stirred the house was quiet.",
      "She s mistaken, I said to myself.",
      "He s got over it.",
      "I needn t disturb them; and I began to doze.",
      "But my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the bell the only bell we have, put up on purpose for Linton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and inform them that he wouldn t have that noise repeated.",
      "I delivered Catherine s message.",
      "He cursed to himself, and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room.",
      "I followed.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands folded on her knees.",
      "Her father-in-law went up, held the light to Linton s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to her.",
      "Now Catherine, he said, how do you feel?",
      "She was dumb.",
      "How do you feel, Catherine?",
      "he repeated.",
      "He s safe, and I m free, she answered: I should feel well but, she continued, with a bitterness she couldn t conceal, you have left me so long to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death!",
      "I feel like death!",
      "And she looked like it, too!",
      "I gave her a little wine.",
      "Hareton and Joseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and heard our talk from outside, now entered.",
      "Joseph was fain, I believe, of the lad s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.",
      "But the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn t want his help.",
      "He afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to return to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.",
      "In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at which I hardly wondered.",
      "I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he replied, Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and then to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell me.",
      "Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.",
      "Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton s will.",
      "He had bequeathed the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during her week s absence, when his uncle died.",
      "The lands, being a minor, he could not meddle with.",
      "However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his wife s right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.",
      "Nobody, said Zillah, ever approached her door, except that once, but I; and nobody asked anything about her.",
      "The first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.",
      "She had cried out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn t bear any longer being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn t hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff s horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker: she couldn t comb them out.",
      "Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays: the kirk, (you know, has no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists or Baptists place, I can t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)",
      "Joseph had gone, she continued, but I thought proper to bide at home.",
      "Young folks are always the better for an elder s over-looking; and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn t a model of nice behaviour.",
      "I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.",
      "He coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.",
      "The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.",
      "I saw he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.",
      "He grew sullen, and began to swear.",
      "Now, Mrs. Dean, Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner, you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen you re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg lower.",
      "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her, now?",
      "She s as poor as you or I: poorer, I ll be bound: you re saving, and I m doing my little all that road.",
      "Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper s account.",
      "Missis walked in, she said, as chill as an icicle, and as high as a princess.",
      "I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.",
      "No, she turned up her nose at my civility.",
      "Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.",
      "I ve been starved a month and more, she answered, resting on the word as scornful as she could.",
      "And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both of us.",
      "Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.",
      "Her cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that came to hand.",
      "That was a great advance for the lad.",
      "She didn t thank him; still, he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book.",
      "She continued reading, or seeking for something to read.",
      "His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn t see, and she couldn t see him.",
      "And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird.",
      "He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a taking.",
      "Get away this moment!",
      "How dare you touch me?",
      "Why are you stopping there?",
      "she cried, in a tone of disgust.",
      "I can t endure you!",
      "I ll go upstairs again, if you come near me.",
      "Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.",
      "Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?",
      "I m stalled of doing naught; and I do like I could like to hear her!",
      "Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask of yourseln.",
      "Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma am, I said, immediately.",
      "He d take it very kind he d be much obliged.",
      "She frowned; and looking up, answered Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to understand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer!",
      "I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you!",
      "When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of your faces, you all kept off.",
      "But I won t complain to you!",
      "I m driven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.",
      "What could I ha done?",
      "began Earnshaw.",
      "How was I to blame?",
      "you are an exception, answered Mrs. Heathcliff.",
      "I never missed such a concern as you.",
      "But I offered more than once, and asked, he said, kindling up at her pertness, I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you Be silent!",
      "I ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear!",
      "said my lady.",
      "Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him!",
      "and unslinging his gun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.",
      "He talked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to condescend to our company, more and more.",
      "However, I took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she ll curl back without respect of any one.",
      "She ll snap at the master himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.",
      "At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my situation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me: but Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton in an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange.",
      "* * * * * Thus ended Mrs. Dean s story.",
      "Notwithstanding the doctor s prophecy, I am rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another tenant to take the place after October.",
      "I would not pass another winter here for much.",
      "CHAPTER XXXI Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.",
      "I went to the Heights as I proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request.",
      "The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.",
      "The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.",
      "I took particular notice of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.",
      "I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?",
      "He answered, No; but he would be in at dinner-time.",
      "It was eleven o clock, and I announced my intention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute for the host.",
      "We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first.",
      "She hardly raised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.",
      "She does not seem so amiable, I thought, as Mrs. Dean would persuade me to believe.",
      "She s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.",
      "Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.",
      "Remove them yourself, she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.",
      "I approached her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean s note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton but she asked aloud, What is that?",
      "And chucked it off.",
      "A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange, I answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it should be imagined a missive of my own.",
      "She would gladly have gathered it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.",
      "Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.",
      "Catherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy: I should like to be riding Minny down there!",
      "I should like to be climbing up there!",
      "I m tired I m _stalled_, Hareton!",
      "And she leant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor knowing whether we remarked her.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, I said, after sitting some time mute, you are not aware that I am an acquaintance of yours?",
      "so intimate that I think it strange you won t come and speak to me.",
      "My housekeeper never wearies of talking about and praising you; and she ll be greatly disappointed if I return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter and said nothing!",
      "She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked, Does Ellen like you?",
      "Yes, very well, I replied, hesitatingly.",
      "You must tell her, she continued, that I would answer her letter, but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear a leaf.",
      "No books!",
      "How do you contrive to live here without them?",
      "if I may take the liberty to inquire.",
      "Though provided with a large library, I m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and I should be desperate!",
      "I was always reading, when I had them, said Catherine; and Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.",
      "I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.",
      "Only once, I searched through Joseph s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room some Latin and Greek, and some tales and poetry: all old friends.",
      "I brought the last here and you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of stealing!",
      "They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.",
      "Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?",
      "But I ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!",
      "Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her accusations.",
      "Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge, I said, coming to his rescue.",
      "He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your attainments.",
      "He ll be a clever scholar in a few years.",
      "And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime, answered Catherine.",
      "Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders he makes!",
      "I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it was extremely funny.",
      "I heard you; and I heard you turning over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you couldn t read their explanations!",
      "The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.",
      "I had a similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean s anecdote of his first attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I observed, But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.",
      "she replied, I don t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations!",
      "Those books, both prose and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have them debased and profaned in his mouth!",
      "Besides, of all, he has selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of deliberate malice.",
      "Hareton s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.",
      "I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.",
      "He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into Catherine s lap, exclaiming, Take them!",
      "I never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!",
      "I won t have them now, she answered.",
      "I shall connect them with you, and hate them.",
      "She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it from her.",
      "And listen, she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse of an old ballad in the same fashion.",
      "But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.",
      "The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin s sensitive though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.",
      "He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.",
      "I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.",
      "I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies also.",
      "He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.",
      "Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the contrary result.",
      "Yes, that s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!",
      "cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration with indignant eyes.",
      "You d _better_ hold your tongue, now, he answered fiercely.",
      "And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the entrance, where I made way for him to pass.",
      "But ere he had crossed the door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and laying hold of his shoulder asked, What s to do now, my lad?",
      "Naught, naught, he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in solitude.",
      "Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.",
      "It will be odd if I thwart myself, he muttered, unconscious that I was behind him.",
      "But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_ every day more!",
      "How the devil is he so like?",
      "I can hardly bear to see him.",
      "He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.",
      "There was a restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked there before; and he looked sparer in person.",
      "His daughter-in-law, on perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so that I remained alone.",
      "I m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood, he said, in reply to my greeting; from selfish motives partly: I don t think I could readily supply your loss in this desolation.",
      "I ve wondered more than once what brought you here.",
      "An idle whim, I fear, sir, was my answer; or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away.",
      "I shall set out for London next week; and I must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.",
      "I believe I shall not live there any more.",
      "Oh, indeed; you re tired of being banished from the world, are you?",
      "But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from any one.",
      "I m coming to plead off nothing about it, I exclaimed, considerably irritated.",
      "Should you wish it, I ll settle with you now, and I drew my note-book from my pocket.",
      "No, no, he replied, coolly; you ll leave sufficient behind to cover your debts, if you fail to return: I m not in such a hurry.",
      "Sit down and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit can generally be made welcome.",
      "bring the things in: where are you?",
      "Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.",
      "You may get your dinner with Joseph, muttered Heathcliff, aside, and remain in the kitchen till he is gone.",
      "She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation to transgress.",
      "Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.",
      "With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton, absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade adieu early.",
      "I would have departed by the back way, to get a last glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could not fulfil my wish.",
      "How dreary life gets over in that house!",
      "I reflected, while riding down the road.",
      "What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into the stirring atmosphere of the town!",
      "CHAPTER XXXII 1802.",
      "This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within fifteen miles of Gimmerton.",
      "The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked, Yon s frough Gimmerton, nah!",
      "They re allas three wick after other folk wi ther harvest.",
      "Gimmerton?",
      "I repeated my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy.",
      "I know.",
      "How far is it from this?",
      "Happen fourteen mile o er th hills; and a rough road, he answered.",
      "A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.",
      "It was scarcely noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own roof as in an inn.",
      "Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading the neighbourhood again.",
      "Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we managed the distance in some three hours.",
      "I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.",
      "The grey church looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.",
      "I distinguished a moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.",
      "It was sweet, warm weather too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer August, I m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its solitudes.",
      "In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.",
      "I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.",
      "I rode into the court.",
      "Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.",
      "Is Mrs. Dean within?",
      "I demanded of the dame.",
      "Mistress Dean?",
      "Nay!",
      "she answered, she doesn t bide here: shoo s up at th Heights.",
      "Are you the housekeeper, then?",
      "Eea, Aw keep th hause, she replied.",
      "Well, I m Mr. Lockwood, the master.",
      "Are there any rooms to lodge me in, I wonder?",
      "I wish to stay all night.",
      "T maister!",
      "she cried in astonishment.",
      "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur coming?",
      "Yah sud ha send word.",
      "They s nowt norther dry nor mensful abaht t place: nowt there isn t!",
      "She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.",
      "I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.",
      "No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.",
      "She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.",
      "Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion.",
      "An after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.",
      "All well at the Heights?",
      "I inquired of the woman.",
      "Eea, f r owt ee knaw!",
      "she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot cinders.",
      "I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind, and the mild glory of a rising moon in front one fading, and the other brightening as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road branching off to Mr. Heathcliff s dwelling.",
      "Before I arrived in sight of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by that splendid moon.",
      "I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock it yielded to my hand.",
      "That is an improvement, I thought.",
      "And I noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.",
      "Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.",
      "But the house of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.",
      "I could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.",
      "Con-_trary_!",
      "said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.",
      "That for the third time, you dunce!",
      "I m not going to tell you again.",
      "Recollect, or I ll pull your hair!",
      "Contrary, then, answered another, in deep but softened tones.",
      "And now, kiss me, for minding so well.",
      "No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.",
      "The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed and seated at a table, having a book before him.",
      "His handsome features glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention.",
      "Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to superintend his studies; and her face it was lucky he could not see her face, or he would never have been so steady.",
      "I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides staring at its smiting beauty.",
      "The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he generously returned.",
      "Then they came to the door, and from their conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the moors.",
      "I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw s heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.",
      "There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.",
      "I d rayther, by th haulf, hev em swearing i my lugs fro h morn to neeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!",
      "said the tenant of the kitchen, in answer to an unheard speech of Nelly s. It s a blazing shame, that I cannot oppen t blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and all t flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th warld!",
      "ye re a raight nowt; and shoo s another; and that poor lad ll be lost atween ye.",
      "he added, with a groan; he s witched: I m sartin on t. Oh, Lord, judge em, for there s norther law nor justice among wer rullers!",
      "or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose, retorted the singer.",
      "But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and never mind me.",
      "This is Fairy Annie s Wedding a bonny tune it goes to a dance.",
      "Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me directly, she jumped to her feet, crying Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!",
      "How could you think of returning in this way?",
      "All s shut up at Thrushcross Grange.",
      "You should have given us notice!",
      "I ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay, I answered.",
      "I depart again to-morrow.",
      "And how are you transplanted here, Mrs. Dean?",
      "tell me that.",
      "Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went to London, and stay till you returned.",
      "But, step in, pray!",
      "Have you walked from Gimmerton this evening?",
      "From the Grange, I replied; and while they make me lodging room there, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don t think of having another opportunity in a hurry.",
      "What business, sir?",
      "said Nelly, conducting me into the house.",
      "He s gone out at present, and won t return soon.",
      "About the rent, I answered.",
      "then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle, she observed; or rather with me.",
      "She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act for her: there s nobody else.",
      "I looked surprised.",
      "you have not heard of Heathcliff s death, I see, she continued.",
      "Heathcliff dead!",
      "How long ago?",
      "Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I ll tell you all about it.",
      "Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?",
      "I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.",
      "You sit down too.",
      "I never dreamt of his dying!",
      "Let me hear how it came to pass.",
      "You say you don t expect them back for some time the young people?",
      "No I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they don t care for me.",
      "At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you good: you seem weary.",
      "She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking whether it warn t a crying scandal that she should have followers at her time of life?",
      "And then, to get them jocks out o t maister s cellar!",
      "He fair shaamed to bide still and see it.",
      "She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.",
      "And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff s history.",
      "He had a queer end, as she expressed it.",
      "* * * * * I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine s sake.",
      "My first interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since our separation.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my sitting-room, and keep her with me.",
      "It was enough if he were obliged to see her once or twice a day.",
      "She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we should get on in tolerable comfort.",
      "The delusion did not last long.",
      "Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and restless.",
      "For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.",
      "I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him and though he was always as sullen and silent as possible after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he lived how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and dozing.",
      "He s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?",
      "she once observed, or a cart-horse?",
      "He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally!",
      "What a blank, dreary mind he must have!",
      "Do you ever dream, Hareton?",
      "And, if you do, what is it about?",
      "But you can t speak to me!",
      "Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look again.",
      "He s, perhaps, dreaming now, she continued.",
      "He twitched his shoulder as Juno twitches hers.",
      "Ask him, Ellen.",
      "Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don t behave!",
      "He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his fist, as if tempted to use it.",
      "I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen, she exclaimed, on another occasion.",
      "He is afraid I shall laugh at him.",
      "Ellen, what do you think?",
      "He began to teach himself to read once; and, because I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a fool?",
      "Were not you naughty?",
      "I said; answer me that.",
      "Perhaps I was, she went on; but I did not expect him to be so silly.",
      "Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?",
      "I ll try!",
      "She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.",
      "Well, I shall put it here, she said, in the table-drawer; and I m going to bed.",
      "Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.",
      "But he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her great disappointment.",
      "I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off improving himself: she had done it effectually.",
      "But her ingenuity was at work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.",
      "When Hareton was there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.",
      "On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was useless.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost banished Earnshaw from his apartment.",
      "Owing to an accident at the commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.",
      "His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.",
      "The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again.",
      "It suited Catherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room upstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might accompany me.",
      "On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.",
      "Earnshaw sat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was beguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.",
      "At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to the hearthstone.",
      "I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin I ve found out, Hareton, that I want that I m glad that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.",
      "Hareton returned no answer.",
      "Hareton, Hareton, Hareton!",
      "she continued.",
      "Get off wi ye!",
      "he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.",
      "Let me take that pipe, she said, cautiously advancing her hand and abstracting it from his mouth.",
      "Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the fire.",
      "He swore at her and seized another.",
      "Stop, she cried, you must listen to me first; and I can t speak while those clouds are floating in my face.",
      "Will you go to the devil!",
      "he exclaimed, ferociously, and let me be!",
      "No, she persisted, I won t: I can t tell what to do to make you talk to me; and you are determined not to understand.",
      "When I call you stupid, I don t mean anything: I don t mean that I despise you.",
      "Come, you shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.",
      "I shall have naught to do wi you and your mucky pride, and your damned mocking tricks!",
      "I ll go to hell, body and soul, before I look sideways after you again.",
      "Side out o t gate, now, this minute!",
      "Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency to sob.",
      "You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton, I interrupted, since she repents of her sauciness.",
      "It would do you a great deal of good: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.",
      "A companion!",
      "he cried; when she hates me, and does not think me fit to wipe her shoon!",
      "Nay, if it made me a king, I d not be scorned for seeking her good-will any more.",
      "It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!",
      "wept Cathy, no longer disguising her trouble.",
      "You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and more.",
      "You re a damned liar, began Earnshaw: why have I made him angry, by taking your part, then, a hundred times?",
      "and that when you sneered at and despised me, and Go on plaguing me, and I ll step in yonder, and say you worried me out of the kitchen!",
      "I didn t know you took my part, she answered, drying her eyes; and I was miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you to forgive me: what can I do besides?",
      "She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.",
      "He blackened and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground.",
      "Catherine, by instinct, must have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.",
      "The little rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the window, quite demurely.",
      "I shook my head reprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered Well!",
      "what should I have done, Ellen?",
      "He wouldn t shake hands, and he wouldn t look: I must show him some way that I like him that I want to be friends.",
      "Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful, for some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.",
      "Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to Mr. Hareton Earnshaw, she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined recipient.",
      "And tell him, if he ll take it, I ll come and teach him to read it right, she said; and, if he refuse it, I ll go upstairs, and never tease him again.",
      "I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.",
      "Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.",
      "He did not strike it off, either.",
      "I returned to my work.",
      "Catherine leaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her cousin.",
      "He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured petition.",
      "Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.",
      "You can make me so happy by speaking that little word.",
      "He muttered something inaudible.",
      "And you ll be my friend?",
      "added Catherine, interrogatively.",
      "Nay, you ll be ashamed of me every day of your life, he answered; and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.",
      "So you won t be my friend?",
      "she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and creeping close up.",
      "I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.",
      "The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their position had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.",
      "He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder; and confounded at his favourite s endurance of her proximity: it affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.",
      "His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day s transactions.",
      "At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.",
      "Tak these in to t maister, lad, he said, and bide there.",
      "I s gang up to my own rahm.",
      "This hoile s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we mun side out and seearch another.",
      "Come, Catherine, I said, we must side out too: I ve done my ironing.",
      "Are you ready to go?",
      "It is not eight o clock!",
      "she answered, rising unwillingly.",
      "Hareton, I ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I ll bring some more to-morrow.",
      "Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak into th hahse, said Joseph, and it ll be mitch if yah find em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!",
      "Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as she passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture to say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps, during her earliest visits to Linton.",
      "The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary interruptions.",
      "Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their minds tending to the same point one loving and desiring to esteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed they contrived in the end to reach it.",
      "You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff s heart.",
      "But now, I m glad you did not try.",
      "The crown of all my wishes will be the union of those two.",
      "I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there won t be a happier woman than myself in England!",
      "CHAPTER XXXIII On the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his ordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore.",
      "She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy planning together an importation of plants from the Grange.",
      "I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph s eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.",
      "That will be all shown to the master, I exclaimed, the minute it is discovered.",
      "And what excuse have you to offer for taking such liberties with the garden?",
      "We shall have a fine explosion on the head of it: see if we don t!",
      "Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!",
      "I d forgotten they were Joseph s, answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled; but I ll tell him I did it.",
      "We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "I held the mistress s post in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.",
      "Catherine usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I presently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than she had in her hostility.",
      "Now, mind you don t talk with and notice your cousin too much, were my whispered instructions as we entered the room.",
      "It will certainly annoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he ll be mad at you both.",
      "I m not going to, she answered.",
      "The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in his plate of porridge.",
      "He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.",
      "I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.",
      "Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly surveyed our faces.",
      "Catherine met it with her accustomed look of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.",
      "It is well you are out of my reach, he exclaimed.",
      "What fiend possesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?",
      "Down with them!",
      "and don t remind me of your existence again.",
      "I thought I had cured you of laughing.",
      "It was me, muttered Hareton.",
      "demanded the master.",
      "Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast and his interrupted musing.",
      "We had nearly finished, and the two young people prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further disturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door, revealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage committed on his precious shrubs was detected.",
      "He must have seen Cathy and her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws worked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech difficult to understand, he began: I mun hev my wage, and I mun goa!",
      "I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I d sarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I d lug my books up into t garret, and all my bits o stuff, and they sud hev t kitchen to theirseln; for t sake o quietness.",
      "It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I thowt I _could_ do that!",
      "But nah, shoo s taan my garden fro me, and by th heart, maister, I cannot stand it!",
      "Yah may bend to th yoak an ye will I noan used to t, and an old man doesn t sooin get used to new barthens.",
      "I d rayther arn my bite an my sup wi a hammer in th road!",
      "Now, now, idiot!",
      "interrupted Heathcliff, cut it short!",
      "What s your grievance?",
      "I ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.",
      "She may thrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.",
      "It s noan Nelly!",
      "answered Joseph.",
      "I sudn t shift for Nelly nasty ill nowt as shoo is.",
      "Thank God!",
      "_shoo_ cannot stale t sowl o nob dy!",
      "Shoo wer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her bout winking.",
      "It s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that s witched our lad, wi her bold een and her forrard ways till Nay!",
      "it fair brusts my heart!",
      "He s forgotten all I ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a whole row o t grandest currant-trees i t garden!",
      "and here he lamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and Earnshaw s ingratitude and dangerous condition.",
      "Is the fool drunk?",
      "asked Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Hareton, is it you he s finding fault with?",
      "I ve pulled up two or three bushes, replied the young man; but I m going to set em again.",
      "And why have you pulled them up?",
      "said the master.",
      "Catherine wisely put in her tongue.",
      "We wanted to plant some flowers there, she cried.",
      "I m the only person to blame, for I wished him to do it.",
      "And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?",
      "demanded her father-in-law, much surprised.",
      "And who ordered _you_ to obey her?",
      "he added, turning to Hareton.",
      "The latter was speechless; his cousin replied You shouldn t grudge a few yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!",
      "Your land, insolent slut!",
      "You never had any, said Heathcliff.",
      "And my money, she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime biting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.",
      "Get done, and begone!",
      "And Hareton s land, and his money, pursued the reckless thing.",
      "Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!",
      "The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.",
      "If you strike me, Hareton will strike you, she said; so you may as well sit down.",
      "If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I ll strike him to hell, thundered Heathcliff.",
      "Damnable witch!",
      "dare you pretend to rouse him against me?",
      "Off with her!",
      "Fling her into the kitchen!",
      "I ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!",
      "Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.",
      "Drag her away!",
      "he cried, savagely.",
      "Are you staying to talk?",
      "And he approached to execute his own command.",
      "He ll not obey you, wicked man, any more, said Catherine; and he ll soon detest you as much as I do.",
      "Wisht!",
      "muttered the young man, reproachfully; I will not hear you speak so to him.",
      "Have done.",
      "But you won t let him strike me?",
      "Come, then, he whispered earnestly.",
      "It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.",
      "Now, _you_ go!",
      "he said to Earnshaw.",
      "Accursed witch!",
      "this time she has provoked me when I could not bear it; and I ll make her repent it for ever!",
      "He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks, entreating him not to hurt her that once.",
      "Heathcliff s black eyes flashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers relaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed intently in her face.",
      "Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a moment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine, said, with assumed calmness You must learn to avoid putting me in a passion, or I shall really murder you some time!",
      "Go with Mrs. Dean, and keep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears.",
      "As to Hareton Earnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I ll send him seeking his bread where he can get it!",
      "Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.",
      "Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!",
      "Leave me!",
      "I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the other followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.",
      "I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he perceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her.",
      "He spoke to none of us, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should not return before evening.",
      "The two new friends established themselves in the house during his absence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her offering a revelation of her father-in-law s conduct to his father.",
      "He said he wouldn t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the devil, it didn t signify; he would stand by him; and he d rather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her father?",
      "Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could break chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to loosen.",
      "She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don t believe she has ever breathed a syllable, in the latter s hearing, against her oppressor since.",
      "When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as busy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.",
      "I came in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on.",
      "You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal satisfaction.",
      "His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and Catherine s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.",
      "His brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags.",
      "While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master.",
      "He came upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at him.",
      "Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them.",
      "The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.",
      "They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are those of Catherine Earnshaw.",
      "The present Catherine has no other likeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.",
      "With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.",
      "I suppose this resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet.",
      "He took the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he bid me sit still.",
      "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
      "he observed, having brooded a while on the scene he had just witnessed: an absurd termination to my violent exertions?",
      "I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof has vanished!",
      "My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me.",
      "But where is the use?",
      "I don t care for striking: I can t take the trouble to raise my hand!",
      "That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity.",
      "It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.",
      "Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I m in its shadow at present.",
      "I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly remember to eat and drink.",
      "Those two who have left the room are the only objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.",
      "About _her_ I won t speak; and I don t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were invisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations.",
      "_He_ moves me differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I d never see him again!",
      "You ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so, he added, making an effort to smile, if I try to describe the thousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.",
      "But you ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.",
      "Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a human being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have been impossible to have accosted him rationally.",
      "In the first place, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her.",
      "That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me?",
      "and what does not recall her?",
      "I cannot look down to this floor, but her features are shaped in the flags!",
      "In every cloud, in every tree filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day I am surrounded with her image!",
      "The most ordinary faces of men and women my own features mock me with a resemblance.",
      "The entire world is a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her!",
      "Well, Hareton s aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and my anguish But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you know why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no benefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it partly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on together.",
      "I can give them no attention any more.",
      "But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "I said, alarmed at his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark things, and entertaining odd fancies.",
      "He might have had a monomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine.",
      "I shall not know that till it comes, he said; I m only half conscious of it now.",
      "You have no feeling of illness, have you?",
      "No, Nelly, I have not, he answered.",
      "Then you are not afraid of death?",
      "Afraid?",
      "I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment, nor a hope of death.",
      "Why should I?",
      "With my hard constitution and temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head.",
      "And yet I cannot continue in this condition!",
      "I have to remind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat!",
      "And it is like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal idea.",
      "I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it.",
      "They have yearned towards it so long, and so unwaveringly, that I m convinced it _will_ be reached and _soon_ because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment.",
      "My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show.",
      "O God!",
      "It is a long fight; I wish it were over!",
      "He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I was inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell.",
      "I wondered greatly how it would end.",
      "Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by looks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the fact.",
      "You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.",
      "CHAPTER XXXIV For some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.",
      "He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him.",
      "One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and out at the front door.",
      "I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I found he was still away.",
      "We were in April then: the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.",
      "After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the influence of Joseph s complaints.",
      "I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was coming in.",
      "And he spoke to me, she added, with a perplexed countenance.",
      "What did he say?",
      "asked Hareton.",
      "He told me to begone as fast as I could, she answered.",
      "But he looked so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him.",
      "How?",
      "he inquired.",
      "Why, almost bright and cheerful.",
      "No, _almost_ nothing _very much_ excited, and wild, and glad!",
      "Night-walking amuses him, then, I remarked, affecting a careless manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be an every-day spectacle.",
      "I framed an excuse to go in.",
      "Heathcliff stood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole face.",
      "Will you have some breakfast?",
      "You must be hungry, rambling about all night!",
      "I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not like to ask directly.",
      "No, I m not hungry, he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of his good humour.",
      "I felt perplexed: I didn t know whether it were not a proper opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.",
      "I don t think it right to wander out of doors, I observed, instead of being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.",
      "I daresay you ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the matter with you now!",
      "Nothing but what I can bear, he replied; and with the greatest pleasure, provided you ll leave me alone: get in, and don t annoy me.",
      "I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.",
      "Yes!",
      "I reflected to myself, we shall have a fit of illness.",
      "I cannot conceive what he has been doing.",
      "That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.",
      "I ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly, he remarked, in allusion to my morning s speech; and I m ready to do justice to the food you give me.",
      "He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.",
      "He laid them on the table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.",
      "We saw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and Earnshaw said he d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had grieved him some way.",
      "Well, is he coming?",
      "cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.",
      "Nay, he answered; but he s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.",
      "I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same unnatural it was unnatural appearance of joy under his black brows; the same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates a strong thrilling, rather than trembling.",
      "I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?",
      "And I exclaimed Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "You look uncommonly animated.",
      "Where should good news come from to me?",
      "I m animated with hunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.",
      "Your dinner is here, I returned; why won t you get it?",
      "I don t want it now, he muttered, hastily: I ll wait till supper.",
      "And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away from me.",
      "I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to myself.",
      "Is there some new reason for this banishment?",
      "Tell me why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "Where were you last night?",
      "I m not putting the question through idle curiosity, but You are putting the question through very idle curiosity, he interrupted, with a laugh.",
      "Yet I ll answer it.",
      "Last night I was on the threshold of hell.",
      "To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.",
      "I have my eyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!",
      "And now you d better go!",
      "You ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from prying.",
      "Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed than ever.",
      "He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on his solitude; till, at eight o clock, I deemed it proper, though unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.",
      "He was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was turned to the interior gloom.",
      "The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large stones which it could not cover.",
      "I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.",
      "Must I close this?",
      "I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not stir.",
      "The light flashed on his features as I spoke.",
      "Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!",
      "Those deep black eyes!",
      "That smile, and ghastly paleness!",
      "It appeared to me, not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.",
      "Yes, close it, he replied, in his familiar voice.",
      "There, that is pure awkwardness!",
      "Why did you hold the candle horizontally?",
      "Be quick, and bring another.",
      "I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph The master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.",
      "For I dared not go in myself again just then.",
      "Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till morning.",
      "We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he had rather we had no suspicion.",
      "Is he a ghoul or a vampire?",
      "I mused.",
      "I had read of such hideous incarnate demons.",
      "And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to that sense of horror.",
      "But where did he come from, the little dark thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?",
      "muttered Superstition, as I dozed into unconsciousness.",
      "And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word, Heathcliff.",
      "That came true: we were.",
      "If you enter the kirkyard, you ll read, on his headstone, only that, and the date of his death.",
      "Dawn restored me to common sense.",
      "I rose, and went into the garden, as soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his window.",
      "There were none.",
      "He has stayed at home, I thought, and he ll be all right to-day.",
      "I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came down, for he lay late.",
      "They preferred taking it out of doors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.",
      "On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.",
      "He and Joseph were conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more exaggerated.",
      "When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.",
      "He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute together.",
      "Come now, I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, eat and drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.",
      "He didn t notice me, and yet he smiled.",
      "I d rather have seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "master!",
      "I cried, don t, for God s sake, stare as if you saw an unearthly vision.",
      "Don t, for God s sake, shout so loud, he replied.",
      "Turn round, and tell me, are we by ourselves?",
      "Of course, was my answer; of course we are.",
      "Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.",
      "With a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.",
      "Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards distance.",
      "And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.",
      "The fancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.",
      "I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.",
      "I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals?",
      "and saying that on the next occasion I needn t wait: I might set the things down and go.",
      "Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.",
      "The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.",
      "I did not retire to rest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.",
      "He returned after midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room beneath.",
      "I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended.",
      "It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.",
      "I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff s step, restlessly measuring the floor, and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a groan.",
      "He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.",
      "I had not courage to walk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and began to scrape the cinders.",
      "It drew him forth sooner than I expected.",
      "He opened the door immediately, and said Nelly, come here is it morning?",
      "Come in with your light.",
      "It is striking four, I answered.",
      "You want a candle to take upstairs: you might have lit one at this fire.",
      "No, I don t wish to go upstairs, he said.",
      "Come in, and kindle _me_ a fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.",
      "I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any, I replied, getting a chair and the bellows.",
      "He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for common breathing between.",
      "When day breaks I ll send for Green, he said; I wish to make some legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and while I can act calmly.",
      "I have not written my will yet; and how to leave my property I cannot determine.",
      "I wish I could annihilate it from the face of the earth.",
      "I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff, I interposed.",
      "Let your will be a while: you ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet!",
      "I never expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.",
      "The way you ve passed these three last days might knock up a Titan.",
      "Do take some food, and some repose.",
      "You need only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both.",
      "Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.",
      "It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest, he replied.",
      "I assure you it is through no settled designs.",
      "I ll do both, as soon as I possibly can.",
      "But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water rest within arms length of the shore!",
      "I must reach it first, and then I ll rest.",
      "Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices, I ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing.",
      "I m too happy; and yet I m not happy enough.",
      "My soul s bliss kills my body, but does not satisfy itself.",
      "Happy, master?",
      "Strange happiness!",
      "If you would hear me without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you happier.",
      "What is that?",
      "Give it.",
      "You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff, I said, that from the time you were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.",
      "You must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space to search it now.",
      "Could it be hurtful to send for some one some minister of any denomination, it does not matter which to explain it, and show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?",
      "I m rather obliged than angry, Nelly, he said, for you remind me of the manner in which I desire to be buried.",
      "It is to be carried to the churchyard in the evening.",
      "You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins!",
      "No minister need come; nor need anything be said over me.",
      "I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.",
      "And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?",
      "I said, shocked at his godless indifference.",
      "How would you like it?",
      "They won t do that, he replied: if they did, you must have me removed secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the dead are not annihilated!",
      "As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired to his den, and I breathed freer.",
      "But in the afternoon, while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.",
      "I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his companion alone.",
      "I believe you think me a fiend, he said, with his dismal laugh: something too horrible to live under a decent roof.",
      "Then turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he added, half sneeringly, Will _you_ come, chuck?",
      "I ll not hurt you.",
      "to you I ve made myself worse than the devil.",
      "Well, there is _one_ who won t shrink from my company!",
      "she s relentless.",
      "Oh, damn it!",
      "It s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear even mine.",
      "He solicited the society of no one more.",
      "At dusk he went into his chamber.",
      "Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him groaning and murmuring to himself.",
      "Hareton was anxious to enter; but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.",
      "When he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.",
      "He was better, and would be left alone; so the doctor went away.",
      "The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in.",
      "He cannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through.",
      "He must either be up or out.",
      "But I ll make no more ado, I ll go boldly and look.",
      "Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I peeped in.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff was there laid on his back.",
      "His eyes met mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.",
      "I could not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.",
      "The lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could doubt no more: he was dead and stark!",
      "I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful, life-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it.",
      "They would not shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too!",
      "Taken with another fit of cowardice, I cried out for Joseph.",
      "Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but resolutely refused to meddle with him.",
      "Th divil s harried off his soul, he cried, and he may hev his carcass into t bargin, for aught I care!",
      "what a wicked un he looks, girning at death!",
      "and the old sinner grinned in mockery.",
      "I thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their rights.",
      "I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.",
      "But poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.",
      "He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.",
      "He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.",
      "Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.",
      "I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not the cause.",
      "We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.",
      "Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended the whole attendance.",
      "The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered.",
      "Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly.",
      "But the country folks, if you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this house.",
      "Idle tales, you ll say, and so say I.",
      "Yet that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on em looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his death: and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago.",
      "I was going to the Grange one evening a dark evening, threatening thunder and, just at the turn of the Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be guided.",
      "What is the matter, my little man?",
      "There s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t nab, he blubbered, un I darnut pass em.",
      "I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him take the road lower down.",
      "He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents and companions repeat.",
      "Yet, still, I don t like being out in the dark now; and I don t like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.",
      "They are going to the Grange, then?",
      "Yes, answered Mrs. Dean, as soon as they are married, and that will be on New Year s Day.",
      "And who will live here then?",
      "Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him company.",
      "They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.",
      "For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?",
      "No, Mr. Lockwood, said Nelly, shaking her head.",
      "I believe the dead are at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.",
      "At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.",
      "_They_ are afraid of nothing, I grumbled, watching their approach through the window.",
      "Together, they would brave Satan and all his legions.",
      "As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at the moon or, more correctly, at each other by her light I felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door; and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his fellow-servant s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.",
      "My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.",
      "When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and slates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.",
      "I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton s only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff s still bare.",
      "I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth."

      "Letter 1 _To Mrs. Saville, England._ St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17 .",
      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.",
      "I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.",
      "Do you understand this feeling?",
      "This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.",
      "I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.",
      "There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.",
      "There for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.",
      "Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.",
      "What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?",
      "I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.",
      "I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.",
      "These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.",
      "But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.",
      "This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.",
      "I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.",
      "You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas library.",
      "My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.",
      "These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.",
      "I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.",
      "You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.",
      "I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.",
      "I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.",
      "I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage.",
      "Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.",
      "I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.",
      "Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!",
      "My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.",
      "I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.",
      "They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.",
      "The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.",
      "I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",
      "I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return?",
      "Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?",
      "If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.",
      "If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.",
      "Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.",
      "Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.",
      "Your affectionate brother, R. Walton Letter 2 _To Mrs. Saville, England._ Archangel, 28th March, 17 .",
      "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!",
      "Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.",
      "I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",
      "I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.",
      "I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine.",
      "You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.",
      "I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.",
      "How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!",
      "I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.",
      "But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas books of voyages.",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.",
      "Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.",
      "It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.",
      "Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.",
      "My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.",
      "He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.",
      "I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.",
      "This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.",
      "A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.",
      "I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.",
      "This, briefly, is his story.",
      "Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.",
      "He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.",
      "My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.",
      "He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.",
      "But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.",
      "What a noble fellow!",
      "you will exclaim.",
      "He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.",
      "Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.",
      "The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.",
      "I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.",
      "It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart.",
      "I am going to unexplored regions, to the land of mist and snow, but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the Ancient Mariner.",
      "You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret.",
      "I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.",
      "There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand.",
      "I am practically industrious painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore.",
      "But to return to dearer considerations.",
      "Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?",
      "I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.",
      "Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits.",
      "I love you very tenderly.",
      "Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.",
      "Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton Letter 3 _To Mrs. Saville, England._ July 7th, 17 .",
      "My dear Sister, I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe and well advanced on my voyage.",
      "This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.",
      "I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.",
      "We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected.",
      "No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.",
      "One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.",
      "Adieu, my dear Margaret.",
      "Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.",
      "I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.",
      "But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.",
      "Wherefore not?",
      "Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.",
      "Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
      "What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?",
      "My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.",
      "But I must finish.",
      "Heaven bless my beloved sister!",
      "R.W.",
      "Letter 4 _To Mrs. Saville, England._ August 5th, 17 .",
      "So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.",
      "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.",
      "Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.",
      "We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",
      "About two o clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.",
      "Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.",
      "We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.",
      "We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.",
      "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.",
      "We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.",
      "Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.",
      "We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.",
      "I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.",
      "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.",
      "It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.",
      "Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European.",
      "When I appeared on deck the master said, Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.",
      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.",
      "Before I come on board your vessel, said he, will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.",
      "I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.",
      "Good God!",
      "Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.",
      "His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.",
      "I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.",
      "We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.",
      "We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.",
      "As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.",
      "By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.",
      "When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.",
      "I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.",
      "But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",
      "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, To seek one who fled from me.",
      "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
      "Yes.",
      "Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.",
      "This aroused the stranger s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the d mon, as he called him, had pursued.",
      "Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.",
      "Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.",
      "And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.",
      "I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.",
      "He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.",
      "I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.",
      "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.",
      "The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.",
      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.",
      "For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",
      "He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.",
      "I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.",
      "I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.",
      "August 13th, 17 .",
      "My affection for my guest increases every day.",
      "He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.",
      "How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?",
      "He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",
      "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",
      "Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.",
      "He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.",
      "He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.",
      "I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.",
      "One man s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.",
      "As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener s countenance.",
      "At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.",
      "I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: Unhappy man!",
      "Do you share my madness?",
      "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
      "Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!",
      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.",
      "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.",
      "He asked me the history of my earlier years.",
      "The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.",
      "I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",
      "I agree with you, replied the stranger; we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",
      "I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.",
      "You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.",
      "But I I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.",
      "As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.",
      "But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.",
      "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.",
      "The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.",
      "Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",
      "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?",
      "You would not if you saw him.",
      "You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.",
      "Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.",
      "I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
      "August 19th, 17 .",
      "Yesterday the stranger said to me, You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",
      "I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.",
      "You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.",
      "I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.",
      "Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.",
      "Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.",
      "You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.",
      "I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.",
      "I expressed these feelings in my answer.",
      "I thank you, he replied, for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.",
      "I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.",
      "I understand your feeling, continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.",
      "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.",
      "This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.",
      "I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.",
      "If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.",
      "This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!",
      "Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.",
      "Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus!",
      "Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.",
      "My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.",
      "He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.",
      "He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.",
      "One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.",
      "This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.",
      "Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.",
      "My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.",
      "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.",
      "He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.",
      "Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.",
      "But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.",
      "Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant s house.",
      "The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",
      "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.",
      "But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.",
      "She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.",
      "Several months passed in this manner.",
      "Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.",
      "This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.",
      "He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.",
      "Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.",
      "There was a sense of justice in my father s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.",
      "Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.",
      "There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.",
      "Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.",
      "He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.",
      "Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.",
      "During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France.",
      "I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.",
      "I remained for several years their only child.",
      "Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.",
      "My mother s tender caresses and my father s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.",
      "I was their plaything and their idol, and something better their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.",
      "With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.",
      "For a long time I was their only care.",
      "My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.",
      "When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.",
      "Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.",
      "This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.",
      "During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.",
      "One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.",
      "She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.",
      "Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.",
      "She appeared of a different stock.",
      "The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.",
      "Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.",
      "Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.",
      "She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.",
      "Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth.",
      "The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then.",
      "They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.",
      "The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.",
      "He became the victim of its weakness.",
      "Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.",
      "His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.",
      "She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",
      "When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.",
      "The apparition was soon explained.",
      "With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.",
      "They were fond of the sweet orphan.",
      "Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.",
      "They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents house my more than sister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.",
      "Everyone loved Elizabeth.",
      "The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.",
      "On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, I have a pretty present for my Victor tomorrow he shall have it.",
      "And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish.",
      "All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own.",
      "We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.",
      "No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.",
      "Chapter 2 We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.",
      "I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.",
      "Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.",
      "Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.",
      "She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers she found ample scope for admiration and delight.",
      "While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.",
      "The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.",
      "Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.",
      "On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.",
      "We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.",
      "We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.",
      "It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.",
      "I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.",
      "Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.",
      "He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.",
      "He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake.",
      "He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.",
      "He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.",
      "He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.",
      "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.",
      "My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.",
      "We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.",
      "When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.",
      "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.",
      "I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.",
      "It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",
      "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.",
      "The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.",
      "The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.",
      "Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.",
      "She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",
      "And Clerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?",
      "Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.",
      "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",
      "Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",
      "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.",
      "When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.",
      "In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.",
      "I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.",
      "A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.",
      "My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, Ah!",
      "Cornelius Agrippa!",
      "My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.",
      "If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.",
      "It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.",
      "But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.",
      "When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",
      "I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.",
      "I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.",
      "In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.",
      "Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.",
      "Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.",
      "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.",
      "The most learned philosopher knew little more.",
      "He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.",
      "He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.",
      "I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.",
      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.",
      "I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.",
      "It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.",
      "My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child s blindness, added to a student s thirst for knowledge.",
      "Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.",
      "Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!",
      "Nor were these my only visions.",
      "The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",
      "And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",
      "When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.",
      "It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",
      "I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.",
      "As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.",
      "When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.",
      "It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.",
      "I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.",
      "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.",
      "On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.",
      "All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.",
      "It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.",
      "All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.",
      "By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.",
      "In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",
      "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.",
      "When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.",
      "Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.",
      "It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",
      "It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.",
      "Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.",
      "Chapter 3 When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.",
      "I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.",
      "My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",
      "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.",
      "During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.",
      "She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",
      "She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.",
      "On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.",
      "On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.",
      "She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.",
      "My children, she said, my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.",
      "This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.",
      "Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.",
      "Alas!",
      "I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?",
      "But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.",
      "She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",
      "I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",
      "It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.",
      "These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.",
      "Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
      "And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",
      "The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.",
      "My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.",
      "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.",
      "I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.",
      "It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.",
      "I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.",
      "I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",
      "She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.",
      "She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.",
      "She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.",
      "Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.",
      "She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.",
      "The day of my departure at length arrived.",
      "Clerval spent the last evening with us.",
      "He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.",
      "His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.",
      "Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.",
      "He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.",
      "We sat late.",
      "We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word Farewell!",
      "It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",
      "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.",
      "I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure I was now alone.",
      "In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.",
      "My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.",
      "I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were old familiar faces, but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.",
      "Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.",
      "I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.",
      "I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.",
      "Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.",
      "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",
      "At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.",
      "I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.",
      "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.",
      "Chance or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father s door led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.",
      "He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.",
      "He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.",
      "I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.",
      "The professor stared.",
      "Have you, he said, really spent your time in studying such nonsense?",
      "I replied in the affirmative.",
      "Every minute, continued M. Krempe with warmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.",
      "You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.",
      "In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?",
      "I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",
      "My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.",
      "M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.",
      "In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.",
      "As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.",
      "With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.",
      "The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.",
      "I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.",
      "But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",
      "And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",
      "This professor was very unlike his colleague.",
      "He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.",
      "His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.",
      "He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.",
      "After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: The ancient teachers of this science, said he, promised impossibilities and performed nothing.",
      "The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.",
      "They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.",
      "They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.",
      "They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.",
      "Such were the professor s words rather let me say such the words of the fate enounced to destroy me.",
      "As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.",
      "So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
      "I closed not my eyes that night.",
      "My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.",
      "By degrees, after the morning s dawn, sleep came.",
      "I awoke, and my yesternight s thoughts were as a dream.",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.",
      "On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.",
      "His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.",
      "I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.",
      "He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.",
      "He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.",
      "They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",
      "The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.",
      "I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.",
      "I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.",
      "I am happy, said M. Waldman, to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.",
      "Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.",
      "A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.",
      "If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.",
      "He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.",
      "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.",
      "Chapter 4 From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",
      "I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",
      "In M. Waldman I found a true friend.",
      "His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.",
      "In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.",
      "My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.",
      "My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.",
      "Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.",
      "Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.",
      "None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.",
      "In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.",
      "When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.",
      "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",
      "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.",
      "I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.",
      "Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.",
      "To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.",
      "I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.",
      "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.",
      "I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.",
      "Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.",
      "Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.",
      "My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.",
      "I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.",
      "I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.",
      "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",
      "The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.",
      "Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.",
      "After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.",
      "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.",
      "After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.",
      "But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",
      "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.",
      "Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.",
      "I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.",
      "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.",
      "I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.",
      "Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.",
      "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",
      "Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.",
      "I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.",
      "The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.",
      "I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.",
      "Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.",
      "It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.",
      "As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.",
      "After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",
      "Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.",
      "A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.",
      "No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.",
      "Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.",
      "My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.",
      "Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.",
      "One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.",
      "Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?",
      "My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.",
      "It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.",
      "I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.",
      "In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.",
      "The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.",
      "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.",
      "It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",
      "And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.",
      "I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.",
      "You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.",
      "I knew well therefore what would be my father s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",
      "I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.",
      "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.",
      "A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.",
      "I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.",
      "If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.",
      "If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, C sar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",
      "But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",
      "My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.",
      "Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always yielded me supreme delight so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.",
      "The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.",
      "But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",
      "Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.",
      "Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.",
      "Chapter 5 It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.",
      "With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",
      "It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",
      "How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?",
      "His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.",
      "Beautiful!",
      "Great God!",
      "His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",
      "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.",
      "I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",
      "For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.",
      "I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",
      "Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.",
      "At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",
      "But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.",
      "I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.",
      "Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",
      "I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch the miserable monster whom I had created.",
      "He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.",
      "His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",
      "He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.",
      "I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",
      "Oh!",
      "No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.",
      "A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.",
      "I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.",
      "I passed the night wretchedly.",
      "Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",
      "Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",
      "Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",
      "The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.",
      "I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.",
      "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",
      "I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.",
      "My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.",
      "[Coleridge s Ancient Mariner. ]",
      "Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.",
      "Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.",
      "As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.",
      "My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he, how glad I am to see you!",
      "How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!",
      "Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.",
      "I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.",
      "I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.",
      "Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.",
      "You may easily believe, said he, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.",
      "But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.",
      "It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.",
      "Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.",
      "By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.",
      "But, my dear Frankenstein, continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.",
      "You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.",
      "I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.",
      "I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.",
      "I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.",
      "I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",
      "Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.",
      "My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.",
      "I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.",
      "I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.",
      "I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.",
      "I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",
      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.",
      "It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.",
      "I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",
      "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.",
      "My dear Victor, cried he, what, for God s sake, is the matter?",
      "Do not laugh in that manner.",
      "How ill you are!",
      "What is the cause of all this?",
      "Do not ask me, cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; _he_ can tell.",
      "Oh, save me!",
      "Save me!",
      "I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.",
      "Poor Clerval!",
      "What must have been his feelings?",
      "A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",
      "But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.",
      "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.",
      "During all that time Henry was my only nurse.",
      "I afterwards learned that, knowing my father s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.",
      "He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.",
      "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",
      "Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.",
      "I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",
      "It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.",
      "I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",
      "Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, how kind, how very good you are to me.",
      "This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",
      "How shall I ever repay you?",
      "I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.",
      "You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?",
      "I trembled.",
      "One subject!",
      "What could it be?",
      "Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?",
      "Compose yourself, said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.",
      "They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.",
      "Is that all, my dear Henry?",
      "How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?",
      "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.",
      "Chapter 6 Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.",
      "It was from my own Elizabeth: My dearest Cousin, You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.",
      "You are forbidden to write to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.",
      "For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",
      "I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!",
      "I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.",
      "Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.",
      "I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.",
      "Get well and return to us.",
      "You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.",
      "Your father s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",
      "How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!",
      "He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.",
      "He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.",
      "My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.",
      "He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.",
      "I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.",
      "Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.",
      "The blue lake and snow-clad mountains they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.",
      "My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.",
      "Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.",
      "Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?",
      "Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.",
      "Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.",
      "This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.",
      "The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.",
      "Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.",
      "A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.",
      "Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",
      "Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she looked so frank-hearted and happy.",
      "My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.",
      "This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.",
      "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",
      "She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",
      "When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.",
      "Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.",
      "One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",
      "The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.",
      "She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.",
      "Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.",
      "Poor girl!",
      "She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.",
      "Nor was her residence at her mother s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.",
      "The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.",
      "She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.",
      "Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.",
      "She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.",
      "Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.",
      "She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",
      "I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.",
      "I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.",
      "When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.",
      "He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",
      "Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.",
      "The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",
      "Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.",
      "Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.",
      "But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",
      "She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.",
      "I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.",
      "Write, dearest Victor, one line one word will be a blessing to us.",
      "Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.",
      "Adieu!",
      "my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!",
      "Elizabeth Lavenza.",
      "Geneva, March 18th, 17 .",
      "Dear, dear Elizabeth!",
      "I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.",
      "I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.",
      "In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.",
      "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.",
      "In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.",
      "Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.",
      "When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.",
      "Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.",
      "He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.",
      "But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.",
      "M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.",
      "He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.",
      "What could I do?",
      "He meant to please, and he tormented me.",
      "I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.",
      "I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",
      "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",
      "I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",
      "I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",
      "M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",
      "D n the fellow!",
      "cried he; why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.",
      "Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",
      "A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.",
      "Ay, ay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.",
      "Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.",
      "M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",
      "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.",
      "He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.",
      "Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.",
      "The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.",
      "Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",
      "I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.",
      "I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.",
      "Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.",
      "When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.",
      "How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!",
      "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",
      "I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.",
      "My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.",
      "The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",
      "The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",
      "I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.",
      "Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",
      "Excellent friend!",
      "how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.",
      "A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",
      "When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.",
      "A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.",
      "The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.",
      "I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.",
      "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.",
      "The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.",
      "At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",
      "We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",
      "My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.",
      "Chapter 7 On my return, I found the following letter from my father: My dear Victor, You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",
      "But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",
      "What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
      "And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?",
      "Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?",
      "I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.",
      "William is dead!",
      "that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!",
      "Victor, he is murdered!",
      "I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.",
      "Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.",
      "The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.",
      "It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.",
      "We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.",
      "Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",
      "This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.",
      "He was not there.",
      "We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.",
      "About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder s finger was on his neck.",
      "He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.",
      "She was very earnest to see the corpse.",
      "At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, O God!",
      "I have murdered my darling child!",
      "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.",
      "When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.",
      "She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.",
      "This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.",
      "We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!",
      "Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.",
      "She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.",
      "We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?",
      "Your dear mother!",
      "Alas, Victor!",
      "I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",
      "Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.",
      "Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.",
      "Your affectionate and afflicted father, Alphonse Frankenstein.",
      "Geneva, May 12th, 17 .",
      "Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends.",
      "I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.",
      "My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, are you always to be unhappy?",
      "My dear friend, what has happened?",
      "I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.",
      "Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.",
      "I can offer you no consolation, my friend, said he; your disaster is irreparable.",
      "What do you intend to do?",
      "To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.",
      "During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.",
      "Poor William!",
      "said he, dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!",
      "Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!",
      "To die so miserably; to feel the murderer s grasp!",
      "How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!",
      "Poor little fellow!",
      "one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.",
      "The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.",
      "A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.",
      "He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.",
      "Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.",
      "But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",
      "My journey was very melancholy.",
      "At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.",
      "I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.",
      "I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.",
      "How altered every thing might be during that time!",
      "One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.",
      "Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.",
      "I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",
      "I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed.",
      "By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.",
      "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.",
      "I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.",
      "I wept like a child.",
      "Dear mountains!",
      "my own beautiful lake!",
      "how do you welcome your wanderer?",
      "Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.",
      "Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?",
      "I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.",
      "My country, my beloved country!",
      "who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!",
      "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.",
      "Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.",
      "The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.",
      "I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.",
      "The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.",
      "As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.",
      "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.",
      "The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.",
      "It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.",
      "It was echoed from Sal ve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.",
      "The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",
      "The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop t. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the M le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.",
      "This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, William, dear angel!",
      "this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!",
      "As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",
      "A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy d mon, to whom I had given life.",
      "What did he there?",
      "Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?",
      "No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",
      "The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",
      "Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.",
      "_He_ was the murderer!",
      "I could not doubt it.",
      "The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.",
      "I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal ve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.",
      "He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",
      "I remained motionless.",
      "The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",
      "I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.",
      "Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?",
      "I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",
      "But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.",
      "I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.",
      "The gates were open, and I hastened to my father s house.",
      "My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.",
      "But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.",
      "A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",
      "I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.",
      "I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.",
      "Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.",
      "And then of what use would be pursuit?",
      "Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Sal ve?",
      "These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father s house.",
      "I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.",
      "Beloved and venerable parent!",
      "He still remained to me.",
      "I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.",
      "It was an historical subject, painted at my father s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.",
      "Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.",
      "Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.",
      "While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: Welcome, my dearest Victor, said he.",
      "Ah!",
      "I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.",
      "You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.",
      "he was our darling and our pride!",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.",
      "Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.",
      "I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",
      "She most of all, said Ernest, requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.",
      "But since the murderer has been discovered The murderer discovered!",
      "how can that be?",
      "who could attempt to pursue him?",
      "It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.",
      "I saw him too; he was free last night!",
      "I do not know what you mean, replied my brother, in accents of wonder, but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",
      "No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",
      "Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?",
      "Justine Moritz!",
      "Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?",
      "But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?",
      "No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.",
      "But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.",
      "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days.",
      "During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.",
      "The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.",
      "On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.",
      "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",
      "Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.",
      "At that instant my father entered.",
      "I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, Good God, papa!",
      "Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.",
      "We do also, unfortunately, replied my father, for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.",
      "My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.",
      "If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",
      "She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.",
      "This speech calmed me.",
      "I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",
      "I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.",
      "My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.",
      "Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth.",
      "Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.",
      "There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.",
      "She welcomed me with the greatest affection.",
      "Your arrival, my dear cousin, said she, fills me with hope.",
      "You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.",
      "who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
      "I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.",
      "Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.",
      "If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.",
      "But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.",
      "She is innocent, my Elizabeth, said I, and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.",
      "How kind and generous you are!",
      "every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.",
      "She wept.",
      "Dearest niece, said my father, dry your tears.",
      "If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.",
      "Chapter 8 We passed a few sad hours until eleven o clock, when the trial was to commence.",
      "My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.",
      "During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.",
      "It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",
      "Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!",
      "A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.",
      "The appearance of Justine was calm.",
      "She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.",
      "Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",
      "She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.",
      "When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.",
      "A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.",
      "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.",
      "Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.",
      "She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.",
      "The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.",
      "She returned to the house about eight o clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.",
      "When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.",
      "The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",
      "Justine was called on for her defence.",
      "As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.",
      "Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.",
      "Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.",
      "God knows, she said, how entirely I am innocent.",
      "But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.",
      "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Ch ne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.",
      "On her return, at about nine o clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.",
      "She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",
      "Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.",
      "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.",
      "If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.",
      "That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",
      "Concerning the picture she could give no account.",
      "I know, continued the unhappy victim, how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.",
      "But here also I am checked.",
      "I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.",
      "Did the murderer place it there?",
      "I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?",
      "I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.",
      "I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.",
      "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.",
      "Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.",
      "I am, said she, the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.",
      "It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.",
      "I am well acquainted with the accused.",
      "I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.",
      "During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.",
      "She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",
      "She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.",
      "For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.",
      "She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.",
      "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.",
      "She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",
      "My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.",
      "I believed in her innocence; I knew it.",
      "Could the d mon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?",
      "I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.",
      "The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",
      "I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.",
      "In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.",
      "I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.",
      "The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.",
      "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.",
      "I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.",
      "The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.",
      "That evidence, he observed, was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.",
      "This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?",
      "Had my eyes deceived me?",
      "And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?",
      "I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",
      "My cousin, replied I, it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.",
      "But she has confessed.",
      "This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine s innocence.",
      "said she.",
      "How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?",
      "Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",
      "Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.",
      "Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.",
      "My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.",
      "Yes, said Elizabeth, I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.",
      "The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.",
      "We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.",
      "She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",
      "My cousin wept also.",
      "Oh, Justine!",
      "Why did you rob me of my last consolation?",
      "I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.",
      "And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",
      "Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?",
      "Her voice was suffocated with sobs.",
      "Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth; why do you kneel, if you are innocent?",
      "I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.",
      "That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.",
      "I did confess, but I confessed a lie.",
      "I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.",
      "The God of heaven forgive me!",
      "Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.",
      "He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate.",
      "Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",
      "In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.",
      "She paused, weeping, and then continued, I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",
      "Dear William!",
      "dearest blessed child!",
      "I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.",
      "Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.",
      "Why did you confess?",
      "But do not mourn, dear girl.",
      "Do not fear.",
      "I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.",
      "I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.",
      "You shall not die!",
      "You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!",
      "No!",
      "I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.",
      "Justine shook her head mournfully.",
      "I do not fear to die, she said; that pang is past.",
      "God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.",
      "I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me.",
      "Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!",
      "During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",
      "Despair!",
      "Who dared talk of that?",
      "The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony.",
      "I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.",
      "Justine started.",
      "When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?",
      "I could not answer.",
      "No, Justine, said Elizabeth; he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.",
      "I truly thank him.",
      "In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.",
      "How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!",
      "It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.",
      "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.",
      "She indeed gained the resignation she desired.",
      "But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.",
      "Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",
      "Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.",
      "We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.",
      "I wish, cried she, that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.",
      "Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.",
      "She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!",
      "Live, and be happy, and make others so.",
      "And on the morrow Justine died.",
      "Elizabeth s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.",
      "My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.",
      "And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.",
      "Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",
      "She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!",
      "From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.",
      "This also was my doing!",
      "And my father s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!",
      "Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!",
      "Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",
      "Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",
      "Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",
      "Chapter 9 Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.",
      "Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.",
      "The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.",
      "Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.",
      "Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.",
      "I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.",
      "Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.",
      "This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.",
      "I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",
      "My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.",
      "Do you think, Victor, said he, that I do not suffer also?",
      "No one could love a child more than I loved your brother tears came into his eyes as he spoke but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?",
      "It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.",
      "This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.",
      "Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.",
      "About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.",
      "This change was particularly agreeable to me.",
      "The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me.",
      "I was now free.",
      "Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.",
      "Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",
      "I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.",
      "But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",
      "I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?",
      "At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.",
      "But that could not be.",
      "Remorse extinguished every hope.",
      "I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.",
      "I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.",
      "There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind.",
      "My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.",
      "When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.",
      "When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.",
      "I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base.",
      "I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",
      "Our house was the house of mourning.",
      "My father s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.",
      "Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.",
      "She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.",
      "The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.",
      "When I reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.",
      "Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other s blood.",
      "Yet I am certainly unjust.",
      "Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.",
      "For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!",
      "I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.",
      "But she was innocent.",
      "I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.",
      "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",
      "I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",
      "William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.",
      "But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.",
      "I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.",
      "I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.",
      "Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.",
      "These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.",
      "There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.",
      "Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.",
      "Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.",
      "Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?",
      "While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing what can disturb our peace?",
      "And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?",
      "Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",
      "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.",
      "I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.",
      "The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",
      "Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.",
      "It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.",
      "My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix.",
      "I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.",
      "Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",
      "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.",
      "I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.",
      "The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",
      "The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.",
      "The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise.",
      "Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",
      "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.",
      "But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.",
      "I passed the bridge of P lissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.",
      "Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.",
      "This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.",
      "The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.",
      "Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.",
      "Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its tremendous _d me_ overlooked the valley.",
      "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.",
      "Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.",
      "The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.",
      "Then again the kindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.",
      "Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",
      "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.",
      "Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.",
      "For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.",
      "The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.",
      "Chapter 10 I spent the following day roaming through the valley.",
      "I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.",
      "The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.",
      "These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.",
      "They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it.",
      "In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.",
      "I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.",
      "They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.",
      "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?",
      "All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.",
      "The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.",
      "Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.",
      "What were rain and storm to me?",
      "My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.",
      "I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.",
      "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.",
      "The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.",
      "I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.",
      "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.",
      "It is a scene terrifically desolate.",
      "In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.",
      "The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.",
      "The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.",
      "I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me.",
      "Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.",
      "If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.",
      "We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.",
      "We rise; one wand ring thought pollutes the day.",
      "We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, The path of its departure still is free.",
      "Man s yesterday may ne er be like his morrow; Nought may endure but mutability!",
      "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.",
      "For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.",
      "A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.",
      "Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",
      "The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.",
      "The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",
      "The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.",
      "From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.",
      "I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.",
      "The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.",
      "Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.",
      "My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.",
      "As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.",
      "He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.",
      "I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.",
      "I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)",
      "that it was the wretch whom I had created.",
      "I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.",
      "He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.",
      "But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.",
      "Devil, I exclaimed, do you dare approach me?",
      "And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?",
      "Begone, vile insect!",
      "Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!",
      "And, oh!",
      "That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!",
      "I expected this reception, said the d mon.",
      "All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!",
      "Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.",
      "You purpose to kill me.",
      "How dare you sport thus with life?",
      "Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.",
      "If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.",
      "Abhorred monster!",
      "Fiend that thou art!",
      "The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.",
      "Wretched devil!",
      "You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.",
      "My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",
      "He easily eluded me and said, Be calm!",
      "I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.",
      "Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?",
      "Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.",
      "Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple.",
      "But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.",
      "I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.",
      "Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due.",
      "Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.",
      "Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded.",
      "I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.",
      "Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.",
      "Begone!",
      "I will not hear you.",
      "There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.",
      "Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.",
      "How can I move thee?",
      "Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?",
      "Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?",
      "You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?",
      "They spurn and hate me.",
      "The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.",
      "I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.",
      "These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.",
      "If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.",
      "Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?",
      "I will keep no terms with my enemies.",
      "I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness.",
      "Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.",
      "Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.",
      "Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.",
      "But hear me.",
      "The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.",
      "Listen to me, Frankenstein.",
      "You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.",
      "Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!",
      "Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.",
      "Why do you call to my remembrance, I rejoined, circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?",
      "Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!",
      "Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!",
      "You have made me wretched beyond expression.",
      "You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.",
      "Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.",
      "Thus I relieve thee, my creator, he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.",
      "Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.",
      "By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.",
      "Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain.",
      "The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide.",
      "On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.",
      "As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.",
      "My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.",
      "I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution.",
      "I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.",
      "For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.",
      "These motives urged me to comply with his demand.",
      "We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.",
      "The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.",
      "But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.",
      "Chapter 11 It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.",
      "A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.",
      "By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.",
      "Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again.",
      "I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",
      "Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",
      "The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.",
      "This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",
      "This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.",
      "I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
      "It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",
      "Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.",
      "I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.",
      "Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.",
      "I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.",
      "[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder.",
      "It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.",
      "I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",
      "No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.",
      "I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.",
      "Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.",
      "I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.",
      "I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.",
      "I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",
      "Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.",
      "Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.",
      "The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",
      "My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.",
      "My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.",
      "I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.",
      "One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.",
      "In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",
      "How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",
      "I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.",
      "I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn.",
      "I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.",
      "The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.",
      "I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.",
      "When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",
      "I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.",
      "It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",
      "I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",
      "I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.",
      "When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",
      "I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers.",
      "I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",
      "Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",
      "When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.",
      "In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.",
      "I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.",
      "I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.",
      "A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.",
      "It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",
      "This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity.",
      "Finding the door open, I entered.",
      "An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.",
      "He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.",
      "His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.",
      "But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pand monium appeared to the d mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.",
      "I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.",
      "Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",
      "It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village.",
      "How miraculous did this appear!",
      "The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.",
      "The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",
      "One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.",
      "This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.",
      "My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",
      "No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",
      "Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.",
      "As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.",
      "It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.",
      "One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.",
      "Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.",
      "I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.",
      "The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.",
      "Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.",
      "It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",
      "I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",
      "The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.",
      "Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad.",
      "I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",
      "As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.",
      "Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.",
      "She followed, and they disappeared.",
      "Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.",
      "On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.",
      "In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.",
      "In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",
      "The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.",
      "It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.",
      "The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.",
      "He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.",
      "He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.",
      "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.",
      "The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",
      "She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.",
      "She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.",
      "After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.",
      "The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.",
      "The meal was quickly dispatched.",
      "The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.",
      "One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",
      "The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.",
      "Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",
      "In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.",
      "So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.",
      "The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.",
      "Chapter 12 I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",
      "I thought of the occurrences of the day.",
      "What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.",
      "I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.",
      "The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.",
      "The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.",
      "This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.",
      "The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.",
      "The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.",
      "Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.",
      "They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
      "They were not entirely happy.",
      "The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.",
      "I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.",
      "If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.",
      "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
      "They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.",
      "What did their tears imply?",
      "Did they really express pain?",
      "I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.",
      "A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.",
      "Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.",
      "They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.",
      "This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.",
      "I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",
      "I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.",
      "I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
      "I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.",
      "She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",
      "I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.",
      "By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.",
      "I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.",
      "I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.",
      "This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",
      "But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.",
      "Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.",
      "By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.",
      "The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_.",
      "I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.",
      "I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._ I spent the winter in this manner.",
      "The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.",
      "I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.",
      "The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.",
      "He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.",
      "Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.",
      "It was not thus with Felix.",
      "He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.",
      "But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.",
      "I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",
      "In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",
      "Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.",
      "In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.",
      "At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.",
      "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.",
      "I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?",
      "I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",
      "I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!",
      "At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",
      "I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.",
      "As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",
      "From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.",
      "Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",
      "Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.",
      "The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.",
      "This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
      "My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.",
      "During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.",
      "When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.",
      "When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.",
      "I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.",
      "My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.",
      "I thought (foolish wretch!)",
      "that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.",
      "When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.",
      "I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.",
      "I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.",
      "I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.",
      "These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.",
      "My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",
      "It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.",
      "The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.",
      "Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.",
      "The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.",
      "Happy, happy earth!",
      "Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.",
      "My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.",
      "Chapter 13 I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.",
      "I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.",
      "Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.",
      "It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.",
      "My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.",
      "It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son s sorrow.",
      "Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",
      "It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.",
      "The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.",
      "Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",
      "Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.",
      "On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",
      "Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.",
      "Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.",
      "She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",
      "She did not appear to understand him, but smiled.",
      "He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.",
      "Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",
      "I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.",
      "They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.",
      "Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.",
      "Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.",
      "Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.",
      "Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.",
      "The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.",
      "As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",
      "When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, Good night sweet Safie.",
      "He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.",
      "I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.",
      "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.",
      "She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.",
      "When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.",
      "She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",
      "The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",
      "The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",
      "Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.",
      "In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",
      "My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.",
      "While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.",
      "The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney s _Ruins of Empires_.",
      "I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",
      "He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.",
      "Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.",
      "I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans of their subsequent degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.",
      "I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.",
      "These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.",
      "Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?",
      "He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.",
      "To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.",
      "For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.",
      "Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.",
      "While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.",
      "I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",
      "The words induced me to turn towards myself.",
      "I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.",
      "A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!",
      "And what was I?",
      "Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.",
      "I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.",
      "I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.",
      "When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.",
      "Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
      "I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.",
      "Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",
      "Of what a strange nature is knowledge!",
      "It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.",
      "I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state which I feared yet did not understand.",
      "I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.",
      "The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.",
      "The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.",
      "Miserable, unhappy wretch!",
      "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.",
      "I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",
      "But where were my friends and relations?",
      "No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.",
      "From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.",
      "I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.",
      "What was I?",
      "The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.",
      "I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).",
      "Chapter 14 Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.",
      "It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.",
      "The name of the old man was De Lacey.",
      "He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.",
      "His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.",
      "A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",
      "The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.",
      "He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.",
      "He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.",
      "He was tried and condemned to death.",
      "The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.",
      "Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.",
      "He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.",
      "After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.",
      "Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.",
      "The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.",
      "Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",
      "The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.",
      "Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.",
      "During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French.",
      "She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
      "I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.",
      "Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.",
      "Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.",
      "The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.",
      "She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.",
      "This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.",
      "The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.",
      "The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.",
      "Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.",
      "He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.",
      "Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",
      "Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.",
      "They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
      "The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.",
      "He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.",
      "He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.",
      "His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
      "The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.",
      "The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.",
      "The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.",
      "His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.",
      "This idea was torture to him.",
      "He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",
      "He did not succeed.",
      "They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",
      "They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.",
      "Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",
      "Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",
      "He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.",
      "The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.",
      "When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.",
      "The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.",
      "A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",
      "He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",
      "When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.",
      "A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.",
      "By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.",
      "She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.",
      "Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.",
      "She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",
      "She fell, however, into good hands.",
      "The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.",
      "Chapter 15 Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.",
      "It impressed me deeply.",
      "I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",
      "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.",
      "But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",
      "One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books.",
      "I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.",
      "Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarch s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_.",
      "The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.",
      "I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.",
      "They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",
      "In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",
      "The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom.",
      "But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.",
      "The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.",
      "I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.",
      "As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.",
      "I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.",
      "I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.",
      "The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation.",
      "My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.",
      "What did this mean?",
      "Who was I?",
      "Whence did I come?",
      "What was my destination?",
      "These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.",
      "The volume of _Plutarch s Lives_ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.",
      "This book had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.",
      "I learned from Werter s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",
      "Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.",
      "I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.",
      "But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men.",
      "The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action.",
      "I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.",
      "I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.",
      "Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.",
      "The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.",
      "But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.",
      "I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history.",
      "It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.",
      "I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own.",
      "Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect.",
      "He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",
      "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.",
      "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.",
      "Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.",
      "At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",
      "It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.",
      "You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.",
      "You doubtless recollect these papers.",
      "Here they are.",
      "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible.",
      "I sickened as I read.",
      "Hateful day when I received life!",
      "I exclaimed in agony.",
      "Accursed creator!",
      "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust?",
      "God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.",
      "Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.",
      "These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.",
      "Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?",
      "I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.",
      "I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",
      "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",
      "Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.",
      "The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",
      "Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.",
      "They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous.",
      "Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.",
      "I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.",
      "I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.",
      "But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.",
      "I remembered Adam s supplication to his Creator.",
      "But where was mine?",
      "He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",
      "Autumn passed thus.",
      "I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",
      "Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.",
      "But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers.",
      "Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.",
      "They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.",
      "The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.",
      "I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.",
      "The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.",
      "I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.",
      "The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.",
      "My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.",
      "I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",
      "I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.",
      "My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.",
      "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.",
      "When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",
      "At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
      "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears.",
      "The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.",
      "All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.",
      "Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",
      "The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.",
      "I knocked.",
      "Who is there?",
      "said the old man.",
      "Come in.",
      "I entered.",
      "Pardon this intrusion, said I; I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.",
      "Enter, said De Lacey, and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.",
      "Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.",
      "I sat down, and a silence ensued.",
      "I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.",
      "By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?",
      "No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.",
      "I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.",
      "Are they Germans?",
      "No, they are French.",
      "But let us change the subject.",
      "I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.",
      "These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me.",
      "I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.",
      "Do not despair.",
      "To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.",
      "Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.",
      "They are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.",
      "I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.",
      "That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?",
      "I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors.",
      "I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.",
      "Where do these friends reside?",
      "Near this spot.",
      "The old man paused and then continued, If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them.",
      "I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.",
      "I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.",
      "Excellent man!",
      "I thank you and accept your generous offer.",
      "You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.",
      "Heaven forbid!",
      "Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.",
      "I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.",
      "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
      "From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.",
      "May I know the names and residence of those friends?",
      "I paused.",
      "This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.",
      "I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.",
      "At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.",
      "I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, Now is the time!",
      "Save and protect me!",
      "You and your family are the friends whom I seek.",
      "Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!",
      "exclaimed the old man.",
      "Who are you?",
      "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered.",
      "Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?",
      "Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage.",
      "Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick.",
      "I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.",
      "But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.",
      "I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.",
      "Chapter 16 Cursed, cursed creator!",
      "Why did I live?",
      "Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",
      "I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.",
      "I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.",
      "When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings.",
      "I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.",
      "What a miserable night I passed!",
      "The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.",
      "All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.",
      "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.",
      "There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?",
      "No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
      "The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.",
      "Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.",
      "The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.",
      "I had certainly acted imprudently.",
      "It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.",
      "I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach.",
      "But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.",
      "These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.",
      "The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father s feet.",
      "I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.",
      "When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage.",
      "All there was at peace.",
      "I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose.",
      "That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.",
      "I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.",
      "The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.",
      "Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors.",
      "Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
      "Do you consider, said his companion to him, that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden?",
      "I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.",
      "It is utterly useless, replied Felix; we can never again inhabit your cottage.",
      "The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.",
      "My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.",
      "I entreat you not to reason with me any more.",
      "Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.",
      "Felix trembled violently as he said this.",
      "He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.",
      "I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.",
      "I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair.",
      "My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world.",
      "For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.",
      "When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.",
      "But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.",
      "As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.",
      "As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.",
      "I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched.",
      "A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected.",
      "The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
      "As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",
      "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
      "I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.",
      "At length the thought of you crossed my mind.",
      "I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?",
      "Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.",
      "You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.",
      "But how was I to direct myself?",
      "I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide.",
      "I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair.",
      "From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.",
      "Unfeeling, heartless creator!",
      "You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.",
      "But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.",
      "My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.",
      "It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.",
      "I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.",
      "Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.",
      "Oh, earth!",
      "How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!",
      "The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.",
      "The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",
      "Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.",
      "A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path.",
      "The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",
      "I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man.",
      "One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air.",
      "I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.",
      "Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.",
      "Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",
      "I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.",
      "Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.",
      "I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport.",
      "She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream.",
      "I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.",
      "She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.",
      "On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.",
      "I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.",
      "I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",
      "This was then the reward of my benevolence!",
      "I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.",
      "The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.",
      "Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.",
      "But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",
      "For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.",
      "The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it.",
      "My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.",
      "My daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.",
      "After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.",
      "The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.",
      "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.",
      "It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.",
      "I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.",
      "At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy.",
      "Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.",
      "If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.",
      "Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.",
      "As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, Child, what is the meaning of this?",
      "I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.",
      "He struggled violently.",
      "Let me go, he cried; monster!",
      "Ugly wretch!",
      "You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.",
      "You are an ogre.",
      "Let me go, or I will tell my papa.",
      "Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.",
      "Hideous monster!",
      "Let me go.",
      "My papa is a syndic he is M. Frankenstein he will punish you.",
      "You dare not keep me.",
      "Frankenstein!",
      "you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.",
      "The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.",
      "I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.",
      "As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.",
      "I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.",
      "In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.",
      "For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.",
      "Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?",
      "I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.",
      "While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.",
      "A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.",
      "Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.",
      "And then I bent over her and whispered, Awake, fairest, thy lover is near he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!",
      "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.",
      "Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",
      "Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.",
      "The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.",
      "The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!",
      "Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.",
      "I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.",
      "She moved again, and I fled.",
      "For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever.",
      "At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify.",
      "We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.",
      "I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.",
      "My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.",
      "This being you must create.",
      "Chapter 17 The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply.",
      "But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.",
      "He continued, You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.",
      "This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.",
      "The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.",
      "I do refuse it, I replied; and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.",
      "You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.",
      "Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.",
      "I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.",
      "You are in the wrong, replied the fiend; and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you.",
      "I am malicious because I am miserable.",
      "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
      "You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?",
      "You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.",
      "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
      "Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.",
      "But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.",
      "Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.",
      "I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.",
      "Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.",
      "A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded I intended to reason.",
      "This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess.",
      "If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature s sake I would make peace with the whole kind!",
      "But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.",
      "What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.",
      "It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.",
      "Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.",
      "My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!",
      "Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!",
      "I was moved.",
      "I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.",
      "His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",
      "He saw my change of feeling and continued, If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.",
      "My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.",
      "My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.",
      "We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.",
      "The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.",
      "Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.",
      "You propose, replied I, to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.",
      "How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?",
      "You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.",
      "This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.",
      "How inconstant are your feelings!",
      "But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",
      "I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.",
      "My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!",
      "My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.",
      "His words had a strange effect upon me.",
      "I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.",
      "I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.",
      "You swear, I said, to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?",
      "May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?",
      "How is this?",
      "I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.",
      "If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.",
      "My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.",
      "I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.",
      "I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.",
      "I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.",
      "His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.",
      "After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.",
      "Turning to him, therefore, I said, I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.",
      "I swear, he cried, by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.",
      "Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.",
      "Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.",
      "I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.",
      "His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed.",
      "I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.",
      "The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.",
      "Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.",
      "The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me.",
      "I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, Oh!",
      "stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.",
      "These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.",
      "Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.",
      "Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations they weighed on me with a mountain s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.",
      "Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family.",
      "My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.",
      "I felt as if I were placed under a ban as if I had no right to claim their sympathies as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.",
      "Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task.",
      "The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.",
      "Chapter 18 Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.",
      "I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.",
      "I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.",
      "I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me.",
      "A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.",
      "My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.",
      "At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.",
      "I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.",
      "But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.",
      "It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.",
      "And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.",
      "For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.",
      "Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.",
      "I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.",
      "You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another.",
      "But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.",
      "You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.",
      "Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.",
      "My dear father, reassure yourself.",
      "I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.",
      "I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection.",
      "My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.",
      "The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.",
      "If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.",
      "But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.",
      "Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage.",
      "We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",
      "You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.",
      "Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.",
      "Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.",
      "I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.",
      "I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.",
      "To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.",
      "I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!",
      "Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground?",
      "I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.",
      "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.",
      "The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved.",
      "I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.",
      "I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation.",
      "I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.",
      "Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness.",
      "My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever.",
      "Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever.",
      "These feelings dictated my answer to my father.",
      "I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply.",
      "After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.",
      "The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.",
      "One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.",
      "Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.",
      "This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection.",
      "Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe.",
      "If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",
      "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.",
      "My father s age rendered him extremely averse to delay.",
      "For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.",
      "I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.",
      "During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.",
      "But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England?",
      "This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",
      "I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.",
      "But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.",
      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.",
      "My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.",
      "It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman s sedulous attention.",
      "She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.",
      "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",
      "I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me.",
      "Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.",
      "I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.",
      "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval.",
      "He came.",
      "Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",
      "He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day.",
      "He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.",
      "This is what it is to live, he cried; now I enjoy existence!",
      "But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!",
      "In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.",
      "And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.",
      "I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.",
      "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",
      "During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.",
      "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz.",
      "The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.",
      "The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",
      "We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.",
      "This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape.",
      "In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.",
      "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.",
      "Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",
      "I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.",
      "And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?",
      "He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.",
      "I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",
      "The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.",
      "Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain.",
      "Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.",
      "Clerval!",
      "Beloved friend!",
      "Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.",
      "He was a being formed in the very poetry of nature.",
      "His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.",
      "His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.",
      "But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.",
      "The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to him An appetite; a feeling, and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrow d from the eye.",
      "[Wordsworth s Tintern Abbey .]",
      "And where does he now exist?",
      "Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever?",
      "Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?",
      "Does it now only exist in my memory?",
      "No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.",
      "Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",
      "I will proceed with my tale.",
      "Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.",
      "Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.",
      "It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain.",
      "The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.",
      "We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich places which I had heard of even in my country.",
      "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.",
      "Chapter 19 London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city.",
      "Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.",
      "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",
      "But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.",
      "Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.",
      "But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.",
      "I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.",
      "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.",
      "The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.",
      "He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.",
      "His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade.",
      "In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.",
      "He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",
      "I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.",
      "I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",
      "I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.",
      "Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",
      "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",
      "He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.",
      "Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",
      "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.",
      "We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.",
      "In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.",
      "I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",
      "We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",
      "This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.",
      "From thence we proceeded to Oxford.",
      "As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.",
      "It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.",
      "This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.",
      "The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.",
      "The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",
      "If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",
      "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.",
      "I was formed for peaceful happiness.",
      "During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits.",
      "But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",
      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.",
      "Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.",
      "We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.",
      "For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.",
      "For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.",
      "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.",
      "The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.",
      "We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",
      "The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.",
      "I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.",
      "The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.",
      "Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.",
      "The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.",
      "I could pass my life here, said he to me; and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.",
      "But he found that a traveller s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.",
      "His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.",
      "For my own part I was not sorry.",
      "I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d mon s disappointment.",
      "He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.",
      "This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.",
      "I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.",
      "Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.",
      "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.",
      "I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.",
      "I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.",
      "Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.",
      "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur s Seat, St. Bernard s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",
      "But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.",
      "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",
      "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.",
      "Do you, said I, enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.",
      "I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.",
      "He entreated me to write often.",
      "I had rather be with you, he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.",
      "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.",
      "I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.",
      "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.",
      "It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.",
      "The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.",
      "Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.",
      "This I hired.",
      "It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.",
      "The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.",
      "I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.",
      "As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.",
      "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.",
      "It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.",
      "I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.",
      "Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.",
      "Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
      "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.",
      "Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.",
      "It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.",
      "During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.",
      "But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",
      "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.",
      "Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.",
      "Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.",
      "I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.",
      "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.",
      "I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.",
      "Chapter 20 I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it.",
      "As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.",
      "Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse.",
      "I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.",
      "He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.",
      "They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?",
      "She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.",
      "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror.",
      "Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
      "I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",
      "I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the d mon at the casement.",
      "A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.",
      "Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.",
      "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.",
      "I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.",
      "The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",
      "I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.",
      "I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.",
      "Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.",
      "A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.",
      "I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.",
      "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.",
      "I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.",
      "Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",
      "Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?",
      "Do you dare to break your promise?",
      "I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.",
      "I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.",
      "I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?",
      "I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.",
      "Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension.",
      "Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.",
      "You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!",
      "The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.",
      "Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.",
      "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d mon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?",
      "I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage.",
      "The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.",
      "Shall each man, cried he, find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?",
      "I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.",
      "Man!",
      "You may hate, but beware!",
      "Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever.",
      "Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?",
      "You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!",
      "I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.",
      "Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.",
      "I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.",
      "Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.",
      "Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.",
      "I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.",
      "Leave me; I am inexorable.",
      "It is well.",
      "I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night.",
      "I started forward and exclaimed, Villain!",
      "Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.",
      "I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation.",
      "In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.",
      "All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.",
      "I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.",
      "I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",
      "Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?",
      "But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.",
      "I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.",
      "And then I thought again of his words _I will be with you on your wedding-night._ That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.",
      "In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.",
      "The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.",
      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair.",
      "I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.",
      "I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.",
      "If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a d mon whom I had myself created.",
      "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.",
      "When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep.",
      "I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",
      "The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.",
      "He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.",
      "He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.",
      "He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.",
      "This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.",
      "The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.",
      "The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.",
      "I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.",
      "With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d mon.",
      "I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.",
      "The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",
      "I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.",
      "I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.",
      "At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.",
      "The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.",
      "But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",
      "Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.",
      "The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",
      "I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.",
      "I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.",
      "Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.",
      "I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.",
      "I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.",
      "I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.",
      "I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.",
      "I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.",
      "Fiend, I exclaimed, your task is already fulfilled!",
      "I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.",
      "This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.",
      "But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!",
      "I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.",
      "It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.",
      "I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.",
      "I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.",
      "As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.",
      "Fortunately I had money with me.",
      "As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.",
      "They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.",
      "As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.",
      "My good friends, said I, will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?",
      "You will know that soon enough, replied a man with a hoarse voice.",
      "Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.",
      "Why do you answer me so roughly?",
      "I replied.",
      "Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.",
      "I do not know, said the man, what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.",
      "Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.",
      "I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.",
      "I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin s to give an account of yourself.",
      "Who is Mr. Kirwin?",
      "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
      "Is not this a free country?",
      "Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.",
      "Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.",
      "I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.",
      "I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.",
      "Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.",
      "Chapter 21 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.",
      "He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.",
      "It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.",
      "He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.",
      "As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.",
      "His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.",
      "Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.",
      "They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.",
      "It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.",
      "He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.",
      "The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.",
      "The son confirmed his father s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.",
      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.",
      "They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.",
      "This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.",
      "I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.",
      "I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.",
      "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
      "I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.",
      "The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.",
      "I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?",
      "Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",
      "A fever succeeded to this.",
      "I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",
      "Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",
      "Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",
      "Why did I not die?",
      "More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?",
      "Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",
      "Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.",
      "She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class.",
      "The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.",
      "Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",
      "Are you better now, sir?",
      "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.",
      "For that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!",
      "However, that s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",
      "The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",
      "The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.",
      "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness.",
      "He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.",
      "It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.",
      "He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.",
      "I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.",
      "At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.",
      "Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?",
      "I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.",
      "I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.",
      "But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.",
      "That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals.",
      "Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?",
      "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred.",
      "You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder.",
      "The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",
      "I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.",
      "I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.",
      "I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.",
      "This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?",
      "Your family is perfectly well, said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.",
      "I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, Oh!",
      "Take him away!",
      "I cannot see him; for God s sake, do not let him enter!",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.",
      "He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.",
      "My father!",
      "cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.",
      "Is my father indeed come?",
      "How kind, how very kind!",
      "But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?",
      "My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",
      "He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",
      "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father.",
      "I stretched out my hand to him and cried, Are you then safe and Elizabeth and Ernest?",
      "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.",
      "What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.",
      "You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.",
      "And poor Clerval The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.",
      "Yes, my father, replied I; some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.",
      "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.",
      "Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.",
      "But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.",
      "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate.",
      "The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.",
      "More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.",
      "Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?",
      "It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close.",
      "Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.",
      "Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",
      "The season of the assizes approached.",
      "I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held.",
      "Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.",
      "I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.",
      "The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.",
      "I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.",
      "The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",
      "Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.",
      "He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair.",
      "At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair.",
      "It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous.",
      "My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck the shadow of a human being.",
      "My strength was gone.",
      "I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.",
      "We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.",
      "It was midnight.",
      "I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.",
      "I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.",
      "The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",
      "I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.",
      "I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.",
      "I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.",
      "Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",
      "But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.",
      "Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.",
      "My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.",
      "Chapter 22 The voyage came to an end.",
      "We landed, and proceeded to Paris.",
      "I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey.",
      "My father s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",
      "He wished me to seek amusement in society.",
      "I abhorred the face of man.",
      "Oh, not abhorred!",
      "They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.",
      "But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse.",
      "I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.",
      "How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",
      "My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.",
      "Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",
      "My father, said I, how little do you know me.",
      "Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.",
      "Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this I murdered her.",
      "William, Justine, and Henry they all died by my hands.",
      "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.",
      "I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.",
      "I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",
      "But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.",
      "I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",
      "Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.",
      "I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",
      "Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?",
      "My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.",
      "I am not mad, I cried energetically; the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",
      "I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.",
      "A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.",
      "The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",
      "He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.",
      "As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",
      "By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.",
      "A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth: My dear Friend, It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight.",
      "My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!",
      "I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.",
      "This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.",
      "Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",
      "I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.",
      "Explanation!",
      "You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?",
      "If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.",
      "But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",
      "You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy.",
      "We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.",
      "We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",
      "But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case?",
      "Tell me, dearest Victor.",
      "Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth Do you not love another?",
      "You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",
      "But this is false reasoning.",
      "I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.",
      "But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.",
      "Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.",
      "I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.",
      "Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.",
      "Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",
      "Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",
      "My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.",
      "Geneva, May 18th, 17 This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend _I will be with you on your wedding-night!_ Such was my sentence, and on that night would the d mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.",
      "On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.",
      "Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.",
      "If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.",
      "What freedom?",
      "Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.",
      "Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",
      "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!",
      "I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",
      "Yet I would die to make her happy.",
      "If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",
      "My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",
      "He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats.",
      "I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father s happiness, my adversary s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.",
      "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.",
      "My letter was calm and affectionate.",
      "I fear, my beloved girl, I said, little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.",
      "Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment.",
      "I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.",
      "I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",
      "But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",
      "This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.",
      "In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth s letter we returned to Geneva.",
      "The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",
      "I saw a change in her also.",
      "She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.",
      "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.",
      "Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent.",
      "I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",
      "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.",
      "She wept with me and for me.",
      "When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation.",
      "It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.",
      "The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.",
      "Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.",
      "I remained silent.",
      "Have you, then, some other attachment?",
      "None on earth.",
      "I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.",
      "Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.",
      "My dear Victor, do not speak thus.",
      "Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.",
      "Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.",
      "And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.",
      "Such were the lessons of my father.",
      "But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words _I shall be with you on your wedding-night_, I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable.",
      "But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.",
      "If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.",
      "But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.",
      "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",
      "But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.",
      "She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",
      "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance.",
      "I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.",
      "Through my father s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.",
      "A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.",
      "It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.",
      "I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",
      "Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
      "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.",
      "But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.",
      "My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",
      "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.",
      "The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.",
      "We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Sal ve, the pleasant banks of Montal gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",
      "I took the hand of Elizabeth.",
      "You are sorrowful, my love.",
      "If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.",
      "Be happy, my dear Victor, replied Elizabeth; there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.",
      "Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.",
      "Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.",
      "Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.",
      "What a divine day!",
      "How happy and serene all nature appears!",
      "Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.",
      "But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.",
      "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.",
      "The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",
      "The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
      "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.",
      "The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.",
      "Chapter 23 It was eight o clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",
      "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west.",
      "The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise.",
      "Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.",
      "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",
      "I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.",
      "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?",
      "What is it you fear?",
      "Peace, peace, my love, replied I; this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.",
      "I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",
      "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.",
      "But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream.",
      "It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.",
      "As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",
      "This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.",
      "Why did I not then expire!",
      "Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?",
      "She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",
      "Everywhere I turn I see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.",
      "Could I behold this and live?",
      "Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.",
      "For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.",
      "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.",
      "I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",
      "She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.",
      "I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",
      "The murderous mark of the fiend s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.",
      "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.",
      "The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.",
      "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.",
      "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.",
      "I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.",
      "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.",
      "I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.",
      "After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy.",
      "After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.",
      "In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay.",
      "There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause.",
      "I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.",
      "The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.",
      "This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.",
      "I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",
      "However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",
      "I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.",
      "But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.",
      "I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.",
      "If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",
      "Tears streamed from my eyes.",
      "The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.",
      "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.",
      "The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.",
      "A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?",
      "Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",
      "Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",
      "My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.",
      "I arrived at Geneva.",
      "My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.",
      "I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!",
      "His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",
      "Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!",
      "He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",
      "What then became of me?",
      "I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon.",
      "Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.",
      "For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",
      "As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause the monster whom I had created, the miserable d mon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction.",
      "I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.",
      "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.",
      "Be assured, sir, said he, no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.",
      "I thank you, replied I; listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.",
      "It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.",
      "The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.",
      "My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.",
      "I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.",
      "When I had concluded my narration, I said, This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.",
      "It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.",
      "This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.",
      "He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.",
      "He, however, answered mildly, I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.",
      "Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?",
      "Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.",
      "I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey.",
      "But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.",
      "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.",
      "You are mistaken, said he.",
      "I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.",
      "But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.",
      "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.",
      "My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",
      "My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.",
      "You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.",
      "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",
      "But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness.",
      "He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.",
      "Man, I cried, how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!",
      "Cease; you know not what it is you say.",
      "I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.",
      "Chapter 24 My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.",
      "I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.",
      "My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful.",
      "I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",
      "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.",
      "I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.",
      "How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.",
      "But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.",
      "When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.",
      "But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.",
      "As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed.",
      "I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.",
      "Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.",
      "The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.",
      "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair.",
      "They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",
      "I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d mon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",
      "For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever.",
      "And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.",
      "Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.",
      "I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",
      "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.",
      "It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",
      "Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.",
      "The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, I am satisfied, miserable wretch!",
      "You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.",
      "I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp.",
      "Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.",
      "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.",
      "Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",
      "The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",
      "I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.",
      "Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.",
      "The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain.",
      "To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?",
      "Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",
      "Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.",
      "The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.",
      "Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d mon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected.",
      "In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path.",
      "I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy.",
      "O blessed sleep!",
      "Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",
      "The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",
      "Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",
      "During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",
      "Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.",
      "What agonising fondness did I feel for them!",
      "How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!",
      "At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the d mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.",
      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury.",
      "My reign is not yet over these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live, and my power is complete.",
      "Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive.",
      "You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.",
      "Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.",
      "Scoffing devil!",
      "Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death.",
      "Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",
      "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",
      "The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.",
      "The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",
      "The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.",
      "One inscription that he left was in these words: Prepare!",
      "Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.",
      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon.",
      "How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!",
      "Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.",
      "The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.",
      "I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.",
      "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.",
      "I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",
      "With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore.",
      "I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.",
      "A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance.",
      "He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",
      "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.",
      "He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",
      "Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",
      "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.",
      "I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.",
      "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.",
      "Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",
      "But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.",
      "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.",
      "Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.",
      "Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",
      "I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.",
      "With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!",
      "Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the d mon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.",
      "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route.",
      "The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",
      "I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.",
      "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.",
      "A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific.",
      "I pressed on, but in vain.",
      "The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.",
      "The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.",
      "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.",
      "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight.",
      "I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship.",
      "I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.",
      "I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.",
      "But your direction was northwards.",
      "You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",
      "When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d mon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?",
      "If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death.",
      "And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?",
      "No; I am not so selfish.",
      "Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.",
      "He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.",
      "His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice.",
      "Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart.",
      "I will hover near and direct the steel aright.",
      "Walton, _in continuation._ August 26th, 17 .",
      "You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?",
      "Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish.",
      "His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.",
      "Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",
      "His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected.",
      "Such a monster has, then, really existence!",
      "I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.",
      "Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",
      "Are you mad, my friend?",
      "said he.",
      "Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?",
      "Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?",
      "Peace, peace!",
      "Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.",
      "Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.",
      "Since you have preserved my narration, said he, I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.",
      "Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed.",
      "My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.",
      "I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.",
      "Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.",
      "This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.",
      "Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.",
      "On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.",
      "His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears.",
      "What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!",
      "He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.",
      "When younger, said he, I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.",
      "My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.",
      "This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.",
      "When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.",
      "But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust.",
      "All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.",
      "My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man.",
      "Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.",
      "I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects.",
      "From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!",
      "My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.",
      "Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.",
      "Must I then lose this admirable being?",
      "I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me.",
      "Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him.",
      "I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",
      "I thank you, Walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?",
      "Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?",
      "Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.",
      "They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.",
      "A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion.",
      "But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear.",
      "They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.",
      "If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.",
      "But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.",
      "My beloved Sister, September 2d.",
      "I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it.",
      "I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.",
      "The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow.",
      "There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.",
      "Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me.",
      "If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.",
      "And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?",
      "You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.",
      "Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope.",
      "My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.",
      "But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.",
      "Heaven bless you and make you so!",
      "My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.",
      "He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued.",
      "He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.",
      "Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man.",
      "These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.",
      "September 5th.",
      "A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.",
      "We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict.",
      "The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.",
      "Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.",
      "I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.",
      "This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.",
      "They entered, and their leader addressed me.",
      "He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.",
      "We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.",
      "They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.",
      "This speech troubled me.",
      "I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free.",
      "Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",
      "I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.",
      "Turning towards the men, he said, What do you mean?",
      "What do you demand of your captain?",
      "Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",
      "Did you not call this a glorious expedition?",
      "And wherefore was it glorious?",
      "Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.",
      "For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.",
      "You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.",
      "And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.",
      "Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards.",
      "Be men, or be more than men.",
      "Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.",
      "This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.",
      "Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.",
      "Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.",
      "He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?",
      "They looked at one another and were unable to reply.",
      "I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.",
      "They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.",
      "How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.",
      "Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.",
      "September 7th.",
      "The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.",
      "Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.",
      "It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.",
      "September 12th.",
      "It is past; I am returning to England.",
      "I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend.",
      "But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.",
      "September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.",
      "We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.",
      "The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free.",
      "When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.",
      "Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.",
      "They shout, I said, because they will soon return to England.",
      "Do you, then, really return?",
      "Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.",
      "I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.",
      "Do so, if you will; but I will not.",
      "You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.",
      "I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.",
      "Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",
      "It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.",
      "At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak.",
      "The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.",
      "In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.",
      "His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.",
      "I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, Alas!",
      "The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.",
      "Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.",
      "During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.",
      "In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.",
      "This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.",
      "My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.",
      "Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature.",
      "He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.",
      "Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die.",
      "The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.",
      "When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.",
      "Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him.",
      "But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.",
      "I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.",
      "That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.",
      "The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.",
      "Farewell, Walton!",
      "Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.",
      "Yet why do I say this?",
      "I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.",
      "His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.",
      "About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.",
      "Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?",
      "What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?",
      "All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.",
      "My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.",
      "But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.",
      "I am interrupted.",
      "What do these sounds portend?",
      "It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.",
      "Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.",
      "I must arise and examine.",
      "Good night, my sister.",
      "what a scene has just taken place!",
      "I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.",
      "I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.",
      "I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.",
      "Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.",
      "As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.",
      "When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window.",
      "Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness.",
      "I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.",
      "I called on him to stay.",
      "He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.",
      "That is also my victim!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!",
      "Oh, Frankenstein!",
      "Generous and self-devoted being!",
      "What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?",
      "I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.",
      "He is cold, he cannot answer me.",
      "His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",
      "I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.",
      "I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.",
      "The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.",
      "At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.",
      "Your repentance, I said, is now superfluous.",
      "If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.",
      "And do you dream?",
      "said the d mon.",
      "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?",
      "He, he continued, pointing to the corpse, he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.",
      "Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.",
      "A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.",
      "Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears?",
      "My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.",
      "After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome.",
      "I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.",
      "But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.",
      "I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.",
      "I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey.",
      "Yet when she died!",
      "Nay, then I was not miserable.",
      "I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair.",
      "Evil thenceforth became my good.",
      "Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen.",
      "The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.",
      "And now it is ended; there is my last victim!",
      "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.",
      "Wretch!",
      "I said.",
      "It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.",
      "You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.",
      "Hypocritical fiend!",
      "If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.",
      "It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.",
      "Oh, it is not thus not thus, interrupted the being.",
      "Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions.",
      "Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.",
      "No sympathy may I ever find.",
      "When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.",
      "But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
      "I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",
      "Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.",
      "Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.",
      "I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.",
      "But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.",
      "No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",
      "When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",
      "But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.",
      "Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.",
      "You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.",
      "But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.",
      "For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.",
      "They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",
      "Was there no injustice in this?",
      "Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?",
      "Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?",
      "Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?",
      "Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!",
      "I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",
      "Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.",
      "But it is true that I am a wretch.",
      "I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.",
      "I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.",
      "There he lies, white and cold in death.",
      "You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",
      "I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",
      "Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.",
      "My work is nearly complete.",
      "Neither yours nor any man s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.",
      "Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.",
      "I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been.",
      "I shall die.",
      "I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.",
      "He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.",
      "I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.",
      "Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.",
      "Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.",
      "Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?",
      "Farewell!",
      "I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold.",
      "Farewell, Frankenstein!",
      "If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.",
      "But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel.",
      "Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.",
      "But soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.",
      "Soon these burning miseries will be extinct.",
      "I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.",
      "The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.",
      "My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.",
      "Farewell.",
      "He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.",
      "He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance."
