CHAPTER I.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice without pictures or conversations?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Oh dear!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
I shall be late!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE , but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Well!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How brave they ll all think me at home!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, I wouldn t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
(Which was very likely true.),0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Down, down, down.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
Would the fall _never_ come to an end?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I wonder how many miles I ve fallen by this time?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
she said aloud.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) yes, that s about the right distance but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Presently she began again.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
I wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Antipathies, I think (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all the right word) but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Please, Ma am, is this New Zealand or Australia?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy _curtseying_ as you re falling through the air!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
Do you think you could manage it?),0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
And what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"No, it ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Dinah ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
(Dinah was the cat.),0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Dinah my dear!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I wish you were down here with me!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"There are no mice in the air, I m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s very like a mouse, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Do cats eat bats?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"and sometimes, Do bats eat cats?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"for, you see, as she couldn t answer either question, it didn t much matter which way she put it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"when suddenly, thump!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
thump!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it s getting!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; and even if my head would go through, thought poor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ( which certainly was not here before, said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large letters.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"No, I ll look first, she said, and see whether it s marked _poison_ or not ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, this bottle was _not_ marked poison, so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * What a curious feeling!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said Alice; I must be shutting up like a telescope.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; for it might end, you know, said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I wonder what I should be like then?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come, there s no use in crying like that!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,0
"said Alice to herself, rather sharply; I advise you to leave off this minute!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But it s no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two people!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, there s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, I ll eat it, said Alice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I ll get into the garden, and I don t care which happens!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
Which way?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

The Pool of Tears Curiouser and curiouser!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); now I m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Good-bye, feet!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I m sure _I_ shan t be able!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; but I must be kind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they won t walk the way I want to go!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Let me see: I ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"They must go by the carrier, she thought; and how funny it ll seem, sending presents to one s own feet!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And how odd the directions will look!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"_Alice s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with Alice s love_).",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh dear, what nonsense I m talking!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Poor Alice!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,1,1,0
"It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this), to go on crying in this way!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Stop this moment, I tell you!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"the Duchess, the Duchess!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
Oh!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
won t she be savage if I ve kept her waiting!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please, sir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: Dear, dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How queer everything is to-day!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
And yesterday things went on just as usual.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I wonder if I ve been changed in the night?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But if I m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Ah, _that s_ the great puzzle!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I m sure I m not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all; and I m sure I can t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
she knows such a very little!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Besides, _she s_ she, and _I m_ I, and oh dear, how puzzling it all is!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I ll try if I know all the things I used to know.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is oh dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, the Multiplication Table doesn t signify: let s try Geography.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome no, _that s_ all wrong, I m certain!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I must have been changed for Mabel!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ll try and say _How doth the little_ and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do: How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"I m sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
ever so many lessons to learn!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"No, I ve made up my mind about it; if I m Mabel, I ll stay down here!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I shall only look up and say Who am I then?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,0
"Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I ll come up: if not, I ll stay down here till I m somebody else but, oh dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How _can_ I have done that?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
she thought.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
I must be growing small again.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
That _was_ a narrow escape!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; and now for the garden!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this before, never!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And I declare it s too bad, that it is!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
she was up to her chin in salt water.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by railway, she said to herself.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,0
I wish I hadn t cried so much!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,1,1,0
"That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"However, everything is queer to-day.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there s no harm in trying.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So she began: O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother s Latin Grammar, A mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse O mouse! )",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Perhaps it doesn t understand English, thought Alice; I daresay it s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"(For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So she began again: O est ma chatte?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, I beg your pardon!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I quite forgot you didn t like cats.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Not like cats!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Would _you_ like cats if you were me?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Well, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone: don t be angry about it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She is such a dear quiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh, I beg your pardon!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

We indeed!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1

"When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then I ll tell you my history, and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am older than you, and must know better; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
_I ll_ soon make you dry enough!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Ahem!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

Not I!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1

"I thought you did, said the Mouse.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I proceed.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable Found _what_?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Found _it_, the Mouse replied rather crossly: of course you know what it means.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"I don t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what s more, I don t believe you do either!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What _is_ a Caucus-race?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"At last the Dodo said, _Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

quite a chorus of voices asked.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, _she_, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, Prizes!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Prizes!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0

What else have you got in your pocket?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"he went on, turning to Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Hand it over here, said the Dodo.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this: Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come, I ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I ve nothing to do.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

You are not attending!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
said the Mouse to Alice severely.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What are you thinking of?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0

What a pity it wouldn t stay!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

CHAPTER IV.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself That s quite enough I hope I shan t grow any more As it is, I can t get out at the door I do wish I hadn t drunk quite so much!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alas!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
it was too late to wish that!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I can do no more, whatever happens.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What _will_ become of me?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

I think that will be the best plan.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Poor little thing!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And yet what a dear little puppy it was!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if if I d only been the right size to do it!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I d nearly forgotten that I ve got to grow up again!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Let me see how _is_ it to be managed?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"The great question certainly was, what?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Who are _you?_ said the Caterpillar.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Alice replied, rather shyly, I I hardly know, sir, just at present at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What do you mean by that?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
said the Caterpillar sternly.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Explain yourself!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"I can t explain _myself_, I m afraid, sir, said Alice, because I m not myself, you see.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t see, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I m afraid I can t put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely, for I can t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It isn t, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, perhaps you haven t found it so yet, said Alice; but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day, you know and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you ll feel it a little queer, won t you?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Not a bit, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice; all I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
You!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
said the Caterpillar contemptuously.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Who are _you?_ Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Why?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
said the Caterpillar.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Come back!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
the Caterpillar called after her.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I ve something important to say!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Is that all?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1

"No, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you think you re changed, do you?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I m afraid I am, sir, said Alice; I can t remember things as I used and I don t keep the same size for ten minutes together!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Can t remember _what_ things?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, I ve tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all came different!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Repeat, _You are old, Father William_, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice folded her hands, and began: You are old, Father William, the young man said, And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head Do you think, at your age, it is right?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In my youth, Father William replied to his son, I feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I m perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door Pray, what is the reason of that?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment one shilling the box Allow me to sell you a couple?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak Pray, how did you manage to do it?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In my youth, said his father, I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose What made you so awfully clever?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough, Said his father; don t give yourself airs!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Be off, or I ll kick you down stairs!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"That is not said right, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Not _quite_ right, I m afraid, said Alice, timidly; some of the words have got altered.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What size do you want to be?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
it asked.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Oh, I m not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied; only one doesn t like changing so often, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I _don t_ know, said the Caterpillar.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Are you content now?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn t mind, said Alice: three inches is such a wretched height to be.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
It is a very good height indeed!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
But I m not used to it!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And she thought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_ thought Alice to herself.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
And now which is which?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What _can_ all that green stuff be?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said Alice.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
And where _have_ my shoulders got to?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can t see you?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Serpent!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
screamed the Pigeon.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I m _not_ a serpent!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Serpent, I say again!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, I ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I haven t the least idea what you re talking about, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ve tried the roots of trees, and I ve tried banks, and I ve tried hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; but those serpents!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
There s no pleasing them!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"As if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon; but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, I haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I m very sorry you ve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And just as I d taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Ugh, Serpent!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

I can see you re trying to invent something!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I I m a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
A likely story indeed!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"No, no!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
You re a serpent; and there s no use denying it.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful child; but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t believe it, said the Pigeon; but if they do, why then they re a kind of serpent, that s all I can say.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, You re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It matters a good deal to _me_, said Alice hastily; but I m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn t want _yours_: I don t like them raw.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, be off, then!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish) and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There s no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for two reasons.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"First, because I m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on without attending to her, if we had the door between us.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But perhaps he can t help it, she said to herself; his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
But at any rate he might answer questions.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How am I to get in?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"she repeated, aloud.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
_Are_ you to get in at all?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the Footman.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"That s the first question, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
It s enough to drive one crazy!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for days and days.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
But what am _I_ to do?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, there s no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately: he s perfectly idiotic!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And she opened the door and went in.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
There s certainly too much pepper in that soup!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
There was certainly too much of it in the air.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why your cat grins like that?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and that s why.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
Pig!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again: I didn t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn t know that cats _could_ grin.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They all can, said the Duchess; and most of em do.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You don t know much, said the Duchess; and that s a fact.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, _please_ mind what you re doing!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Which would _not_ be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I Oh, don t bother _me_, said the Duchess; I never could abide figures!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
CHORUS.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
(In which the cook and the baby joined): Wow!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
wow!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words: I speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"you may nurse it a bit, if you like!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, just like a star-fish, thought Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"If I don t take this child away with me, thought Alice, they re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Don t grunt, said Alice; that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But perhaps it was only sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"No, there were no tears.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"If you re going to turn into a pig, my dear, said Alice, seriously, I ll have nothing more to do with you.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Mind now!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"If it had grown up, she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Cheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come, it s pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I don t much care where said Alice.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then it doesn t matter which way you go, said the Cat.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"so long as I get _somewhere_, Alice added as an explanation.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, you re sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long enough.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What sort of people live about here?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In _that_ direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives a Hatter: and in _that_ direction, waving the other paw, lives a March Hare.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Visit either you like: they re both mad.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But I don t want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, you can t help that, said the Cat: we re all mad here.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I m mad.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
You re mad.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,0
How do you know I m mad?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldn t have come here.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Alice didn t think that proved it at all; however, she went on And how do you know that you re mad?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"To begin with, said the Cat, a dog s not mad.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
You grant that?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"I suppose so, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Well, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when it s angry, and wags its tail when it s pleased.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Now _I_ growl when I m pleased, and wag my tail when I m angry.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Therefore I m mad.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"_I_ call it purring, not growling, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Call it what you like, said the Cat.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I should like it very much, said Alice, but I haven t been invited yet.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ll see me there, said the Cat, and vanished.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the Cat.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I d nearly forgotten to ask.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"It turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ve seen hatters before, she said to herself; the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in March.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Did you say pig, or fig?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I said pig, replied Alice; and I wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"All right, said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"I ve often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice; but a grin without a cat!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
It s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I almost wish I d gone to see the Hatter instead!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
CHAPTER VII.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice; only, as it s asleep, I suppose it doesn t mind.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: No room!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
No room!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
they cried out when they saw Alice coming.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
There s _plenty_ of room!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Have some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"I don t see any wine, she remarked.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There isn t any, said the March Hare.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said the March Hare.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I didn t know it was _your_ table, said Alice; it s laid for a great many more than three.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Your hair wants cutting, said the Hatter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some severity; it s very rude.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_ was, Why is a raven like a writing-desk?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come, we shall have some fun now!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I m glad they ve begun asking riddles.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I believe I can guess that, she added aloud.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the March Hare.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Exactly so, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I do, Alice hastily replied; at least at least I mean what I say that s the same thing, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
Not the same thing a bit!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
said the Hatter.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
You might just as well say that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see !,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like what I get is the same thing as I get what I like !",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing as I sleep when I breathe !",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It _is_ the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn t much.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
The Hatter was the first to break the silence.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What day of the month is it?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Alice considered a little, and then said The fourth.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Two days wrong!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
sighed the Hatter.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
I told you butter wouldn t suit the works!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
he added looking angrily at the March Hare.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"It was the _best_ butter, the March Hare meekly replied.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled: you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, It was the _best_ butter, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
What a funny watch!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
she remarked.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"It tells the day of the month, and doesn t tell what o clock it is!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
Why should it?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
muttered the Hatter.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
Does _your_ watch tell you what year it is?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Of course not, Alice replied very readily: but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Which is just the case with _mine_, said the Hatter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"The Hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t quite understand you, she said, as politely as she could.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Have you guessed the riddle yet?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Nor I, said the March Hare.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice sighed wearily.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

Where did they draw the treacle from?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

Alice was silent.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1

"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat s head with great curiosity.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s a friend of mine a Cheshire Cat, said Alice: allow me to introduce it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t like the look of it at all, said the King: however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I d rather not, the Cat remarked.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Don t be impertinent, said the King, and don t look at me like that!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
He got behind Alice as he spoke.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"A cat may look at a king, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ve read that in some book, but I don t remember where.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I wish you would have this cat removed!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"she said, without even looking round.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"I ll fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So she went in search of her hedgehog.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: but it doesn t matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The executioner s argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn t going to begin at _his_ time of life.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The King s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Queen s argument was, that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed, all round.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.),0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the Duchess: you d better ask _her_ about it.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"She s in prison, the Queen said to the executioner: fetch her here.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And the executioner went off like an arrow.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
CHAPTER IX.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Mock Turtle s Story You can t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice s, and they walked off together.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"When _I m_ a Duchess, she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), I won t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Soup does very well without Maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn t be so stingy about it, you know She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I can t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Perhaps it hasn t one, Alice ventured to remark.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Tut, tut, child!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
said the Duchess.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Everything s got a moral, if only you can find it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice s side as she spoke.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"The game s going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Tis so, said the Duchess: and the moral of that is Oh, tis love, tis love, that makes the world go round!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Somebody said, Alice whispered, that it s done by everybody minding their own business!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Ah, well!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice s shoulder as she added, and the moral of _that_ is Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
How fond she is of finding morals in things!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice thought to herself.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"I dare say you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist, the Duchess said after a pause: the reason is, that I m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Shall I try the experiment?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"He might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Very true, said the Duchess: flamingoes and mustard both bite.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And the moral of that is Birds of a feather flock together.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Only mustard isn t a bird, Alice remarked.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Right, as usual, said the Duchess: what a clear way you have of putting things!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s a mineral, I _think_, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; there s a large mustard-mine near here.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And the moral of that is The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, I know!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, it s a vegetable.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It doesn t look like one, but it is.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I quite agree with you, said the Duchess; and the moral of that is Be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simply Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely, if I had it written down: but I can t quite follow it as you say it.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"That s nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, don t talk about trouble!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I make you a present of everything I ve said as yet.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
A cheap sort of present!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I m glad they don t give birthday presents like that!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
But she did not venture to say it out loud.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
Thinking again?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ve a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Just about as much right, said the Duchess, as pigs have to fly; and the m But here, to Alice s great surprise, the Duchess s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"A fine day, your Majesty!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Now, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Take your choice!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Let s go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting Off with his head!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"No, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
I don t even know what a Mock Turtle is.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history, As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, You are all pardoned.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Come, _that s_ a good thing!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Up, lazy thing!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What fun!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What _is_ the fun?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Why, _she_, said the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Come on!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
Everybody says come on!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0

"They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
She pitied him deeply.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
What is his sorrow?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1
"she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, It s all his fancy, that: he hasn t got no sorrow, you know.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"This here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your history, she do.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I ll tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: sit down, both of you, and don t speak a word till I ve finished.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice thought to herself, I don t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn t begin.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
But she waited patiently.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Once, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real Turtle.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"When we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn t one?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"We called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle angrily: really you are very dull!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Don t be all day about it!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0

The Mock Turtle went on.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"We had the best of educations in fact, we went to school every day _I ve_ been to a day-school, too, said Alice; you needn t be so proud as all that.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
With extras?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

I couldn t afford to learn it.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

Never heard of uglifying!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What was _that_ like?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Well, I can t show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said: I m too stiff.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And the Gryphon never learnt it.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

What a curious plan!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0

"So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly: Will you walk a little faster?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said a whiting to a snail.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"There s a porpoise close behind us, and he s treading on my tail.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
They are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But the snail replied Too far, too far!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"and gave a look askance Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What matters it how far we go?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
his scaly friend replied.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"The further off from England the nearer is to France Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, they you ve seen them, of course?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Yes, said Alice, I ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I don t know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if you ve seen them so often, of course you know what they re like.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
They have their tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You re wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle: crumbs would all wash off in the sea.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The reason is, said the Gryphon, that they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So they got thrown out to sea.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So they had to fall a long way.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So they got their tails fast in their mouths.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So they couldn t get them out again.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
That s all.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Thank you, said Alice, it s very interesting.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I never knew so much about a whiting before.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Do you know why it s called a whiting?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I never thought about it, said Alice.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"_It does the boots and shoes_, the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice was thoroughly puzzled.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Does the boots and shoes!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
she repeated in a wondering tone.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the Gryphon.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I mean, what makes them so shiny?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They re done with blacking, I believe.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, are done with a whiting.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Now you know.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
And what are they made of?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: any shrimp could have told you that.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"If I d been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, I d have said to the porpoise, Keep back, please: we don t want _you_ with us!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said: no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Wouldn t it really?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said Alice in a tone of great surprise.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Of course not, said the Mock Turtle: why, if a fish came to _me_, and told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Don t you mean purpose ?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And the Gryphon added Come, let s hear some of _your_ adventures.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning, said Alice a little timidly: but it s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: explanations take such a dreadful time.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went on.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating _You are old, Father William_, to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said That s very curious.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It s all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
It all came different!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I should like to hear her try and repeat something now.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
Tell her to begin.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Stand up and repeat _Tis the voice of the sluggard_, said the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
thought Alice; I might as well be at school at once.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed: Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"[later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"That s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child, said the Gryphon.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle; but it sounds uncommon nonsense.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She can t explain it, said the Gryphon hastily.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Go on with the next verse.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
But about his toes?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
the Mock Turtle persisted.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"How _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
It s the first position in dancing.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently: it begins _I passed by his garden_.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice: I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet ] What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle interrupted, if you don t explain it as you go on?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
It s by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Yes, I think you d better leave off, said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
the Gryphon went on.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, Hm!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
No accounting for tastes!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Sing her _Turtle Soup_, will you, old fellow?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this: Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

What trial is it?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered Come on!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

CHAPTER XI.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Who Stole the Tarts?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them I wish they d get the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"That s the judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"And that s the jury-box, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures, (she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) I suppose they are the jurors.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"However, jury-men would have done just as well.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
What are they doing?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Alice whispered to the Gryphon.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They can t have anything to put down yet, before the trial s begun.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"They re putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply, for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Stupid things!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the court!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down stupid things!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
A nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"This of course, Alice could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Herald, read the accusation!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
said the King.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Consider your verdict, the King said to the jury.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Not yet, not yet!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
the Rabbit hastily interrupted.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
There s a great deal to come before that!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Call the first witness, said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
The first witness was the Hatter.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I beg pardon, your Majesty, he began, for bringing these in: but I hadn t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ought to have finished, said the King.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
When did you begin?,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it was, he said.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"Sixteenth, added the Dormouse.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Write that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Take off your hat, the King said to the Hatter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It isn t mine, said the Hatter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"_Stolen!_ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation; I ve none of my own.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I m a hatter.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Give your evidence, said the King; and don t be nervous, or I ll have you executed on the spot.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
I wish you wouldn t squeeze so.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
I can hardly breathe.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"I can t help it, said Alice very meekly: I m growing.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You ve no right to grow _here_, said the Dormouse.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Don t talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly: you know you re growing too.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse: not in that ridiculous fashion.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"I m a poor man, your Majesty, the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, and I hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea The twinkling of the _what?_ said the King.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"It _began_ with the tea, the Hatter replied.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
Of course twinkling begins with a T!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
You did!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,1
I deny it!,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,0,1,0
"He denies it, said the King: leave out that part.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"After that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more bread-and-butter But what did the Dormouse say?",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
one of the jury asked.,0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"That I can t remember, said the Hatter.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"You _must_ remember, remarked the King, or I ll have you executed.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

"cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0
"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,1,1,1,1

"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle s heavy sobs.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,1
"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.",0,The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland,0,0,1,0

PART ONE Chapter 1 Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys house.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at his usual hour, that is, at eight o clock in the morning, not in his wife s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He turned over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it was nice, very nice.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There was a great deal more that was delightful, only there s no putting it into words, or even expressing it in one s thoughts awake.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, as he had done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Oo!...,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1

"Oh, oh, oh!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and indignation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What s this?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
this?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even anything would have been better than what he did do his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology) utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Catching sight of that smile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

All he repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children, and himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect on her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had never clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble Moscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"All the members of that family, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were, wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were audible in their brother s room above, where the students used to work; why they were visited by those professors of French literature, of music, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was they had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly, but she was soon married to Oblonsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a man of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to make the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But Levin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But he (he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country gentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building barns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out well, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world, is done by people fit for nothing else.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary, in no way striking person.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he supposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and, still more, a distinguished man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but he did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional women.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant s rest; that he could not live without deciding the question, would she or would she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"As he listened to his brother s argument with the professor, he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they promptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to authorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I cannot admit it, said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual clearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I maintain the contrary, began Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness than the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said: That question we have no right to answer as yet.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We have not the requisite data, chimed in the professor, and he went back to his argument.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No one would believe it, but it came to pass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And she s on your side.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How do you mean?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
It s not only that she likes you she says that Kitty is certain to be your wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At these words Levin s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile not far from tears of emotion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She says that!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
cried Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"I always said she was exquisite, your wife.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There, that s enough, enough said about it, he said, getting up from his seat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All right, but do sit down.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But Levin could not sit down.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall, and only then sat down to the table.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"You must understand, said he, it s not love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve been in love, but it s not that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has taken possession of me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I went away, you see, because I made up my mind that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not come on earth; but I ve struggled with myself, I see there s no living without it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And it must be settled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What did you go away for?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ah, stop a minute!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The questions one must ask oneself!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Listen.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
You can t imagine what you ve done for me by what you said.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m so happy that I ve become positively hateful; I ve forgotten everything.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I heard today that my brother Nikolay ... you know, he s here ...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I had even forgotten him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
It seems to me that he s happy too.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
It s a sort of madness.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But one thing s awful....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Here, you ve been married, you know the feeling ... it s awful that we old with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it s loathsome, and that s why one can t help feeling oneself unworthy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, well, you ve not many sins on your conscience.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alas!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"all the same, said Levin, when with loathing I go over my life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Yes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
What would you have?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The world s made so, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: Forgive me not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy loving-kindness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s the only way she can forgive me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 11 Levin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There s one other thing I ought to tell you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Do you know Vronsky?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I don t. Why do you ask?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Give us another bottle, Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was not wanted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he s one of your rivals.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Who s Vronsky?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Levin, and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I made his acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came there for the levy of recruits.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Fearfully rich, handsome, great connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice, good-natured fellow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he s more than simply a good-natured fellow, as I ve found out here he s a cultivated man, too, and very intelligent; he s a man who ll make his mark.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin scowled and was dumb.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, he turned up here soon after you d gone, and as I can see, he s over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her mother....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, but I know nothing, said Levin, frowning gloomily.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And immediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was to have been able to forget him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You wait a bit, wait a bit, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and touching his hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I believe the chances are in your favor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be, pursued Oblonsky, filling up his glass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, thanks, I can t drink any more, said Levin, pushing away his glass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he went on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tonight I don t advise you to speak, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Go round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless you.... Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come next spring, do, said Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A feeling such as his was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the suppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He knew what was passing in Levin s soul.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll come some day, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But women, my boy, they re the pivot everything turns upon.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Things are in a bad way with me, very bad.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And it s all through women.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tell me frankly now, he pursued, picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass; give me your advice.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, what is it?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
I ll tell you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Suppose you re married, you love your wife, but you re fascinated by another woman....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, but I m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I can t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a baker s shop and steal a roll.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled more than usual.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
A roll will sometimes smell so good one can t resist it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Himmlisch ist s, wenn ich bezwungen Meine irdische Begier; Aber doch wenn s nich gelungen Hatt ich auch recht h bsch Plaisir!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, too, could not help smiling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but joking apart, resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch, you must understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and lonely, and has sacrificed everything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, when the thing s done, don t you see, can one possibly cast her off?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Even supposing one parts from her, so as not to break up one s family life, still, can one help feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, you must excuse me there.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
You know to me all women are divided into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and there are ...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never shall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women are the same.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But the Magdalen?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ah, drop that!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
Christ would never have said those words if He had known how they would be abused.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Of all the Gospel those words are the only ones remembered.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"However, I m not saying so much what I think, as what I feel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I have a loathing for fallen women.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You re afraid of spiders, and I of these vermin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Most likely you ve not made a study of spiders and don t know their character; and so it is with me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s very well for you to talk like that; it s very much like that gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But to deny the facts is no answer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What s to be done you tell me that, what s to be done?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Your wife gets older, while you re full of life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Before you ve time to look round, you feel that you can t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And then all at once love turns up, and you re done for, done for, Stepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin half smiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, you re done for, resumed Oblonsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Don t steal rolls.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, moralist!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"But you must understand, there are two women; one insists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you can t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What are you to do?,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
How are you to act?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There s a fearful tragedy in it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I ll tell you that I don t believe there was any tragedy about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And this is why.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato defines in his Banquet, served as the test of men.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Some men only understand one sort, and some only the other.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And those who only know the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In such love there can be no sort of tragedy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m much obliged for the gratification, my humble respects that s all the tragedy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And in platonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is clear and pure, because.... At that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he added unexpectedly: But perhaps you are right.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Very likely ...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I don t know, I don t know.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"It s this, don t you see, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, you re very much all of a piece.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s your strong point and your failing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You have a character that s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but that s not how it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You despise public official work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all the while with the aim and that s not how it is.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You want a man s work, too, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to be undivided and that s not how it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin sighed and made no reply.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was thinking of his own affairs, and did not hear Oblonsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though they had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn them closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they had nothing to do with one another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy, coming on after dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Bill!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And at once in the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd kopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have been horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen roubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go to the Shtcherbatskys there to decide his fate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 12 The young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was the first winter that she had been out in the world.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even than her mother had anticipated.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To say nothing of the young men who danced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two serious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance: Levin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits, and evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations between Kitty s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The prince was on Levin s side; he said he wished for nothing better for Kitty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The princess for her part, going round the question in the manner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that Levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that Kitty felt no great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she did not state the principal point, which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter, and that Levin was not to her liking, and she did not understand him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Levin had abruptly departed, the princess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly: You see I was right.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more delighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a good, but a brilliant match.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In the mother s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and his queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with her daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he were waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not realize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And suddenly, without doing so, he disappeared.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"It s as well he s not attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him, thought the mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vronsky satisfied all the mother s desires.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Very wealthy, clever, of aristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court, and a fascinating man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Nothing better could be wished for.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came continually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, in spite of that, the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her aunt arranging the match.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her husband, about whom everything was well known beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked at.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That impression had been favorable.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Afterwards, on a day fixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and accepted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All had passed very simply and easily.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So it seemed, at least, to the princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of marrying off one s daughters.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The panics that had been lived through, the thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been wasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls, Darya and Natalia!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, since the youngest had come out, she was going through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old prince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was irrationally jealous over his daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his favorite.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
At every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more ground for the prince s touchiness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society, that a mother s duties had become still more difficult.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She saw that girls of Kitty s age formed some sort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men s society; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey, and, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly convinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not their parents .",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Marriages aren t made nowadays as they used to be, was thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their elders.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn from anyone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The French fashion of the parents arranging their children s future was not accepted; it was condemned.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The English fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted, and not possible in Russian society.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The Russian fashion of matchmaking by the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered unseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them, no one knew.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing: Mercy on us, it s high time in our day to cast off all that old-fashioned business.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s the young people have to marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was very easy for anyone to say that who had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have been unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable playthings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And so the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her elder sisters.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She saw that her daughter was in love with him, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man, and would not do this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But at the same time she knew how easy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl s head, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The week before, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with Vronsky during a mazurka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This conversation had partly reassured the princess; but perfectly at ease she could not be.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vronsky had told Kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my mother s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate, he told her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But her mother saw them in a different light.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She knew that the old lady was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her son s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer through fear of vexing his mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"However, she was so anxious for the marriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she believed it was so.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her husband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter s fate engrossed all her feelings.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Today, with Levin s reappearance, a fresh source of anxiety arose.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was afraid that her daughter, who had at one time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme sense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin s arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, has he been here long?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"the princess asked about Levin, as they returned home.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He came today, mamma.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"There s one thing I want to say.... began the princess, and from her serious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Mamma, she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her, please, please don t say anything about that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I know, I know all about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her mother s wishes wounded her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I only want to say that to raise hopes.... Mamma, darling, for goodness sake, don t talk about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s so horrible to talk about it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I won t, said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter s eyes; but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You won t?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Never, mamma, none, answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking her mother straight in the face, but there s no use in my telling you anything, and I ...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ... if I wanted to, I don t know what to say or how....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I don t know.... No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes, thought the mother, smiling at her agitation and happiness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The princess smiled that what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor child so immense and so important.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 13 After dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling a sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her heart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first time, would be a turning point in her life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And she was continually picturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both together.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with tenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The memories of childhood and of Levin s friendship with her dead brother gave a special poetic charm to her relations with him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You know what I shall say.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But I want to hear your opinion.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You do not admit the conceivability at all?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I don t see why there should not be a new force, if it.... Why, because with electricity, Levin interrupted again, every time you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to change the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But what of him?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Kitty looked at him and was filled with terror.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna s face she saw in him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial conversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0

"The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in fog in Kitty s soul.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

She felt crushed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
She went to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low chair.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan, and with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don t know you and don t want to know you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What is it you want?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"I didn t want to see you for anything, he answered timidly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

That s the beginning of a new thing we re going into.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s a productive association.... Konstantin scarcely heard him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He looked into his sickly, consumptive face, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Nikolay Levin went on talking: You know that capital oppresses the laborer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The laborers with us, the peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however much they work they can t escape from their position of beasts of burden.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education, all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And society s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of burden to the end.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And that state of things must be changed, he finished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, of course, said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother s projecting cheekbones.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so we re founding a locksmiths association, where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

asked Konstantin Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why in a village?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the villages, I think, there is plenty of work as it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why a locksmiths association in a village?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were, and that s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don t like people to try and get them out of their slavery, said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the objection.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch s aristocratic views.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Because I didn t see the use of wasting my time over it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That article s too deep for many people that s to say it s over their heads.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But with me, it s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I know where its weakness lies.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Everyone was mute.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He thought it natural because he did it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as he did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely as a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors had studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned the same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor was a bad doctor, in the princess s household and circle it was for some reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special knowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Conceited blockhead!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But we may suspect it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The question stands thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in these cases, the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
it is.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The one is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides at once.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And how about a tour abroad?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

I ve no liking for foreign tours.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"What is wanted is means of improving nutrition, and not for lowering it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily on the ground that they could do no harm.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And then the mother wishes it, he added.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Don t talk of it!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Please, don t talk of it!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But who can have told you so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
No one has said that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m certain he was in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it hadn t.... Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Dolly knew this trick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited; she knew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and Dolly would have soothed her, but it was too late.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said Kitty quickly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0

"And this is said to me by my own sister, who imagines that ... that ... that she s sympathizing with me!...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I don t want these condolences and humbug!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty, you re unjust.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why are you tormenting me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But I ... quite the contrary ...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I see you re unhappy....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
I ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I am too proud ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Tell me the truth, said Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand: tell me, did Levin speak to you?...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The mention of Levin s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige of self-control.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp on the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said: Why bring Levin in too?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and never, _never_ would I do as you re doing go back to a man who s deceived you, who has cared for another woman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I can t understand it!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"You may, but I can t!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly sat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of the room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her face in her handkerchief.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a peculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery of mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters, the sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in their minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they understood each other.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in anger about her husband s infidelity and her humiliating position had cut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Dolly for her part knew all she had wanted to find out.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She felt certain that her surmises were correct; that Kitty s misery, her inconsolable misery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer and she had refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was fully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty said not a word of that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I have nothing to make me miserable, she said, getting calmer; but can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome, coarse to me, and I myself most of all?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can t tell you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s not unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple joy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And then!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"The doctor.... Then.... Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch had become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see him without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her imagination.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most loathsome light, she went on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s my illness.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Perhaps it will pass off.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 4 The highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows everyone else, everyone even visits everyone else.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But this great set has its subdivisions.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles of this highest society.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One circle was her husband s government official set, consisting of his colleagues and subordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious manner, and belonging to different social strata.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Anna found it difficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence which she had at first entertained for these persons.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now she knew all of them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She knew their relations with one another and with the head authorities, knew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and where they agreed and disagreed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the circle of political, masculine interests had never interested her, in spite of countess Lidia Ivanovna s influence, and she avoided it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one by means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The center of this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was a set made up of elderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and ambitious men.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
One of the clever people belonging to the set had called it the conscience of Petersburg society.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch had the highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her special gift for getting on with everyone, had in the early days of her life in Petersburg made friends in this circle also.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, since her return from Moscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to her that both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt so bored and ill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia Ivanovna as little as possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the fashionable world the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses, the world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid sinking to the level of the demi-monde.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For the demi-monde the members of that fashionable world believed that they despised, though their tastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her connection with this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya, her cousin s wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first came out, showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making fun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna s coterie.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When I m old and ugly I ll be the same, Betsy used to say; but for a pretty young woman like you it s early days for that house of charity.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya s world, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and besides in her heart she preferred the first circle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But since her visit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She avoided her serious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There she met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy s for Betsy was a Vronsky by birth and his cousin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of meeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She gave him no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up in her heart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved her lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this delight.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at a _soir e_ where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him there, she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she had been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the fashionable world was in the theater.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Vronsky looked inquiringly at her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She nodded.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"He thanked her by a smile, and sat down beside her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But how I remember your jeers!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"continued Princess Betsy, who took a peculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What s become of all that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

I begin to lose hope.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, whatever hope can you have?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Betsy, offended on behalf of her friend.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
_Entendons nous...._ But in her eyes there were gleams of light that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he did what hope he might have.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"None whatever, said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows of teeth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, he added, taking an opera-glass out of her hand, and proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes facing them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m afraid I m becoming ridiculous.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was very well aware that in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or of any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the position of a man pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking his life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand about it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera-glass and looked at his cousin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why was it you didn t come to dinner?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"she said, admiring him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And she sat down again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Chapter 5 This is rather indiscreet, but it s so good it s an awful temptation to tell the story, said Vronsky, looking at her with his laughing eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Love, she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at the very instant she unhooked the lace, she added, Why I don t like the word is that it means too much to me, far more than you can understand, and she glanced into his face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"_Au revoir!_ She gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

He made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually did, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at the place where he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one o clock, just as he usually did.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But from time to time he rubbed his high forehead and shook his head, as though to drive away something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

"But now, when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself, it seemed to him very complicated and difficult.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Jealousy according to his notions was an insult to one s wife, and one ought to have confidence in one s wife.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why one ought to have confidence that is to say, complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had no experience of lack of confidence, because he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to have it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and irrational, and did not know what was to be done.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch was standing face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife s loving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very irrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All his life Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres, having to do with the reflection of life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken, and that there is a chasm below.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That chasm was life itself, the bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his wife s loving someone else, and he was horrified at it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning, over the carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was reflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and across her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits of her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her writing-table, that he knew so well.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door, and turned back again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At each turn in his walk, especially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he halted and said to himself, Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must express my view of it and my decision.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he turned back again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But express what what decision?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he said to himself in the drawing-room, and he found no reply.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But after all, he asked himself before turning into the boudoir, what has occurred?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She was talking a long while with him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But what of that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
Surely women in society can talk to whom they please.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and her, he told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum, which had always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and no meaning at all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but as he entered the dark drawing-room some inner voice told him that it was not so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he said to himself again in the dining-room, Yes, I must decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it.... And again at the turn in the drawing-room he asked himself, Decide how?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And again he asked himself, What had occurred?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"and answered, Nothing, and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced that something had happened.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His thoughts, like his body, went round a complete circle, without coming upon anything new.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He noticed this, rubbed his forehead, and sat down in her boudoir.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He began to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas, her desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate life of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
To put himself in thought and feeling in another person s place was a spiritual exercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He looked on this spiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the worst of it all, thought he, is that just now, at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion (he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time), when I stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid worry should fall foul of me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind, he said aloud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in her soul, that s not my affair; that s the affair of her conscience, and falls under the head of religion, he said to himself, feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so, Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, questions as to her feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can have nothing to do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
My duty is clearly defined.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As the head of the family, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I perceive, to warn her, even to use my authority.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ought to speak plainly to her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch s head.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Thinking over what he would say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for it, but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly, exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be, reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly, reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, interlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the joints of the fingers cracked.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of his fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, so needful to him at this juncture.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alexey Alexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

One joint cracked.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that she was close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt frightened of the explanation confronting him.... Chapter 9 Anna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of brightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"How simple and natural were her words, and how likely that she was simply sleepy!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
She felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna, I must warn you, he began.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Warn me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Of what?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"She looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural, either in the sound or the sense of her words.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But to him, knowing her, knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she noticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy, every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once; to him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind, that she did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had always hitherto lain open before him, were closed against him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"More than that, he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were said straight out to him: Yes, it s shut up, and so it must be, and will be in future.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have, returning home and finding his own house locked up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But perhaps the key may yet be found, thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I want to warn you, he said in a low voice, that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Your too animated conversation this evening with Count Vronsky (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate emphasis) attracted attention.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

She lifted up that hand and kissed it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid it, and said nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At last, as though making an effort over herself, she got up and pushed him away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her face was still as beautiful, but it was only the more pitiful for that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All is over, she said; I have nothing but you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Remember that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I can never forget what is my whole life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
For one instant of this happiness.... Happiness!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For pity s sake, not a word, not a word more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She rose quickly and moved away from him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not a word more, she repeated, and with a look of chill despair, incomprehensible to him, she parted from him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"She felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and of horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to speak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But later too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She said to herself: No, just now I can t think of it, later on, when I am calmer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But this calm for thought never came; every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her, and what she ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Later, later, she said when I am calmer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
One dream haunted her almost every night.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She dreamed that both were her husbands at once, that both were lavishing caresses on her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch was weeping, kissing her hands, and saying, How happy we are now!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And Alexey Vronsky was there too, and he too was her husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her, was explaining to them, laughing, that this was ever so much simpler, and that now both of them were happy and contented.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare, and she awoke from it in terror.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"Chapter 12 In the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin shuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he said to himself: This was just how I used to shudder and blush, thinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not get my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had mismanaged that affair of my sister s that was entrusted to me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And yet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
It will be the same thing too with this trouble.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it; and it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first days.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and was further than ever from marriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was painfully conscious himself, as were all about him, that at his years it is not well for man to be alone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had once said to his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he liked talking to: Well, Nikolay!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I mean to get married, and how Nikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt: And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But marriage had now become further off than ever.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The place was taken, and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place, he felt that it was utterly impossible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a similar kind, made him twinge and blush.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There had been in his past, as in every man s, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his conscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil actions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but humiliating reminiscences.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
These wounds never healed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And with these memories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which he must have appeared to others that evening.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But time and work did their part.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the incidents paltry in his eyes, but really important of his country life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Every week he thought less often of Kitty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married, hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and treacheries of spring, one of those rare springs in which plants, beasts, and man rejoice alike.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This lovely spring roused Levin still more, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out, still his most important resolution that of purity had been kept by him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was free from that shame, which had usually harassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna telling him that his brother Nikolay s health was getting worse, but that he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin went to Moscow to his brother s and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He succeeded so well in persuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that matter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In addition to his farming, which called for special attention in spring, and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the data of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a certain unalterable character of the laborer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Thus, in spite of his solitude, or in consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly full.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"With her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of agriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea Mihalovna s favorite subject.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Spring was slow in unfolding.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
For the last few weeks it had been steadily fine frosty weather.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but at night there were even seven degrees of frost.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There was such a frozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the roads.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Easter came in the snow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday, a warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days and three nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On Thursday the wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and floating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the following Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds split up into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the real spring had come.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly wore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the warm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened earth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its tiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the sticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was humming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by the pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering their spring calls.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had not grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round their bleating mothers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Nimble children ran about the drying paths, covered with the prints of bare feet.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There was a merry chatter of peasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the yard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The real spring had come.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 13 Levin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket, instead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Spring is the time of plans and projects.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, as he came out into the farmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds, hardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the farm work that was so dear to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
First of all he went to the cattle.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides were already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow, and the calves to be let into the paddock.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a peasant s cow, and Pava s daughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling Levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the paddock.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during the winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He sent for the carpenter, who, according to his orders, ought to have been at work at the thrashing machine.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was very annoying to Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The hurdles, as he ascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the cart-horses stable; and there broken, as they were of light construction, only meant for feeding calves.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair, and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went off himself to look for him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The bailiff, beaming all over, like everyone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of the barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why isn t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Here it s time they got to work in the fields.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But what were they doing in the winter, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But what did you want the carpenter for?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Where are the hurdles for the calves paddock?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ordered them to be got ready.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What would you have with those peasants!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s not those peasants but this bailiff!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Levin, getting angry.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, what do I keep you for?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he cried.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"But, bethinking himself that this would not help matters, he stopped short in the middle of a sentence, and merely sighed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Can sowing begin?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he asked, after a pause.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the clover?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they re sowing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only I don t know if they ll manage to get through; it s so slushy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How many acres?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
About fifteen.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why not sow all?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the forty-five, was still more annoying to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Clover, as he knew, both from books and from his own experience, never did well except when it was sown as early as possible, almost in the snow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And yet Levin could never get this done.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There s no one to send.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What would you have with such a set of peasants?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Three haven t turned up.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And there s Semyon.... Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so I have, as it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Where are the peasants, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Five are making comp te (which meant compost), four are shifting the oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin knew very well that a touch of mildew meant that his English seed oats were already ruined.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Again they had not done as he had ordered.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes, he cried.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Don t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the oats, and then to the stable.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The oats were not yet spoiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the peasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be done, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got over his vexation with the bailiff.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Indeed, it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Ignat!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked up, was washing the carriage wheels, saddle me....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Which, sir?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Well, let it be Kolpik.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff, who was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began talking to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans for the farm.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done before the early mowing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the ploughing of the further land to go on without a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the mowing to be all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer s projects.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That look said: That s all very well, but as God wills.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They had all taken up that attitude to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but mortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it seemed, elemental force continually ranged against him, for which he could find no other expression than as God wills.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, said the bailiff.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why ever shouldn t you manage it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
We positively must have another fifteen laborers.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And they don t turn up.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin was silent.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Again he was brought face to face with that opposing force.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more than forty thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight laborers for a reasonable sum.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But still he could not help struggling against it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don t come we must look for them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, I ll send, to be sure, said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But there are the horses, too, they re not good for much.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
We ll get some more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I know, of course, Levin added laughing, you always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but this year I m not going to let you have things your own way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ll see to everything myself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, I don t think you take much rest as it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It cheers us up to work under the master s eye....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So they re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll go and have a look at them, he said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik, who was led up by the coachman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You can t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, the coachman shouted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All right, I ll go by the forest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country, his good little horse, after his long inactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and asking, as it were, for guidance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If Levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob, drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he rode through his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in parts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree, with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he came out of the forest, in the immense plain before him, his grass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare place or swamp, only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a peasant he met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked, Well, Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We must get the ploughing done first, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, answered Ipat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The further he rode, the happier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up into six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and four hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so as not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A cart with the seed in it was standing, not at the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Both the laborers were sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The earth in the cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder, but crusted together or adhering in clods.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seeing the master, the laborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work sowing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin seldom lost his temper.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s all right, sir, it ll spring up again, responded Vassily.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Please don t argue, said Levin, but do as you re told.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, sir, answered Vassily, and he took the horse s head.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What a sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, he said, hesitating; first rate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only it s a work to get about!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why is it you have earth that s not sifted?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, we crumble it up, answered Vassily, taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with unsifted earth, but still it was annoying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his anger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that way now.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the sieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Where did you stop?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as best he could, scattering the seed on the land.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Walking was as difficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was in a great heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his method.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, you ll see in the summer time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It ll look different.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Look you where I sowed last spring.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 25 There were seventeen officers in all riding in this race.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The race course was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front of the pavilion.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the stream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the pavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an Irish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a mound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for the horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be killed); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and the end of the race was just facing the pavilion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"To the spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously, but to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value to them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and several horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream, Vronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged at the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of him Mahotin s chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving lightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and in front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than alive.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the motions of his mare.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same instant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to the other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the very moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw almost under his mare s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana on the further side of the stream.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"(Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he took the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.)",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

O the darling!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
thought Vronsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and began holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind Mahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five hundred yards that followed it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The Tsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at them at him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near the devil, as the solid barrier was called.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and keeping always the same distance ahead.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Gladiator rose, with no sound of knocking against anything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
With a wave of his short tail he disappeared from Vronsky s sight.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
cried a voice.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"At the same instant, under Vronsky s eyes, right before him flashed the palings of the barrier.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Without the slightest change in her action his mare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a crash behind him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The mare, excited by Gladiator s keeping ahead, had risen too soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind hoofs.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But her pace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face, realized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to overtake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts, without any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and began getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to the inner cord.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Mahotin would not let her pass that side.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky had hardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side, when Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other side.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Frou-Frou s shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was even with Gladiator s back.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
For a few lengths they moved evenly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But before the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the reins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly passed Mahotin just upon the declivity.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He caught a glimpse of his mud-stained face as he flashed by.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He even fancied that he smiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"Vronsky passed Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon him, and he never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid and still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily crossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator closer upon him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she easily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator s hoofs was again heard at the same distance away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as Cord had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His excitement, his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener and keener.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this, and tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same reserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There remained only one obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it ahead of the others he would come in first.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was flying towards the Irish barricade, Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in the distance, and both the man and the mare had a moment s hesitation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw the uncertainty in the mare s ears and lifted the whip, but at the same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what was wanted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had fancied she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the force of her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the same rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell back into her pace again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Bravo, Vronsky!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were his friends in the regiment who were standing at the obstacle.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
He could not fail to recognize Yashvin s voice though he did not see him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
O my sweet!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

"There remained only the last ditch, filled with water and five feet wide.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky did not even look at it, but anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins, lifting the mare s head and letting it go in time with her paces.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her neck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops on her mane, her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short, sharp gasps.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he knew that she had strength left more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was only from feeling himself nearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that Vronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She flew over the ditch as though not noticing it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She flew over it like a bird; but at the same instant Vronsky, to his horror, felt that he had failed to keep up with the mare s pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a fearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful had happened.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He just had time to free his leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain efforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the ground at his feet like a shot bird.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The clumsy movement made by Vronsky had broken her back.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But that he only knew much later.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At that moment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he stood staggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay gasping before him, bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Still unable to realize what had happened, Vronsky tugged at his mare s reins.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 26 The external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had remained unchanged.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The sole difference lay in the fact that he was more busily occupied than ever.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As in former years, at the beginning of the spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his health, deranged by the winter s work that every year grew heavier.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The steward did not take up much time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He simply gave Alexey Alexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of the position of his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as it had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses, more had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the doctor, a celebrated Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate acquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

His eyes rested upon Anna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her face was white and set.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She was obviously seeing nothing and no one but one man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The first fall Kuzovlev s, at the stream agitated everyone, but Alexey Alexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna s pale, triumphant face that the man she was watching had not fallen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When, after Mahotin and Vronsky had cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown straight on his head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror passed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did not even notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were talking of about her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But more and more often, and with greater persistence, he watched her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 29 Everyone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a phrase someone had uttered The lions and gladiators will be the next thing, and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when Vronsky fell to the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the way in it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But afterwards a change came over Anna s face which really was beyond decorum.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

This is beyond everything.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He merely saw the outward symptoms.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Mind, he said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He got up and pulled up the window.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He waited for her to answer, but she was silent, looking straight before her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There was a time when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that now.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was unhurt, but the horse had broken its back?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him, there was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer mockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly groundless.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready to believe anything.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy, did not now promise even deception.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Possibly I was mistaken, said he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"If so, I beg your pardon.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"No, you were not mistaken, she said deliberately, looking desperately into his cold face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"On reaching the house he turned his head to her, still with the same expression.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Very well!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of propriety till such time his voice shook as I may take measures to secure my honor and communicate them to you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He got out first and helped her to get out.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"Chapter 30 In the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had betaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered together, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of society went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite and unalterable place.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Just as the particle of water in frost, definitely and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of snow, so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed in his special place.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above everything, to present her daughter to this German princess, and the day after their arrival she duly performed this rite.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The German princess said, I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face, and for the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once laid down from which there was no departing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But yet inevitably the Shtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady, Marya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked, because she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a Moscow colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in uniform and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious, because there was no getting rid of him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When all this was so firmly established, Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the prince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She took no interest in the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh would come of them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her chief mental interest in the watering-place consisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not know.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined everything in people in the most favorable light possible, especially so in those she did not know.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And now as she made surmises as to who people were, what were their relations to one another, and what they were like, Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble characters, and found confirmation of her idea in her observations.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who had come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame Stahl, as everyone called her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Madame Stahl belonged to the highest society, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on exceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an invalid carriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But it was not so much from ill-health as from pride so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it that Madame Stahl had not made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as Kitty observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were seriously ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked after them in the most natural way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This Russian girl was not, as Kitty gathered, related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first youth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might have been taken for nineteen or for thirty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If her features were criticized separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of the sickly hue of her face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"She would have been a good figure, too, if it had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head, which was too large for her medium height.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But she was not likely to be attractive to men.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom and without fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of just what Kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of her own attractiveness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt, and so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the great attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty felt that in her, in her manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so painfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life apart from the worldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and appeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a purchaser.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the more convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied her, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And I should like you better still, if I had time, answered the eyes of the unknown girl.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the springs, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in it, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying cakes for tea for someone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the morning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and unfavorable attention.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These were a tall man with a stooping figure, and huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple, and yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly and tastelessly dressed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty had already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and touching romance about them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the princess, having ascertained from the visitors list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her fancies about these two people vanished.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not so much from what her mother told her, as from the fact that it was Konstantin s brother, this pair suddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This Levin, with his continual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible feeling of disgust.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently pursued her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried to avoid meeting him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 31 It was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the invalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Mamma, couldn t I speak to her?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Oh, if you want to so much, I ll find out about her first and make her acquaintance myself, answered her mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What do you see in her out of the way?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A companion, she must be.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If you like, I ll make acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-s ur_, added the princess, lifting her head haughtily.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Kitty did not insist.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
How wonderfully sweet she is!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"It s so funny to see your _engouements_, said the princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Mademoiselle Varenka?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"There, mamma, said Kitty; you wonder that I m enthusiastic about her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that Mademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his companion as with her other _prot g s_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make friends with Varenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to seem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of Madame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries about Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to prove that there could be no harm though little good in the acquaintance, she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he s very ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m used to looking after such invalids.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt I think Madame Stahl: I used to know her _belle-s ur_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, she s not my aunt.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I call her mamma, but I am not related to her; I was brought up by her, answered Varenka, flushing a little again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid expression of her face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such a fancy to Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, and what s this Levin going to do?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
asked the princess.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"He s going away, answered Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that her mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with Mademoiselle.... Varenka, Varenka put in smiling, that s what everyone calls me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her new friend s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay motionless in her hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The hand did not respond to her pressure, but the face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though rather mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I have long wished for this too, she said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But you are so busy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no, I m not at all busy, answered Varenka, but at that moment she had to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls, children of an invalid, ran up to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Varenka, mamma s calling!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
they cried.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
And Varenka went after them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 32 The particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka s past and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows: Madame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband out of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched by his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and enthusiastic temperament.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When, after her separation from her husband, she gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost immediately, and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility, and fearing the news would kill her, had substituted another child, a baby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg, the daughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was Varenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child, but she went on bringing her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka had not a relation of her own living.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Madame Stahl had now been living more than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving her couch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social position as a philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing but the good of her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to be.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No one knew what her faith was Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the highest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew Madame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to in her daughter s intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka s breeding and education were of the best she spoke French and English extremely well and what was of the most weight, brought a message from Madame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill health from making the acquaintance of the princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come and sing to them in the evening.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it s true, but you will give us so much pleasure, said the princess with her affected smile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed that Varenka had no inclination to sing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Varenka came, however, in the evening and brought a roll of music with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The princess had invited Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did not know, and she went directly to the piano.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She could not accompany herself, but she could sing music at sight very well.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty, who played well, accompanied her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You have an extraordinary talent, the princess said to her after Varenka had sung the first song extremely well.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and admiration.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Look, said the colonel, looking out of the window, what an audience has collected to listen to you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There actually was quite a considerable crowd under the windows.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I am very glad it gives you pleasure, Varenka answered simply.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty looked with pride at her friend.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"She was enchanted by her talent, and her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way Varenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved by their praises.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She seemed only to be asking: Am I to sing again, or is that enough?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If it had been I, thought Kitty, how proud I should have been!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
How delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But she s utterly unmoved by it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her only motive is to avoid refusing and to please mamma.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What is there in her?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What is it gives her the power to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How I should like to know it and to learn it of her!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"thought Kitty, gazing into her serene face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and Varenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well, standing erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin, dark-skinned hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The next song in the book was an Italian one.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty played the opening bars, and looked round at Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Let s skip that, said Varenka, flushing a little.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty let her eyes rest on Varenka s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Very well, the next one, she said hurriedly, turning over the pages, and at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music, no, let s have that one.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and as well as the others.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the house.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that song?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Don t tell me, she added hastily, only say if I m right.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"No, why not?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"I ll tell you simply, said Varenka, and, without waiting for a reply, she went on: Yes, it brings up memories, once painful ones.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it, and he married another girl.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He s living now not far from us, and I see him sometimes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You didn t think I had a love story too, she said, and there was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty felt must once have glowed all over her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I didn t think so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone else after knowing you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only I can t understand how he could, to please his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no, he s a very good man, and I m not unhappy; quite the contrary, I m very happy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Well, so we shan t be singing any more now, she added, turning towards the house.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How good you are!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"cried Kitty, and stopping her, she kissed her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
If I could only be even a little like you!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Why should you be like anyone?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You re nice as you are, said Varenka, smiling her gentle, weary smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I m not nice at all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let s sit down, said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Tell me, isn t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that he hasn t cared for it?...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he didn t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a dutiful son....",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"Yes, but if it hadn t been on account of his mother, if it had been his own doing?...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret, and that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her already.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted him, answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking not of her, but of Kitty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the humiliation, said Kitty, the humiliation one can never forget, can never forget, she said, remembering her look at the last ball during the pause in the music.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Where is the humiliation?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, you did nothing wrong?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Worse than wrong shameful.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty s hand.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, what is there shameful?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"You didn t tell a man, who didn t care for you, that you loved him, did you?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"No, no, there are looks, there are ways; I can t forget it, if I live a hundred years.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
I don t understand.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The whole point is whether you love him now or not, said Varenka, who called everything by its name.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I hate him; I can t forgive myself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Why, what for?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"The shame, the humiliation!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
if everyone were as sensitive as you are!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said Varenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There isn t a girl who hasn t been through the same.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And it s all so unimportant.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Why, what is important?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"said Kitty, looking into her face with inquisitive wonder.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Oh, there s so much that s important, said Varenka, smiling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, what?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Oh, so much that s more important, answered Varenka, not knowing what to say.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But at that instant they heard the princess s voice from the window.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty, it s cold!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Either get a shawl, or come indoors.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It really is time to go in!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Varenka, getting up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I have to go on to Madame Berthe s; she asked me to.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty her eyes asked her: What is it, what is this of such importance that gives you such tranquillity?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You know, tell me!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
But Varenka did not even know what Kitty s eyes were asking her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She merely thought that she had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste home in time for _maman s_ tea at twelve o clock.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She went indoors, collected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Allow me to see you home, said the colonel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
chimed in the princess.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Anyway, I ll send Parasha.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that she needed an escort.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me, she said, taking her hat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And kissing Kitty once more, without saying what was important, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm and vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with her her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and dignity so much to be envied.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 33 Kitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance, together with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a great influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to her by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common with her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she could contemplate her past calmly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was revealed to her that besides the instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there was a spiritual life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This life was disclosed in religion, but a religion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known from childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night services at the Widow s Home, where one might meet one s friends, and in learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This was a lofty, mysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and feelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was told to, which one could love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty found all this out not from words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Madame Stahl talked to Kitty as to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory of one s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight of Christ s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately talked of other things.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every word, in every heavenly as Kitty called it look, and above all in the whole story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized that something that was important, of which, till then, she had known nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl s character was, touching as was her story, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help detecting in her some traits which perplexed her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She noticed that when questioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled contemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She noticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her, Madame Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the lamp-shade and had smiled in a peculiar way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Trivial as these two observations were, they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to Madame Stahl.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But on the other hand Varenka, alone in the world, without friends or relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the past, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of which Kitty dared hardly dream.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In Varenka she realized that one has but to forget oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and noble.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And that was what Kitty longed to be.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Seeing now clearly what was _the most important_, Kitty was not satisfied with being enthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul to the new life that was opening to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From Varenka s accounts of the doings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had already constructed the plan of her own future life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She would, like Madame Stahl s niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great deal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be living, help them as far as she could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to the sick, to criminals, to the dying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The idea of reading the Gospel to criminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But all these were secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or to Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale, however, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many people ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new principles in imitation of Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the influence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for Madame Stahl, and still more for Varenka.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate Varenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of walking, of talking, of blinking her eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But later on the princess noticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament that Madame Stahl had given her a thing she had never done before; that she avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people who were under Varenka s protection, and especially one poor family, that of a sick painter, Petrov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing the part of a sister of mercy in that family.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All this was well enough, and the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov s wife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess, noticing Kitty s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of consolation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All this would have been very well, if there had been no exaggeration.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into extremes, and so indeed she told her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_, she said to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one could not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein one was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give one s cloak if one s coat were taken?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the princess disliked this exaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her daughter did not care to show her all her heart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty did in fact conceal her new views and feelings from her mother.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She concealed them not because she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply because she was her mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her mother.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How is it Anna Pavlovna s not been to see us for so long?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
the princess said one day of Madame Petrova.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve asked her, but she seems put out about something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I ve not noticed it, maman, said Kitty, flushing hotly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Is it long since you went to see them?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow, answered Kitty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, you can go, answered the princess, gazing at her daughter s embarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had changed her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the princess noticed again that Kitty reddened.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty, haven t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said the princess, when they were left alone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why has she given up sending the children and coming to see us?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she could not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty answered perfectly truly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had changed to her, but she guessed it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She guessed at something which she could not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never speak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be mistaken.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the family.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round, good-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered their secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him away from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him out-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her my Kitty, and would not go to bed without her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How nice it all was!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Then she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his long neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She recalled the efforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for him, as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to think of things to say to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She recalled the timid, softened look with which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which she had felt at it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But all that was at first.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, a few days ago, everything was suddenly spoiled.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty with affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her and on her husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause of Anna Pavlovna s coolness?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, she mused, there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna, and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day before yesterday: There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn t drink his coffee without you, though he s grown so dreadfully weak.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, perhaps, too, she didn t like it when I gave him the rug.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking me, that I felt awkward too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And then that portrait of me he did so well.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, yes, that s it!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
Kitty repeated to herself with horror.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"No, it can t be, it oughtn t to be!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He s so much to be pitied!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
she said to herself directly after.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 34 Before the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince Shtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to Russian friends to get a breath of Russian air, as he said came back to his wife and daughter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were completely opposed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The princess thought everything delightful, and in spite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad to be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not for the simple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she was affected, which did not altogether suit her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The prince, on the contrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European life, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself abroad less European than he was in reality.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his cheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"To Konstantin Levin the country was the background of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To Sergey Ivanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a valuable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its utility.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch s attitude to the peasants rather piqued Konstantin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that he knew and liked the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants, which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Konstantin Levin did not like such an attitude to the peasants.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To Konstantin the peasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in spite of all the respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he had for the peasant sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the milk of his peasant nurse still as a fellow-worker with him, while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these men, he was very often, when their common labors called for other qualities, exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of method, drunkenness, and lying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Of course, being a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them, and so too with the peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But like or dislike the people as something apart he could not, not only because he lived with the people, and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also because he regarded himself as a part of the people, did not see any special qualities or failings distinguishing himself and the people, and could not contrast himself with them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and arbitrator, and what was more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him, and for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice), he had no definite views of the people, and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew the people as the question whether he liked them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the contrary.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he knew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men generally.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself, but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But in the depths of his heart, the older he became, and the more intimately he knew his brother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good, of which he felt himself utterly devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a lack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which drives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life, and to care only for that one.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The better he knew his brother, the more he noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for the public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for the public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently took interest in them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was confirmed in this generalization by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a new machine.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother, because in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work on the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But though he was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he was doing no writing, he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him, and liked to have someone to listen to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him, especially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting dung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up anyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let them come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention, and there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I can t see where philosophy comes in, said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a tone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother s right to talk about philosophy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And that irritated Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll tell you, then, he said with heat, I imagine the mainspring of all our actions is, after all, self-interest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now in the local institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my horses carry me well enough over bad ones.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Doctors and dispensaries are no use to me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I never appeal to him, and never shall appeal to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The schools are no good to me, but positively harmful, as I told you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For me the district institutions simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three acres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts of idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no inducement.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile, self-interest did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did work for it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat; the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There self-interest did come in.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all decent people among us.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But to be a town councilor and discuss how many dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town in which I don t live to serve on a jury and try a peasant who s stolen a flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, Do you admit, prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the president and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was all to the point.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, what do you mean to say, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest, I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made raids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and freedom.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka I don t understand, and I can t do it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But tomorrow it ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m not going to be tried.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I shan t murder anybody, and I ve no need of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, I tell you what, he went on, flying off again to a subject quite beside the point, our district self-government and all the rest of it it s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground on Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in Europe, and I can t gush over these birch branches and believe in them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express his wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that point, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, but you know one really can t argue in that way, he observed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of which he was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he went on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I imagine, he said, that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on self-interest, that s a universal principle, a philosophical principle, he said, repeating the word philosophical with determination, as though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies, he thought.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Come, you d better let philosophy alone, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But that s not to the point; what is to the point is a correction I must make in your comparison.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The birches are not simply stuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one must deal carefully with them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of what s of importance and significance in their institutions, and know how to value them, that have a future before them it s only those peoples that one can truly call historical.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him, and showed him all the incorrectness of his view.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that s simply our Russian sloth and old serf-owner s ways, and I m convinced that in you it s a temporary error and will pass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Konstantin was silent.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly, or because his brother would not or could not understand him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But he did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they drove off.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 4 The personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with his brother was this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Once in a previous year he had gone to look at the mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper, he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house, and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ever since his brother s arrival, he had been in doubt whether to mow or not.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was loath to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But as he drove into the meadow, and recalled the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he would go mowing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After the irritating discussion with his brother, he pondered over this intention again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I must have physical exercise, or my temper ll certainly be ruined, he thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house, gave directions as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the largest and best of his grass lands.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring it round tomorrow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I shall maybe do some mowing myself too, he said, trying not to be embarrassed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The bailiff smiled and said: Yes, sir.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother: I fancy the fine weather will last.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Tomorrow I shall start mowing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m so fond of that form of field labor, said Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m awfully fond of it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his brother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it s very pleasant, said Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s splendid as exercise, only you ll hardly be able to stand it, said Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ve tried it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s hard work at first, but you get into it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I dare say I shall manage to keep it up.... Really!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
what an idea!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master s being such a queer fish?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I don t think so; but it s so delightful, and at the same time such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But how will you do about dining with them?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
To send you a bottle of Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he was detained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second row.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Gradually, as he rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight, some in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a long string, swinging their scythes differently.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He counted forty-two of them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow, where there had been an old dam.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin recognized some of his own men.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a coachman of Levin s, taking every row with a wide sweep.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Here, too, was Tit, Levin s preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was in front of all, and cut his wide row without bending, as though playing with the scythe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s ready, sir; it s like a razor, cuts of itself, said Tit, taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin took the scythe, and began trying it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As they finished their rows, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one after another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They all stared at him, but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a wrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out into the road and accosted him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Look ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there s no letting it go!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll try not to let it go, he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and waiting for the time to begin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Mind ee, repeated the old man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"Tit made room, and Levin started behind him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The grass was short close to the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while, and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the first moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Behind him he heard voices: It s not set right; handle s too high; see how he has to stoop to it, said one.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Press more on the heel, said another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Never mind, he ll get on all right, the old man resumed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you ll tire yourself out....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The master, sure, does his best for himself!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But see the grass missed out!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
For such work us fellows would catch it!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering, followed Tit, trying to do the best he could.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They moved a hundred paces.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest weariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be able to keep it up: he was so tired.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But at that very moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up some grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin straightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Behind him came a peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin s, and they went on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The next time it was just the same.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe, not stopping nor showing signs of weariness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin followed him, trying not to get left behind, and he found it harder and harder: the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, but at that very moment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So they mowed the first row.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And this long row seemed particularly hard work to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his scythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water, he felt very happy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body, he thought, comparing Tit s row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line, with his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly, probably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to be a long one.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind the peasants, and to do his work as well as possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He heard nothing but the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit s upright figure mowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and flower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe, and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was or whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot, moist shoulders.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops were falling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on; others just like Levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders, enjoying the pleasant coolness of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Another row, and yet another row, followed long rows and short rows, with good grass and with poor grass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin lost all sense of time, and could not have told whether it was late or early now.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A change began to come over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing, and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row was almost as smooth and well cut as Tit s. But so soon as he recollected what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly mown.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They both looked at the sun.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What are they talking about, and why doesn t he go back?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"thought Levin, not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping, and it was time for their lunch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Lunch, sir, said the old man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
Is it really time?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s right; lunch, then.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and the rain was drenching his hay.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The hay will be spoiled, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you ll rake in fine weather!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said the old man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch was only just getting up.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he had drunk his coffee, Levin rode back again to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and come down to the dining-room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 5 After lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before, but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely, and now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had only been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the first time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet turned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging one s arms in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the high, even row of grass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Behind Levin came the lad Mishka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His pretty, boyish face, with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin kept between them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his arms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor; and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when it was possible not to think what one was doing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The scythe cut of itself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
These were happy moments.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and offered Levin a drink.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What do you say to my home-brew, eh?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Good, eh?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"said he, winking.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter, with his hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the country.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe, but the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness of its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work turned out regular and well-finished of itself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
These were the most blissful moments.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had become unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or a tuft of sorrel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The old man did this easily.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When a hillock came he changed his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with the tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short strokes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe, then he looked at a quail s nest, from which the bird flew just under the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of position were difficult.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Both of them, repeating over and over again the same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin did not notice how time was passing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
If he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour and it was getting on for dinner time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As they were walking back over the cut grass, the old man called Levin s attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through the long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks of bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour rye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Look ee, the little emmets crawling!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"he said, pointing to them, and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They mowed two more rows; the old man stopped.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, master, dinner time!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
he said briskly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"And on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their pile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The peasants gathered into groups those further away under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The peasants got ready for dinner.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream, others made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of bread, and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old man crumbled up some bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured water on it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having seasoned it with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, master, taste my sop, said he, kneeling down before the cup.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He dined with the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking the keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt much nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the old man got up again, said his prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his head for a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that tickled his hot face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was so changed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Everything depends on their food.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk, she looked on with suspicion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It seemed to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It all seemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya Philimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more food and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the laundry maid s cow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That was clear.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"You can t understand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it s always clear whom you love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But a girl s in a position of suspense, with all a woman s or maiden s modesty, a girl who sees you men from afar, who takes everything on trust, a girl may have, and often has, such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, if the heart does not speak.... No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views about a girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, you wait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are sure you love her, you make an offer.... Well, that s not quite it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

At the time when you made Kitty an offer she was just in a position in which she could not answer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

he thought; how unnatural and false it is!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the children feel it so: Learning French and unlearning sincerity, he thought to himself, unaware that Darya Alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet, even at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to teach her children French in that way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why are you going?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Do stay a little.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished, and he felt ill at ease.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in, and, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed, with a troubled face, and tears in her eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Tanya was pulling Grisha s hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Something snapped in Darya Alexandrovna s heart when she saw this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children of hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but positively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal propensities wicked children.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak to Levin of her misery.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it showed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it, he was thinking in his heart: No, I won t be artificial and talk French with my children; but my children won t be like that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All one has to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and they ll be delightful.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 11 In the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin s sister s estate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on how things were going there and on the hay.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The chief source of income on his sister s estate was from the riverside meadows.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three acres.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Levin took over the management of the estate, he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the price at twenty-five roubles the three acres.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The peasants would not give that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut, partly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The previous year which was the third year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and that, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had divided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner s share.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone of the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay, and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother s wet-nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his bee-house, wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Parmenitch, a talkative, comely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was doing, told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year; but gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin s inquiries about the mowing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He went to the hay fields and examined the stacks.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants Levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly, to lift one stack, and carry it into the barn.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There turned out to be only thirty-two loads in the stack.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of the village elder s assertions about the compressibility of hay, and its having settled down in the stacks, and his swearing that everything had been done in the fear of God, Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders, and that, therefore, he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks, reckoning them as fifty loads each.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the last of the hay had been divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the counting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a bright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To the left, carts were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one after another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hind-quarters.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What weather for haying!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What hay it ll be!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said an old man, squatting down beside Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"It s tea, not hay!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s like scattering grain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he added, pointing to the growing haycocks.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Since dinner time they ve carried a good half of it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The last, dad!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

Children indeed!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself, and bashful too, answered the old man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

It s as fragrant as tea!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he repeated, wishing to change the subject.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They were loading a haycock onto the cart not far from him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ivan Parmenov was standing on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the huge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The young wife worked easily, merrily, and dexterously.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The close-packed hay did not once break away off her fork.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"First she gathered it together, stuck the fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the white smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ivan, obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As she raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the sun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she said he laughed aloud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous, young, freshly awakened love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 12 The load was tied on.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse by the bridle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a bold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, who were forming a ring for the haymakers dance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded carts.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The peasant women, with their rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and chattering with ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One wild untrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through a verse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing in unison.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he could do nothing, and had to lie and look on and listen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the peasants, with their singing, had vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation, his physical inactivity, his alienation from this world, came over Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had tried to cheat him, those very peasants had greeted him good-humoredly, and evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him, any regret, any recollection even of having tried to deceive him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"God gave the day, God gave the strength.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the day and the strength were consecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
For whom the labor?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What would be its fruits?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
These were idle considerations beside the point.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Often Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to his young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious, pure, and socially delightful life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the people had all separated.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Those who lived near had gone home, while those who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to spend the night in the meadow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still lay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"At first there was the sound of merry talk and laughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of heart.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Before the early dawn all was hushed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

How am I to set about it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"he said to himself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in that brief night.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One was the renunciation of his old life, of his utterly useless education.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This renunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy and simple.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of this life he felt clearly, and he was convinced he would find in it the content, the peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to effect this transition from the old life to the new.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

What s that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Someone coming, he thought, catching the tinkle of bells, and lifting his head.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Forty paces from him a carriage with four horses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road on which he was walking.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The shaft-horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

She did not look out again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The sound of the carriage-springs was no longer audible, the bells could scarcely be heard.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Conscious of it, and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the position, he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage, and making an effort to master himself, took leave of her with his usual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing; he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No; you laugh, said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself, but I never could understand it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0

But here they are.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,0
"Chapter 18 They heard the sound of steps and a man s voice, then a woman s voice and laughter, and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming with excess of health, the so-called Vaska.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak, truffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one second.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He walked after Sappho into the drawing-room, and followed her about as though he were chained to her, keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She walked with smart little steps in high-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her beauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried, and the boldness of her manners.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On her head there was such a superstructure of soft, golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was exposed in front.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress, and the question involuntarily rose to the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked in front, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers, she began telling them at once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she flung back at one stroke all on one side.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And here he comes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho had invited, and whom she had forgotten, was, however, a personage of such consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the ladies rose on his entrance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The tone of her dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Liza was as soft and enervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But to Anna s taste Liza was far more attractive.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Betsy had said to Anna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when Anna saw her, she felt that this was not the truth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She really was both innocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"It is true that her tone was the same as Sappho s; that like Sappho, she had two men, one young and one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

What is there to enjoy in that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
No; do tell me how you manage never to be bored?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"she said, addressing Anna again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Tell me how you do it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I do nothing, answered Anna, blushing at these searching questions.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s the best way, Stremov put in.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stremov was a man of fifty, partly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but with a characteristic and intelligent face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Liza Merkalova was his wife s niece, and he spent all his leisure hours with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Nothing, he put in with a subtle smile, that s the very best way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I told you long ago, he said, turning to Liza Merkalova, that if you don t want to be bored, you mustn t think you re going to be bored.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to work too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"You re incorrigible, said Stremov, not looking at her, and he spoke again to Anna.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but commonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was returning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of her, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, don t go away, please don t, pleaded Liza Merkalova, hearing that Anna was going.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Stremov joined in her entreaties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s too violent a transition, he said, to go from such company to old Madame Vrede.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And besides, you will only give her a chance for talking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings of the highest and most opposite kind, he said to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This shrewd man s flattering words, the na ve, childlike affection shown her by Liza Merkalova, and all the social atmosphere she was used to, it was all so easy, and what was in store for her was so difficult, that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But remembering what was in store for her alone at home, if she did not come to some decision, remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said good-bye and went away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 19 In spite of Vronsky s apparently frivolous life in society, he was a man who hated irregularity.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being in difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he used about five times a year (more or less frequently, according to circumstances) to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This he used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen coat, and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the table moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Petritsky, who knew he was ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is something exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So indeed it seemed to Vronsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And not without inward pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to some dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult position.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he owed, he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the sake of clearness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming in before the New Year.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky copied it, dividing it into three classes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could not be a moment s delay in paying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Such debts amounted to about four thousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in Vronsky s presence.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and Yashvin had insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business, though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the swindler, and have no more words with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The second class eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses, to the purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to be quite free from anxiety.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The last class of debts to shops, to hotels, to his tailor were such as need not be considered.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So that he needed at least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he only had one thousand eight hundred.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky s income, such debts, one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His father s immense property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand, was left undivided between the brothers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At the time when the elder brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova, the daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father s estate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be sufficient for him until he married, which he probably never would do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And his brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His mother, who had her own separate property, had allowed Alexey every year twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had reserved, and Alexey had spent it all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Of late his mother, incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow, had given up sending him the money.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And in consequence of this, Vronsky, who had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand a year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found himself now in difficulties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To get out of these difficulties, he could not apply to his mother for money.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Her last letter, which he had received the day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His mother s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever to her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered, even though he felt now, vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame Karenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But it was impossible to draw back.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had only to recall his brother s wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful Varya sought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was as impossible as beating a woman, stealing, or lying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One thing only could and ought to be done, and Vronsky determined upon it without an instant s hesitation: to borrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding which presented no difficulty, to cut down his expenses generally, and to sell his race horses.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to Rolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then he sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Having finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna s, read them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the previous day, he sank into meditation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 20 Vronsky s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never doubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that circle, had never had a moment s hesitation about doing what he ought to do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These principles laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a cardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie to a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but one may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may give one and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These principles were possibly not reasonable and not good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he adhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only quite lately in regard to his relations with Anna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he loved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word, by a hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"His attitude to society, too, was clear.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everyone might know, might suspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If any did so, he was ready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the non-existent honor of the woman he loved.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From the moment that Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could that be helped?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vronsky was prepared for this at any minute.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which frightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only the day before she had told him that she was with child.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had said that, but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the same time, as he told himself so, he was afraid whether it was not wrong.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her life with mine; am I prepared for that?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"How can I take her away now, when I have no money?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Supposing I could arrange....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But how can I take her away while I m in the service?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If I say that I ought to be prepared to do it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he grew thoughtful.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life, of which none knew but he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream which he did not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His first steps in the world and in the service had been successful, but two years before he had made a great mistake.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anxious to show his independence and to advance, he had refused a post that had been offered him, hoping that this refusal would heighten his value; but it turned out that he had been too bold, and he was passed over.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And having, whether he liked or not, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he carried it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any way, and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before, when he went away to Moscow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The friend of his childhood, a man of the same set, of the same coterie, his comrade in the Corps of Pages, Serpuhovskoy, who had left school with him and had been his rival in class, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had come back a few days before from Central Asia, where he had gained two steps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Serpuhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there; Vronsky was drenching his head with water.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I was greatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I expected even more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Serpuhovskoy smiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1

"Well, I on the contrary expected less I ll own frankly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But I m glad, very glad.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Of course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the line I ve chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to be, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know, said Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success; and so the nearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No, what s wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why aren t they independent men?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an independent fortune; they ve not had a name, they ve not been close to the sun and center as we have.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They can be bought either by money or by favor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a policy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don t believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means to a government house and so much income.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And such men are more needed than ever.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his likes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the governing world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in, through his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the world in which he moved.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt envious.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Still I haven t the one thing of most importance for that, he answered; I haven t the desire for power.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I had it once, but it s gone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, that s not true, said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And that s what I wanted to see you for.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Your action was just what it should have been.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I see that, but you ought not to keep it up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I m not going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn t I protect you?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
you ve protected me often enough!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Yes, he said, smiling to him as tenderly as a woman, give me _carte blanche_, retire from the regiment, and I ll draw you upwards imperceptibly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But you must understand that I want nothing, said Vronsky, except that all should be as it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You say that all should be as it is.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But listen: we re the same age, you ve known a greater number of women perhaps than I have.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Serpohovskoy s smile and gestures told Vronsky that he mustn t be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

We re coming directly!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into the room and called them to the colonel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey would say to him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And here s my opinion for you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Women are the chief stumbling block in a man s career.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s hard to love a woman and do anything.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There s only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance that s marriage.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Serpuhovskoy, who liked similes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Wait a minute, wait a minute!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Yes, just as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your hands, when the _fardeau_ is tied on your back, and that s marriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And that s what I felt when I was married.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
My hands were suddenly set free.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Look at Mazankov, at Krupov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What women!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The firmer the woman s footing in society, the worse it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s much the same as not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms but tearing it away from someone else.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You have never loved, Vronsky said softly, looking straight before him and thinking of Anna.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Perhaps.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
But you remember what I ve said to you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And another thing, women are all more materialistic than men.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We make something immense out of love, but they are always _terre- -terre_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Directly, directly!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You give me _carte blanche!_ We ll talk about it later on; I ll look you up in Petersburg.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 22 It was six o clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and at the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to everyone, Vronsky got into Yashvin s hired fly, and told the driver to drive as quickly as possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for four.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out on the front seat, and sank into meditation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy, who had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the anticipation of the interview before him all blended into a general, joyous sense of life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I m happy, very happy!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
he said to himself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1

"The bright, cold August day, which had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating, and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everything he saw from the carriage window, everything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was as fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the carriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Get on, get on!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

There was no one in the avenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; then suddenly she stopped.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"I did not tell you yesterday, she began, breathing quickly and painfully, that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him everything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a proud and hard expression came over his face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Yes, yes, that s better, a thousand times better!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I know how painful it was, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But she was not listening to his words, she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
She could not guess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented itself to Vronsky that a duel was now inevitable.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The idea of a duel had never crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When she got her husband s letter, she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son, and to join her lover.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya s had confirmed her still more in this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She hoped that this interview would transform her position, and save her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely, passionately, without an instant s wavering: Throw up everything and come with me!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
she would give up her son and go away with him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But this news had not produced what she had expected in him; he simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was not in the least painful to me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It happened of itself, she said irritably; and see.... she pulled her husband s letter out of her glove.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"I understand, I understand, he interrupted her, taking the letter, but not reading it, and trying to soothe her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The one thing I longed for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as to devote my life to your happiness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why do you tell me that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Do you suppose I can doubt it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
If I doubted.... Who s that coming?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies walking towards them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Perhaps they know us!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"and he hurriedly turned off, drawing her after him into a side path.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Her lips were quivering.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
And he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I tell you that s not the point I can t doubt that; but see what he writes to me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Read it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She stood still again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the betrayed husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could not help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured husband s shot, after having himself fired into the air.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no determination in them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She knew that whatever he might say to her, he would not say all he thought.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And she knew that her last hope had failed her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was not what she had been reckoning on.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You see the sort of man he is, she said, with a shaking voice; he.... Forgive me, but I rejoice at it, Vronsky interrupted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot possibly remain as he supposes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why can t they?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She felt that her fate was sealed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable, he thought things could not go on as before, but he said something different.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It can t go on.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I hope that now you will leave him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I hope he was confused, and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Tomorrow.... he was beginning.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She did not let him go on.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But my child!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

You say degrading ... don t say that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
She stood still and sobbed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done something wrong.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Is not a divorce possible?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he said feebly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"She shook her head, not answering.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Couldn t you take your son, and still leave him?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Yes; but it all depends on him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now I must go to him, she said shortly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, she said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

Chapter 23 On Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of June.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was held, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in his place, putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Among these papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he did not really need these documents.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that when the time came, and when he saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Meantime, as he listened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and inoffensive air.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the members shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to call for order.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch announced in his subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the Reorganization of the Native Tribes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All attention was turned upon him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat, and not looking at his opponent, but selecting, as he always did while he was delivering his speeches, the first person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little old man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began to expound his views.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he reached the point about the fundamental and radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stremov, who was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick, began defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but Alexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his motion was carried, three new commissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg circle nothing else was talked of but this sitting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alexey Alexandrovitch s success had been even greater than he had anticipated.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not help smiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the chief secretary of his department, anxious to flatter him, informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the Commission.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch had completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him for the return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so Alexey Alexandrovitch might have known of her arrival.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But when she arrived, he did not meet her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was told that he had not yet gone out, but was busy with his secretary.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She sent word to her husband that she had come, went to her own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her things, expecting he would come to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But an hour passed; he did not come.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She went into the dining-room on the pretext of giving some directions, and spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out there; but he did not come, though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the chief secretary.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She knew that he usually went out quickly to his office, and she wanted to see him before that, so that their attitude to one another might be defined.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When she went into his study he was in official uniform, obviously ready to go out, sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows, looking dejectedly before him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She saw him before he saw her, and she saw that he was thinking of her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then his face flushed hotly a thing Anna had never seen before, and he got up quickly and went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, but above them at her forehead and hair.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He went up to her, took her by the hand, and asked her to sit down.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I am very glad you have come, he said, sitting down beside her, and obviously wishing to say something, he stuttered.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Several times he tried to begin to speak, but stopped.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of the fact that, preparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself to despise and reproach him, she did not know what to say to him, and she felt sorry for him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
And so the silence lasted for some time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"he said, and not waiting for an answer, he added: I shan t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I had thought of going to Moscow, she said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, you did quite, quite right to come, he said, and was silent again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch, she said, looking at him and not dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair, I m a guilty woman, I m a bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have come to tell you that I can change nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I have asked you no question about that, he said, all at once, resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face; that was as I had supposed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But as I told you then, and have written to you, he said in a thin, shrill voice, I repeat now, that I am not bound to know this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I ignore it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not all wives are so kind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He laid special emphasis on the word agreeable.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as my name is not disgraced.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so I simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But our relations cannot be the same as always, Anna began in a timid voice, looking at him with dismay.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill, childish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I cannot be your wife while I.... she began.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your ideas.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I have too much respect or contempt, or both ...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I respect your past and despise your present ... that I was far from the interpretation you put on my words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Anna sighed and bowed her head.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you show, he went on, getting hot, announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently you can see anything reprehensible in performing a wife s duties in relation to your husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What is it you want of me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s not much, I think.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s all I have to say to you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now it s time for me to go.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I m not dining at home.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He got up and moved towards the door.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Anna got up too.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 24 The night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and had lost all attraction for him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of the magnificent harvest, never had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year, and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The delight he had experienced in the work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants, the envy he felt of them, of their life, the desire to adopt that life, which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention, the execution of which he had thought out in detail all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it, that he could not take his former interest in it, and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The herd of improved cows such as Pava, the whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields surrounded with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily manured, the seed sown in drills, and all the rest of it it was all splendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for themselves and comrades people in sympathy with them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he saw clearly now (his work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him in this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers, in which there was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side, the natural order of things.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And in this struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side, and with no effort or even intention on the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go to the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Worst of all, the energy expended on this work was not simply wasted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could not help feeling now, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him, that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In reality, what was the struggle about?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and he could not help it, for he had only to relax his efforts, and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers wages), while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably, that is to say, as they were used to doing it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him, so as to try not to break the winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that he should attend to what he was doing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly and heedlessly, without thinking.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That summer Levin saw this at every step.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover, justifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them to, and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be splendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so much easier to mow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he was told, Don t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The ploughs were practically useless, because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the plough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses and tore up the ground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would consent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary, the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after working all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault, saying, Do what you will to me, your honor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told him, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All this happened, not because anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he knew that they liked him, thought him a simple gentleman (their highest praise); but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly, and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed to their most just claims.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw where his boat leaked, but he did not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
(Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it.),1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But now he could deceive himself no longer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The farming of the land, as he was managing it, had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him, and he could take no further interest in it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Darya Alexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to come; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who would, so she gave him to understand, accept him now.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I can t ask her to be my wife merely because she can t be the wife of the man she wanted to marry, he said to himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The thought of this made him cold and hostile to her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling of reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will only hate me all the more, as she s bound to.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Can I help showing that I know what she told me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And me to go magnanimously to forgive her, and have pity on her!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

What induced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

This was more than he could stand.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"How could a woman of any intelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating position!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle without any reply.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To write that he would go was impossible, because he could not go; to write that he could not come because something prevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He sent the saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something shameful; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate to the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his friend Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his neighborhood, and had lately written to ask him to keep a long-standing promise to stay with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district, had long tempted Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on account of his work on the estate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"If it had not been a characteristic of Levin s to put the most favorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky s character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to himself, a fool or a knave, and everything would have seemed clear.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Still less could Levin say that he was a knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an honest, good-hearted, sensible man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly, and perseveringly at his work; he was held in high honor by everyone about him, and certainly he had never consciously done, and was indeed incapable of doing, anything base.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Just now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly glad to stay with Sviazhsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone else, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on Levin, he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness, definiteness, and good courage in life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, Levin knew that at Sviazhsky s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops, laborers wages, and so on, which, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low, but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom, and it may not be of importance in England.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"This quadrangular opening, in spite of the bosom s being very white, or just because it was very white, deprived Levin of the full use of his faculties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Lands gone out of cultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the wealth of the country has decreased.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If the same thing had been done, but with care that.... And he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This did not interest Levin, but when he had finished, Levin went back to his first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion: That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit that s perfectly true, said he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I don t believe it, Sviazhsky replied quite seriously; all I see is that we don t know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We have no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don t even know how to keep accounts.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ask any landowner; he won t be able to tell you what crop s profitable, and what s not.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Why do they spoil things?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"A wretched Russian nag they ll ruin, but keep good dray-horses they won t ruin them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And so it is all round.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
We must raise our farming to a higher level.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I devote myself to it, and I have means, but I can do nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As to the banks, I don t know to whom they re any good.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For my part, anyway, whatever I ve spent money on in the way of husbandry, it has been a loss: stock a loss, machinery a loss.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And I m not the only one, pursued Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I mix with all the neighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, tell us how does your land do does it pay?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Levin, and at once in Sviazhsky s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of Sviazhsky s mind.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, this question on Levin s part was not quite in good faith.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She did not remember the precise sum, but it appeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a farthing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky s farming, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Possibly it does not pay, answered Sviazhsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That merely proves either that I m a bad manager, or that I ve sunk my capital for the increase of my rents.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, rent!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Rent there may be in Europe, where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words they re working it out; so there s no question of rent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How no rent?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s a law.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Then we re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply muddles us.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Will you have some junket?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He turned to his wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Extraordinarily late the raspberries are lasting this year.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off, apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don t find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all men who think independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any other person s idea, and particularly partial to his own.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He stuck to it that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority, and there is none; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What makes you think, said Levin, trying to get back to the question, that it s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we ve no power over them, answered the landowner.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How can new conditions be found?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said Sviazhsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Permanent hands, day-laborers, rammers you can t get out of those forms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And will find them, in all probability.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s just what I was meaning, answered Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why shouldn t we seek them for ourselves?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They are ready, invented.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But if they don t do for us, if they re stupid?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Excuse me....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind, went to see his guests out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 28 Levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia; that the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in which they would work, as with the peasant he had met half-way to the Sviazhskys , was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And it seemed to him that the problem could be solved, and that he ought to try and solve it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole of the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going to bed, into his host s study to get the books on the labor question that Sviazhsky had offered him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sviazhsky s study was a huge room, surrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing-table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a round table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"When Sviazhsky had finished, Levin could not help asking: Well, and what then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But there was nothing to follow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was simply interesting that it had been proved to be so and so.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But I really don t know what it is you are surprised at.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The people are at such a low stage of rational and moral development, that it s obvious they re bound to oppose everything that s strange to them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In Europe, a rational system answers because the people are educated; it follows that we must educate the people that s all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But how are we to educate the people?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and schools, and schools.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

I say socialism: worse.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Education: worse.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

They give the peasant fresh wants.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, that s a thing I ve never understood, Levin replied with heat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

said Levin with annoyance; that method of doctoring I merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby is ill because it screams.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen-roost affects the screaming.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What has to be cured is what makes him poor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, in that, at least, you re in agreement with Spencer, whom you dislike so much.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He says, too, that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing, as he says, but not of being able to read and write....

And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Did you really hear it yourself?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man s life and his thoughts.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Obviously he did not care in the least what his reasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of reasoning.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a blind alley.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That was the only thing he disliked, and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by the old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of all the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent excitement.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply for social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden from Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he guided public opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country gentleman, perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life, but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class, and that the best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation of some solution near at hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg, Levin did not fall asleep for a long while.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not one conversation with Sviazhsky, though he had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin; but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in imagination amending his own replies.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be forced on him by authority.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements, you would be quite right.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the only system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with his habits, just as on the old peasant s land half-way here.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We have gone our way the European way a long while, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but as the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our system of culture in accordance with that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Imagine, I ought to have said to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting the soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Divide it in halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will be greater, and the share of labor will be greater too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How to do this?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
that s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly it can be done.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This idea threw Levin into a great excitement.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not sleep half the night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had not intended to go away next day, but he now determined to go home early in the morning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Besides, the sister-in-law with her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Most important of all he must get back without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 29 The carrying out of Levin s plan presented many difficulties; but he struggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, though not what he desired, was enough to enable him, without self-deception, to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his plans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago, but no heed had been paid him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But as for the proposal made by Levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second ploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp Levin s proposal that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle-yard and he was in complete sympathy with the plan.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, Ivan s face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say, and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens, or ran to get water or to clear out the dung.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that a landowner s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They were firmly convinced that his real aim (whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say to them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great deal but never said what was their real object.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover (Levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to use new implements.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better, that the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give up improved methods, the advantages of which were so obvious.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in spite of all these difficulties he got his way, and by autumn the system was working, or at least so it seemed to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible, and determined to divide it up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The cattle-yard, the garden, hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to be made into separate lots.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who, Levin fancied, understood the matter better than any of them, collecting together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his own family, became a partner in the cattle-yard.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A distant part of the estate, a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was with the help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant Shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system, but these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new organization of the whole, and they completely took up Levin s time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before, and Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for wages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov s company did not plough over the ground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It is true that the peasants of the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but as rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and Ryezunov himself said to Levin, If you would take a rent for the land, it would save you trouble, and we should be more free.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover the same peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a cattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it till the winter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he might say, not to let themselves be taken in.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the gleam in Ryezunov s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if anyone were to be taken in, it would not be he, Ryezunov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in spite of all this Levin thought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"In the books on political economy in Mill, for instance, whom he studied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these laws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw just the same thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student, or they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in which Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia had nothing in common.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were universal and unvarying.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You haven t read them: they ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He knew what he wanted.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that Russia has splendid land, splendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant s on the way to Sviazhsky s, the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the European way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable, and has its roots in the national spirit.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He thought that the Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was occupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The weather had become worse than ever towards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right under his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm-tree.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of the gloominess of nature around him, he felt peculiarly eager.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I cannot quite agree with that, responded Alexey Alexandrovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately, with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He began warmly contesting the justice of this view.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a convincing reply ready.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin, One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral _disons le mot_ anti-nihilist influence.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Undoubtedly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides, said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile, we should have given elbow-room to both tendencies.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and we boldly prescribe them to our patients....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

he wound up humorously.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably connected together, said Pestsov; it is a vicious circle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education results from the absence of rights.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us, said he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You said rights, said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had finished, meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil service, of sitting in parliament....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It would be more correct to say duties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing duties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Quite so, Alexey Alexandrovitch assented.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The question, I imagine, is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I can say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is.... Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties, said Sergey Ivanovitch, while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to avoid them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Duties are bound up with rights power, money, honor; those are what women are seeking, said Pestsov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a sister s, where she might have found a woman s duties, Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 11 Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come into his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest for him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But it did not interest her at all.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She and Levin had a conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of mysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No; we only came to fetch you and thank you, she said, rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift, for coming.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What do they want to argue for?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No one ever convinces anyone, you know.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes; that s true, said Levin; it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can t make out what one s opponent wants to prove.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing at last what he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend, and, chancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He tried to say this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"She knitted her brow, trying to understand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But directly he began to illustrate his meaning, she understood at once.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to him, then one can.... She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the confused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman s duties in a family.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are and must be nurses, either relations or hired.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes; a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation, while she herself.... At the hint he understood her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, yes, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"Yes, yes, yes you re right; you re right!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid s existence and its humiliation in Kitty s heart; and loving her, he felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
A silence followed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her eyes were shining with a soft light.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ve scribbled all over the table!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Here, he said; and he wrote the initial letters, _w, y, t, m, i, c, n, b, d, t, m, n, o, t_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These letters meant, When you told me it could never be, did that mean never, or then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Once or twice she stole a look at him, as though asking him, Is it what I think?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I understand, she said, flushing a little.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What is this word?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"he said, pointing to the _n_ that stood for _never_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It means _never_, she said; but that s not true!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and stood up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was suddenly radiant: he had understood.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"It meant, Then I could not answer differently.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Only then?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Yes, her smile answered.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
And n... and now?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Well, read this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ll tell you what I should like should like so much!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"she wrote the initial letters, _i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h._ This meant, If you could forget and forgive what happened.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it, wrote the initial letters of the following phrase, I have nothing to forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"I understand, she said in a whisper.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
He sat down and wrote a long phrase.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"She understood it all, and without asking him, Is it this?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
took the chalk and at once answered.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and often looked into her eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was stupefied with happiness.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"He could not supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming with happiness, he saw all he needed to know.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he wrote three letters.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm, and herself finished and wrote the answer, Yes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You re playing _secr taire_?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said the old prince.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that she loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 14 When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness without her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as quickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of death, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be left alone, to kill time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Why is it you have never married?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but Levin saw from this secretary s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted person he was.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Then the discussion began.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said something at great length with an air of triumph; and another member, scribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And then Sviazhsky (he was there too) said something too, very handsomely and nobly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all angry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They did no harm to anyone, and were all enjoying it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the friendly, affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, did you like it?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

I never supposed it was so interesting!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Capital!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was a clever and wonderfully good-hearted man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Most delighted, he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the idea of Sviazhsky s sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate, presupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least annoy Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that the whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their bedtime.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was past one o clock.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

One s got to put up with it!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s part of our work, you see.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In a gentleman s house it s easier; but then here one makes more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a sempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler s shop.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in marriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always be happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin s idea, but by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin s surprise, the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer, though he was a Frenchman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0

"Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your wife?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Ay!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1

"From a child up.... he was beginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin s enthusiasm, just as people catch yawning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"It was the gambler Myaskin, whom he knew, coming from the club.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He walked gloomily, frowning and coughing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Poor, unlucky fellow!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"thought Levin, and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At seven o clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors, and bells ringing in some servants department, and Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 15 The streets were still empty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"In the house they were only just up, and the cook came out to go marketing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had to get through at least two hours more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had eaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his body; he moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do anything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house, if need be.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And that s not all twenty years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with the creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else evolution, natural selection, struggle for existence and that s all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But in spite of this, while he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The word _talent_, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude apart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred particularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One needs to know and love her as I have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul, Vronsky thought, though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything, he said of his own portrait of her, and he just looked and painted it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s where technique comes in.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into Mihailov.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Altogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were, hostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up coming.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous of Vronsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Not envious, let us say, since he has _talent_; but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you know they all detest a title), can, without any particular trouble, do as well, if not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And more than all, it s a question of culture, which he is without.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Vronsky s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"With his characteristic decision, without explanation or apology, he simply ceased working at painting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who wondered at his loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably tedious in an Italian town.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the everlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and the German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some change.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The summer they intended to spend on Vronsky s great family estate.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 14 Levin had been married three months.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was happy, but not at all in the way he had expected to be.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At every step he found his former dreams disappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was happy; but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At every step he experienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth, happy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that little boat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating smoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where one was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must row; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was only to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very delightful, was very difficult.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As a bachelor, when he had watched other people s married life, seen the petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And all of a sudden, instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the pettiest details, which he had so despised before, but which now, by no will of his own, had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And Levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He ought, as he conceived the position, to do his work, and to find repose from it in the happiness of love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She ought to be beloved, and nothing more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, like all men, he forgot that she too would want work.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he was surprised that she, his poetic, exquisite Kitty, could, not merely in the first weeks, but even in the first days of their married life, think, remember, and busy herself about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for visitors, about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"While they were still engaged, he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country, as though she knew of something she wanted, and could still think of something outside her love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This had jarred upon him then, and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he saw that this was essential for her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And, loving her as he did, though he did not understand the reason of them, and jeered at these domestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow; rearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors; a room for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new maid; ordered dinner of the old cook; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna, taking from her the charge of the stores.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw how the old cook smiled, admiring her, and listening to her inexperienced, impossible orders, how mournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress s new arrangements.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily sweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell him that her maid, Masha, was used to looking upon her as her young lady, and so no one obeyed her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and he thought it would have been better without this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she, who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without the possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy pounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any puddings she pleased.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Instinctively feeling the approach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin s ideal of exalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this sweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not understand, but could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once in the very early days they quarreled, so that she said he did not care for her, that he cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and wrung her arms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This first quarrel arose from Levin s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He drove home thinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own happiness, and the nearer he drew to home, the warmer was his tenderness for her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He ran into the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys house to make his offer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"You ve been enjoying yourself, she began, trying to be calm and spiteful.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But as soon as she opened her mouth, a stream of reproach, of senseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window, burst from her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"It was only then, for the first time, that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt now that he was not simply close to her, but that he did not know where he ended and she began.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was offended for the first instant, but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her, that she was himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt for the first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received a violent blow from behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge himself, to look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry with, and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity, but this first time he could not for a long while get over it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His natural feeling urged him to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
One habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Another feeling, even stronger, impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched, but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Like a man half-awake in an agony of pain, he wanted to tear out, to fling away the aching place, and coming to his senses, he felt that the aching place was himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it, and this he tried to do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They made peace.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"She, recognizing that she was wrong, though she did not say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced new, redoubled happiness in their love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and trivial grounds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When one was in a good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken; but when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Altogether their honeymoon that is to say, the month after their wedding from which from tradition Levin expected so much, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period, when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite themselves.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in Russia.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon Russia, especially facilities of communication, as railways, leading to centralization in towns, the development of luxury, and the consequent development of manufactures, credit and its accompaniment of speculation all to the detriment of agriculture.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture, when it had come under regular, or at least definite, conditions; that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally, and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land, railways, called into being by political and not by economic needs, were premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected of them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress; and that just as the one-sided and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development, so in the general development of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of communication, manufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe, where they had arisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm, by throwing into the background the chief question calling for settlement the question of the organization of agriculture.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a bedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a body.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"In spite of his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as he would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch holes, but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect: he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his intellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 21 From the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her with his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not know himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs, he met everything with unqualified assent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was only when Anna had left his house, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position, and was appalled by it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already; that state was painful, but he could understand it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"For the first two days after his wife s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary, drove to the committee, and went down to dinner in the dining-room as usual.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But on the second day after her departure, when Korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper s shop, which Anna had forgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in that case he could have tried to be better), but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that for this, for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to do this for two days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"In all Petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling, who would feel for him, not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as a suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He made the offer, and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a straightforward, intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and Alexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was a believer, who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But Lidia Ivanovna s help was none the less real; she gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him, and still more, as it was soothing to her to believe, in that she almost turned him to Christianity that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of late in Petersburg.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Alexey Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and others who shared their views, was completely devoid of vividness of imagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions, and with actual fact.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing for unbelievers, did not exist for him, and that, as he was possessed of the most perfect faith, of the measure of which he was himself the judge, therefore there was no sin in his soul, and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he knew that when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power, he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness, he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that Christ was in his heart, and that in signing official papers he was doing His will.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary, from which, looked down upon by all, he could look down on others, that he clung, as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Analyzing her feeling, and comparing it with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the Tsar, that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if there had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for himself, for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet to her high notes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his character, and his soft white hands with their swollen veins.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You know papa s received the Alexander Nevsky?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the Alexander Nevsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And higher still?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And higher than the Andrey?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What, you don t know?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"and Seryozha, leaning on his elbows, sank into deep meditation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He imagined his father s having suddenly been presented with both the Vladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson, and dreamed how, when he was grown up, he would himself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than the Andrey.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Directly any higher order were invented, he would win it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They would make a higher one still, and he would immediately win that too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This touched Seryozha.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson; however much he tried, he was utterly unable to do that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As long as the teacher was explaining to him, he believed him and seemed to comprehend, but as soon as he was left alone, he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he asked all, of a sudden.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
You d much better be thinking about your work.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Birthdays are of no importance to a rational being.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s a day like any other on which one has to do one s work.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his scanty beard, at his spectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose, and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He knew that the teacher did not think what he said; he felt it from the tone in which it was said.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why does he keep me off; why doesn t he love me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Chapter 27 After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father s lesson.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"While waiting for his father, Seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife, and fell to dreaming.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Among Seryozha s favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not believe in death generally, and in her death in particular, in spite of what Lidia Ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed, and it was just because of that, and after he had been told she was dead, that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Every woman of full, graceful figure with dark hair was his mother.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him, and tears came into his eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"And he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him, would lift her veil.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All her face would be visible, she would smile, she would hug him, he would sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and cry with happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered fingers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which he could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he had watched with a throbbing heart, believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared somewhere.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"That day, more intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of love for her, and now, waiting for his father, he forgot everything, and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife, staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Here is your papa!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father, and kissing his hand, looked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the Alexander Nevsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Did you have a nice walk?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sitting down in his easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him and opening it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history thoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson, and Seryozha observed this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa, said Seryozha, sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I saw Nadinka (Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna s who was being brought up in her house).,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She told me you d been given a new star.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Are you glad, papa?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"First of all, don t rock your chair, please, said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And secondly, it s not the reward that s precious, but the work itself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And I could have wished you understood that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If you now are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work will seem hard to you; but when you work (Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he spoke, thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers), loving your work, you will find your reward in it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seryozha s eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness, grew dull and dropped before his father s gaze.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This was the same long-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His father always talked to him so Seryozha felt as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly unlike himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the story-book boy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You understand that, I hope?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said his father.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"Yes, papa, answered Seryozha, acting the part of the imaginary boy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the Gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding, bony knobbiness of his father s forehead, that he lost the thread, and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying, and that irritated him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember, because he understood it too well, just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father, and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said, as he sometimes did.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now understood nothing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But his father did not make him repeat it, and passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough, but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had already been punished over this lesson.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair, was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the Flood.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had been taken up alive to heaven.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Last time he had remembered their names, but now he had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch s translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought, in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father s watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned button on his waistcoat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved entirely.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all that he himself would die.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had been told that all men die; he had asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed it; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But Enoch had not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And why cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
thought Seryozha.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they might die, but the good might all be like Enoch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Enoch, Enos But you have said that already.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This is bad, Seryozha, very bad.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If you don t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a Christian, said his father, getting up, whatever can interest you?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch (this was the most important of his teachers) is displeased with you....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I shall have to punish you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But still it could not be said he was a stupid boy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In his father s opinion, he did not want to learn what he was taught.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In reality he could not learn that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could not, because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Those claims were in opposition, and he was in direct conflict with his education.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was nine years old; he was a child; but he knew his own soul, it was precious to him, he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he let no one into his soul.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he learned from Kapitonitch, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but not from his teachers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its waters did their work in another channel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him how to make windmills.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Of his mother Seryozha did not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly remembered her, and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"If the world disapproves, I don t care, said Vronsky; but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have to be on the same terms with my wife.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a certain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they talked about Anna s going to Vronsky s estate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of the new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange misapprehension.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned days, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the views of society had changed, and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one s legs crossed in the same position, if one knows that there s nothing to prevent one s changing one s position; but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps come on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And Anna?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Where are you stopping?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How about the divorce?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Is that all over?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
Vronsky noticed that Betsy s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Sorry we shan t see each other again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
From Betsy s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world; but he made another effort in his own family.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His mother he did not reckon upon.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that his mother, who had been so enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son s career.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"You know, Alexey, she said after hearing him, how fond I am of you, and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken, because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna, she said, articulating the name Anna Arkadyevna with particular care.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Don t suppose, please, that I judge her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Never; perhaps in her place I should have done the same.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I don t and can t enter into that, she said, glancing timidly at his gloomy face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Alexey!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
don t be angry with me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"You will understand that for me, too, it cannot be otherwise.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And with that he left her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town, avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
One of the most unpleasant features of his position in Petersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually, as though on purpose, grazing his sore finger on everything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in Anna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

To write and so enter into relations with her husband that it made her miserable to think of doing; she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To get a glimpse of her son out walking, finding out where and when he went out, was not enough for her; she had so looked forward to this meeting, she had so much she must say to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Are you really going to the theater?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"she said, wounded again at his not looking at her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She appeared not to understand the motive of his words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Oh, of course, there s no reason whatever, he said, frowning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s just what I say, she said, willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone, and quietly turning back her long, perfumed glove.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Anna, for God s sake!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
what is the matter with you?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"he said, appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He looked at her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"Chapter 33 Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna, almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If he had told her directly what he was thinking, he would have said: In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to society, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He could not say that to her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But how can she fail to see it, and what is going on in her?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"From every point of view stupid, stupid!...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And why is she putting me in such a position?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"That s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress coat out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"There was no need of speech, yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

So you re not tired?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Lean more on me, said he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You ve noticed?...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m very anxious for it, she went on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I don t know what to think, Levin answered, smiling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey seems very strange to me in that way.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I told you, you know....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died.... That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and tradition.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I remember him then.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was wonderfully sweet.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But I ve watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes, but one feels that to him they re simply people, not women.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but now with Varenka ...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I fancy there s something.... Perhaps there is....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But one has to know him....,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He s a peculiar, wonderful person.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
He lives a spiritual life only.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He s too pure, too exalted a nature.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Would this lower him, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, but he s so used to a spiritual life that he can t reconcile himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He knew that his wife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand what he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, but there s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I can see that he would never have cared for me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She is altogether spiritual.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people like you....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, he s very nice to me; but....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

Why not speak of him?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
I sometimes blame myself for not; it ends in one s forgetting.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

You envy him for not being able to fall in love?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And you?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile; but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of shame at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to be better she loved it in him, and so she smiled.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What are you dissatisfied with?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Kitty pursued with the same smile.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Don t you too work for others?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What about your co-operative settlement, and your work on the estate, and your book?...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now it s your fault, he said, pressing her hand that all that doesn t count.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I do it in a way halfheartedly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
If I could care for all that as I care for you!...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

It s all your doing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Before there was you and _this_ too, he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood I put all my energies into work; now I can t, and I m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I m pretending.... Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey Ivanovitch?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Would you like to do this work for the general good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing else?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Of course not, said Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But I m so happy that I don t understand anything.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So you think he ll make her an offer today?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he added after a brief silence.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"I think so, and I don t think so.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only, I m awfully anxious for it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Here, wait a minute.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her, and never left off admiring her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point that, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he looked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself, and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If so, he said to himself, I ought to think it over and make up my mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show, he said, and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like a swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the children s voices were floated across to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"She had all the charm and freshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she knew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society, which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch s conception of the woman who was to share his life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No, Dolly, I m going, said Levin, jumping up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Darya Alexandrovna, who had been studying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on coming to the Levins to go over with him, at least once a day, the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had offered to take her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin s lesson, and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his duty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as she wished.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour of the lesson.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So it had been today.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I m going, Dolly, you sit still, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We ll do it all properly, like the book.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting, then we shall have to miss it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And Levin went to Grisha.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Even in the happy, well-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making herself useful.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll see to the supper, you sit still, she said, and got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, yes, most likely they ve not been able to get chickens.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If so, ours.... Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it, and Varenka vanished with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What a nice girl!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Not nice, maman; she s an exquisite girl; there s no one else like her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Yes, he s very heedless, said the princess, addressing Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that it s out of the question for her (she indicated Kitty) to stay here; that she positively must come to Moscow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where Grisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s Stiva!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin shouted from under the balcony.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We ve finished, Dolly, don t be afraid!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he got nearer to the carriage he saw beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young man in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming acquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the carriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had brought with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was rather vexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more the more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka Veslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps where the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in much excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm and gallant air, kissing Kitty s hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends, said Vassenka Veslovsky, once more shaking Levin s hand with great warmth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now looked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He looked at Dolly, and he did not like her either.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She doesn t believe in his love.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So what is she so pleased about?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Revolting!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before, and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka, with his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan Arkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected Oblonsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_ making the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were all seated, Levin turned and went out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her, saying he was wanted at the counting-house.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s all holiday for them, he thought; but these are no holiday matters, they won t wait, and there s no living without them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 7 Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna, consulting about wines for supper.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"No, Stiva doesn t drink ... Kostya, stop, what s the matter?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Please, do let s go, said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I shall be delighted, we will go.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And have you had any shooting yet this year?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him, and that was so out of keeping with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I can t answer for our finding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only we ought to start early.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Aren t you tired, Stiva?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Me tired?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ve never been tired yet.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Let s go for a walk!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Yes, really, let s not go to bed at all!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Veslovsky chimed in.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Darya Alexandrovna appealed to him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan Arkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And that was not all.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw on his wife s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them something with great animation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I can t, of course, take it upon myself to judge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What do they intend doing?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I believe they think of going to Moscow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
When are you going there?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I m spending July there.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Will you go?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go, said Dolly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And it will be better indeed without you.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To be sure, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And you, Kitty?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
Why should I go?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced round at her husband.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Veslovsky asked her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She s a very fascinating woman.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
"Yes, she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She got up and walked across to her husband.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far indeed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own fashion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to him at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting, all she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to Vassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I m going, he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable to himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won t see anything of her husband, and set off the day after, said Kitty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The motive of Kitty s words was interpreted by Levin thus: Don t separate me from _him_.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I don t care about _your_ going, but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, if you wish, we ll stay here tomorrow, Levin answered, with peculiar amiability.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin saw that look.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly breathe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How dare he look at my wife like that!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
was the feeling that boiled within him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tomorrow, then?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Do, please, let us go, said Vassenka, sitting down on a chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin s jealousy went further still.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Already he saw himself a deceived husband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about his shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next day.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But even at this point Levin could not escape another agony.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he said good-night to his hostess, Vassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew back her hand and said with a na ve bluntness, for which the old princess scolded her afterwards: We don t like that fashion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In Levin s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, how can one want to go to bed!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, after drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most charming and sentimental humor.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Look, Kitty, he said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees how exquisite!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You know, he has a splendid voice; we practiced songs together along the road.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He has brought some lovely songs with him, two new ones.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife s bedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question: Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"it all burst out, and he told her all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was humiliated himself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all the more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The expression of his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"His jaws were twitching, and his voice kept breaking.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"You must understand that I m not jealous, that s a nasty word.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"I can t say what I feel, but this is awful....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m not jealous, but I m wounded, humiliated that anybody dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Eyes like what?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so increase his suffering.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he cried, clutching at his head, you shouldn t say that!...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"If you had been attractive then.... Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Why, what can you be thinking about!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"When for me there s no one in the world, no one, no one!...",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Would you like me never to see anyone?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was angry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be forbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely such trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from the agony he was suffering.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"You must understand the horror and comedy of my position, he went on in a desperate whisper; that he s in my house, that he s done nothing improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He thinks it s the best possible form, and so I m obliged to be civil to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, Kostya, you re exaggerating, said Kitty, at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his jealousy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The most awful part of it all is that you re just as you always are, and especially now when to me you re something sacred, and we re so happy, so particularly happy and all of a sudden a little wretch....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I have nothing to do with him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But why should my, and your, happiness.... Do you know, I understand now what it s all come from, Kitty was beginning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, what?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin said in dismay.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Darling, forgive me!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
It s madness!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

And how could you be so distressed at such idiocy?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, I was sorry for you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
For me?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How mad I am!...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
But why make you miserable?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
It s awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s humiliating too, of course.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, then I ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him with civility, said Levin, kissing her hands.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 8 Next day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the shooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning that they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and fro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and, disapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which the sportsmen still did not come out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and jumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one ear pricked up to listen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and, moreover, to beg her for Christ s sake to be more careful.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute push against her.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to write him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him cheerfully.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Pardon, gentlemen!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"he said, running out onto the steps.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Have you put the lunch in?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why is the chestnut on the right?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, it doesn t matter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Laska, down; go and lie down!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Put it with the herd of oxen, he said to the herdsman, who was waiting for him at the steps with some question.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Excuse me, here comes another villain.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his seat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You didn t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you re detaining me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Would your honor let me make another turning?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s only three steps to add.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And we make it just fit at the same time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It will be much more convenient.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You should have listened to me, Levin answered with annoyance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now there s no setting it right.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to add three steps.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It will be much better.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But where s your staircase coming out with its three steps?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, upon my word, sir, the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It comes out right at the very spot.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It starts, so to speak, he said, with a persuasive gesture; it comes down, and comes down, and comes out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come out?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, to be sure, it ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and come out so, the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It ll reach the ceiling and the wall.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Upon my word!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Why, it ll go up, and up, and come out like this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There, do you see?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"As your honor likes, said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his eyes, obviously understanding the thing at last.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It seems it ll be best to make a new one.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, then, do it as you re told, Levin shouted, seating himself in the wagonette.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Down!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Hold the dogs, Philip!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not disposed to talk.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh, whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and whether he would shoot well that day himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator not to be outdone by Oblonsky that too was a thought that crossed his brain.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vassenka Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he listened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple, good-hearted, and very good-humored.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If Levin had met him before he was married, he would have made friends with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a stylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin liked him for his good education, for speaking French and English with such an excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the Don Steppes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He kept praising him enthusiastically.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
isn t it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But his simplicity, particularly in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and the grace of his movements, was very attractive.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Either because his nature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him, anyway he liked his society.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the pocketbook there were thirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Do you know what, Levin, I ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That will be splendid.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he said, preparing to get out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ll send the coachman.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the remaining pair.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 9 Well, now what s our plan of campaign?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Tell us all about it, said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Our plan is this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now we re driving to Gvozdyov.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In Gvozdyov there s a grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s hot now, and we ll get there it s fifteen miles or so towards evening and have some evening shooting; we ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And is there nothing on the way?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Yes; but we ll reserve ourselves; besides it s hot.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There are two nice little places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they were near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only little places there would hardly be room for three to shoot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so, with some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but Stepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once detected reeds visible from the road.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Shan t we try that?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he said, pointing to the little marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, do, please!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
how delightful!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"Vassenka Veslovsky began begging, and Levin could but consent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Krak!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
Laska!...,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
The dogs came back.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There won t be room for three.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I ll stay here, said Levin, hoping they would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs, and turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come along, Levin, let s go together!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Veslovsky called.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Really, there s not room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Laska, back, Laska!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You won t want another dog, will you?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the sportsmen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They walked right across the marsh.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Except little birds and peewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh, said Levin, only it s wasting time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, no, it was jolly all the same.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Did you see us?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Vassenka Veslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How splendidly I shot this bird!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Didn t I?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Well, shall we soon be getting to the real place?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the stock of someone s gun, and there was the report of a shot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The gun did actually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the other hammer still cocked.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin s forehead.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And besides, Veslovsky was at first so na vely distressed, and then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay, that one could not but laugh with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would inevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them to pass it by.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Again, as the marsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come up, a grouse flew out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Krak found it again and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now you go and I ll stay with the horses, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman s envy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He handed the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that Levin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why don t you stop her?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She won t scare them, answered Levin, sympathizing with his bitch s pleasure and hurrying after her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in Laska s exploration.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
A little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She made one circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Come, come, Stiva!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud, began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He heard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could not explain to himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Fetch it!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had lifted his gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of splashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of Veslovsky s voice, shouting something with strange loudness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and got the horses stuck in the mud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Damn the fellow!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
"Levin said to himself, as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What did you drive in for?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he said to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the horses out.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But then, as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it indeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When everything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back to the road, Levin had the lunch served.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
_Bon app tit bonne conscience!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ce poulet va tomber jusqu au fond de mes bottes_, Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the French saying as he finished his second chicken.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, now our troubles are over, now everything s going to go well.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only, to atone for my sins, I m bound to sit on the box.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
I ll be your Automedon.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You shall see how I ll get you along, he answered, not letting go the rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman drive.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I must atone for my sins, and I m very comfortable on the box.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he drove.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the chestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 10 Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early, while it was still hot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their expedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together with a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
How shall we go?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"It s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Now, gentlemen, said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, do you see those reeds?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The marsh begins here, straight in front of us, do you see where it is greener?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that alder, and right up to the mill.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Over there, do you see, where the pools are?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s the best place.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There I once shot seventeen snipe.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then meet over there at the mill.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s wider to the right; you two go that way and I ll take the left, he said with apparent carelessness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
we ll make the bigger bag!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, come along, come along!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
Vassenka exclaimed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green, slime-covered pool.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin knew Laska s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, I won t get in your way, don t trouble about me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty s words at parting: Mind you don t shoot one another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The dogs came nearer and nearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own heel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a snipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Bang!,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
sounded almost in his ear.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen, far out of range.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Before Levin had time to look round, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some eight more rose one after another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed; he aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he missed again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky, who had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the water.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, now let us separate, said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on his left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog, he walked off in one direction.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
So it was that day.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
The snipe showed themselves in numbers.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They kept flying up from just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen s legs, and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the more he shot, the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain himself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as it were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Shots followed shots in rapid succession.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen, while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch s shots, not frequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard Krak, Krak, _apporte_!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This excited Levin still more.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Their whirring wings close to the earth, and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again before the sportsmen.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing-grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the trampled grass, in another by a path mown through it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Half of these strips had already been mown.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Hi, sportsmen!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an unharnessed cart; come and have some lunch with us!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Have a drop of wine!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he spoke.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I simply don t consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They ve all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Of course it s work.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Work in this sense, that if it were not for him and others like him, there would have been no railways.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But that s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned profession.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I do that s dishonest, I suppose?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I can t say.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let s say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here, however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus getting more than a station-master.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, quite the contrary; I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which is utterly baseless, and I fancy there s envy at the bottom of it.... No, that s unfair, said Veslovsky; how could envy come in?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There is something not nice about that sort of business.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 16 Darya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She was sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She quite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have anything to do with Vronsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"That she might be independent of the Levins in this expedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for the drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What makes you suppose that I dislike your going?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, even if I did dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You never told me that you were going for certain.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Hiring horses in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what s of more importance, they ll undertake the job and never get you there.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready for his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them together from the farm and saddle-horses not at all a smart-looking set, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a single day.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess, who was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin to make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him allow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Moreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked for the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna s pecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were taken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin s advice, started before daybreak.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant s with whom Levin had stayed on the way to Sviazhsky s, and chatting with the women about their children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the latter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o clock, went on again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At home, looking after her children, she had no time to think.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had suppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over all her life as she never had before, and from the most different points of view.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

"If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha isn t kicked by a horse, and Lily s stomach isn t upset again!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"She began thinking how she had to get a new flat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The girls are all right, she thought; but the boys?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s very well that I m teaching Grisha, but of course that s only because I am free myself now, I m not with child.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And with the help of good-natured friends I can bring them up; but if there s another baby coming?...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the thought struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that in sorrow she should bring forth children.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The birth itself, that s nothing; but the months of carrying the child that s what s so intolerable, she thought, picturing to herself her last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And she recalled the conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On being asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had answered cheerfully: I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, did you grieve very much for her?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
asked Darya Alexandrovna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why grieve?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
The old man has grandchildren enough as it is.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was only a trouble.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No working, nor nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Only a tie.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the good-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could not help recalling these words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In those cynical words there was indeed a grain of truth.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, altogether, thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her whole existence during those fifteen years of her married life, pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything, and most of all hideousness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Then the children s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them up; evil propensities (she thought of little Masha s crime among the raspberries), education, Latin it s all so incomprehensible and difficult.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And on the top of it all, the death of these children.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And there rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always tore her mother s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had died of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"And all this, what s it for?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
What is to come of it all?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That I m wasting my life, never having a moment s peace, either with child, or nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Even now, if it weren t for spending the summer at the Levins , I don t know how we should be managing to live.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much tact that we don t feel it; but it can t go on.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They ll have children, they won t be able to keep us; it s a drag on them as it is.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"How is papa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So that I can t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with the help of other people, at the cost of humiliation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, even if we suppose the greatest good luck, that the children don t die, and I bring them up somehow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
At the very best they ll simply be decent people.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s all I can hope for.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

One s whole life ruined!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

How is she to blame?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
She wants to live.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
God has put that in our hearts.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Very likely I should have done the same.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Even to this day I don t feel sure I did right in listening to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I ought then to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I might have loved and have been loved in reality.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not too late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always particularly attentive to her, of Stiva s good-hearted friend, Turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina, and was in love with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And there was someone else, a quite young man, who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her more beautiful than either of her sisters.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the most passionate and impossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna s imagination.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anna did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She is happy, she makes another person happy, and she s not broken down as I am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to every impression, thought Darya Alexandrovna, and a sly smile curved her lips, for, as she pondered on Anna s love affair, Darya Alexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love affair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man who was in love with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls to the carpet which covered the whole floor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove over to fetch Vronsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
On the day before there had been almost a quarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was the very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and so, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold expression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to her before.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with great composure, and merely asked when he would be back.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He looked intently at her, at a loss to explain this composure.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She smiled at his look.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew that it only happened when she had determined upon something without letting him know her plans.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was afraid of this; but he was so anxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, and half sincerely believed in what he longed to believe in her reasonableness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I hope you won t be dull?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I hope not, said Anna.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I got a box of books yesterday from Gautier s. No, I shan t be dull.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She s trying to take that tone, and so much the better, he thought, or else it would be the same thing over and over again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid explanation.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was the first time since the beginning of their intimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From one point of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that it was better so.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"At first there will be, as this time, something undefined kept back, and then she will get used to it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In any case I can give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence, he thought.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 26 In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty s confinement.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had spent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey Ivanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great interest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to set off to the elections.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He invited his brother, who had a vote in the Seleznevsky district, to come with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin had, moreover, to transact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the wardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for his sister, who was abroad.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow, and urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper nobleman s uniform, costing seven pounds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And that seven pounds paid for the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He went to Kashin.... Levin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and busily engaged about his sister s business, which still dragged on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The district marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and it was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the court of wardship.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was met too by difficulties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After long negotiations over the legal details, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most obliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have the signature of the president, and the president, though he had not given over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All these worrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and talking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the unpleasantness of the petitioner s position, but were powerless to assist him all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling of misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences in dreams when one tries to use physical force.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He felt this frequently as he talked to his most good-natured solicitor.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This solicitor did, it seemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him out of his difficulties.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I tell you what you might try, he said more than once; go to so-and-so and so-and-so, and the solicitor drew up a regular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered everything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he would add immediately, It ll mean some delay, anyway, but you might try it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And Levin did try, and did go.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everyone was kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the end, and again to bar the way.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What was particularly trying, was that Levin could not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest it was that his business should not be done.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That no one seemed to know; the solicitor certainly did not know.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If Levin could have understood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking office of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so vexatious and tiresome to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But with the hindrances that confronted him in his business, no one could explain why they existed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient, and if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told himself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that most likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now not to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as he could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing honest and excellent men whom he respected.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Since his marriage there had been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that had previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no importance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and tried to find some serious significance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the proposed revolution at the elections.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The marshal of the province in whose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public functions the guardianship of wards (the very department which was giving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums subscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female, male, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and finally, the district council the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was a nobleman of the old school, dissipating an immense fortune, a good-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He always took, in every question, the side of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to the spread of popular education, and he succeeded in giving a purely party character to the district council which ought by rights to be of such an immense importance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What was needed was to put in his place a fresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to frame their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not as the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract all the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of other provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of forces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might serve as a model for other provinces for all Russia.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And hence the whole question was of the greatest importance.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"It was proposed to elect as marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still, Nevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable intelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the nobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard for persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and hoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as at all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the exalted confidence of the monarch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the hall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even enthusiastically followed him and thronged round him while he put on his fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood there too in the crowd, and heard the governor say: Please tell Marya Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn t come to the Home.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And thereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and all drove off to the cathedral.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating the words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all the governor had hoped they would do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Church services always affected Levin, and as he uttered the words I kiss the cross, and glanced round at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt touched.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the second and third days there was business relating to the finances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance whatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after his own affairs, did not attend the meetings.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
On the fourth day the auditing of the marshal s accounts took place at the high table of the marshal of the province.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And then there occurred the first skirmish between the new party and the old.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The committee who had been deputed to verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their confidence, and shed tears.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and shook hands with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey Ivanovitch s party said that he had heard that the committee had not verified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the marshal of the province.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
One of the members of the committee incautiously admitted this.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then a small gentleman, very young-looking but very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to the marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of the public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of the committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then the members of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey Ivanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that they had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he developed this dilemma in detail.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman of the opposite party.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant gentleman again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The discussion lasted a long time and ended in nothing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject so long, especially as, when he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he supposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch answered: Oh, no!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He s an honest man.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But those old-fashioned methods of paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs must be broken down.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It was rather a stormy day in several districts.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the Seleznevsky district Sviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a dinner that evening.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 27 The sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the province.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of uniforms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Many had come only for that day.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Men who had not seen each other for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from abroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
There was much discussion around the governor s table under the portrait of the Tsar.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped themselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances, from the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group, and from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the farther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the other.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two classes: the old and the new.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The old were for the most part either in old uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats, or in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way with epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and short in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
To the younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there brightened up the crowd.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But the division into young and old did not correspond with the division of parties.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged to the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the contrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent partisans of the new party.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking light refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what they were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence trying to understand what was said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch was the center round which the others grouped themselves.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was listening at that moment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who belonged to their party.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Hliustov would not agree to go with his district to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to do so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin could not make out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they wanted to supersede.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch, came up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping his lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"We are placing our forces, he said, pulling out his whiskers, Sergey Ivanovitch!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky s contention.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One district s enough, and Sviazhsky s obviously of the opposition, he said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, Kostya, you here too!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I suppose you re converted, eh?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he added, turning to Levin and drawing his arm through his.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin would have been glad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was, and retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan Arkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the province should be asked to stand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
_ O sancta simplicitas!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and clearly he explained it to Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If, as at previous elections, all the districts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be elected without a ballot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That must not be.,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,1
"Now eight districts had agreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline to stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their party, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But if only one district, Sviazhsky s, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov would let himself be balloted for.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They were even, some of them, going to vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so that the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of the other side was put up, they too might give him some votes.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin understood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more questions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and they moved towards the big room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

No guarantee?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Eh, because of the charge against him?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, at this rate, they won t admit anyone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s a swindle!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The law!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he moved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying somewhere and afraid of missing something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Squeezed by the crowding noblemen, he drew near the high table where the marshal of the province, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 28 Levin was standing rather far off.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A nobleman breathing heavily and hoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking, prevented him from hearing distinctly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could only hear the soft voice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant gentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They were disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: liable to be called up for trial.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The act said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he shouted loudly: A ballot!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Put it to the vote!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
No need for more talking!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But it was impossible to make out what he said.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but it was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other side.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that the marshal of the province had to call for order.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Votes, please!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Beastly!...,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They expressed the most implacable hatred.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Levin did not in the least understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov should be put to the vote.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a majority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov s right to vote; that to secure the recognition of Flerov s right to vote they must decide on the interpretation to be put on the act.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life, concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Seeing the waiters busy over washing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and wine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an unexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room into the fresh air.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He began walking up and down, looking with pleasure at the waiters.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the secretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it was to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic, drew him away.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, he said, your brother s looking for you.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They are voting on the legal point.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin advanced, but utterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned to Sergey Ivanovitch with the question, Where am I to put it?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He asked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so that he had hoped his question would not be overheard.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But the persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That is a matter for each man s own decision, he said severely.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Several people smiled.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under the cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more overcome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
A hundred and twenty-six for admission!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Ninety-eight against!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"sang out the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had conquered.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin heard that they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of noblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin went nearer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Several times he repeated the words: I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you, and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the room.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice being done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of the position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies, his emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin felt a tenderness for Snetkov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Beg pardon, excuse me, please, he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It seemed to Levin that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This expression in the marshal s face was particularly touching to Levin, because, only the day before, he had been at his house about his trustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted, fatherly man.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The big house with the old family furniture; the rather dirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house serfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a cap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her daughter s daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy, coming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand; the genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the day before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something pleasant to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So you re sure to be our marshal again, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s not likely, said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I m worn out, I m old.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If there are men younger and more deserving than I, let them serve.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The most solemn moment was at hand.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

So there ll be no one to keep it up.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And yet one does it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0

I d cut down the lot.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And with what he made he d increase his stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants, Levin added, smiling.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And he d make his fortune.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Yes, Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it s rather strange, he went on.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So we live without making anything, as though we were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that s settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But why is it we don t do like the merchants?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why don t we cut down our parks for timber?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Levin, returning to a thought that had struck him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Besides that s not work for a nobleman.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Sees it all so clearly.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Vronsky assented indifferently.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A silence followed, during which Vronsky since he had to look at something looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his face, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to say something: How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a justice of the peace?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You are not in the uniform of one.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"I can t stand any more of it, said one red-faced gentleman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 31 The newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that day with Vronsky.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the country and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to repay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he had taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in order strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner which he had taken upon himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had not in the least expected that the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that he would be so good at this kind of thing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was quite a new man in the circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was unmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already obtained a certain influence.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This influence was due to his wealth and reputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend Shirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director of a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought from the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a schoolfellow of Vronsky s a schoolfellow he had patronized and protected indeed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But what contributed more than all to his success was his direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the majority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed haughtiness.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical gentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _ propos de bottes_ poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such spiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had become his adherent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw clearly, and other people recognized it, too, that he had done a great deal to secure the success of Nevyedovsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And now at his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky s election, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the success of his candidate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The election itself had so fascinated him that, if he could succeed in getting married during the next three years, he began to think of standing himself much as after winning a race ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Vronsky sat at the head of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general of high rank.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who had solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a feeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to Vronsky he was little Katka Maslov that had been his nickname in the Pages Corps whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre son aise_.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and malignant face.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and that everyone was pleased.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The episode of the elections served as a good occasion for a capital dinner.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sviazhsky comically imitated the tearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky, that his excellency would have to select another more complicated method of auditing the accounts than tears.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky: our marshal, and your excellency.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called Madame and her husband s name.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely indifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that he was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to betray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 32 Before Vronsky s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that the scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home, might only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and resolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the parting with composure.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the cold, severe glance with which he had looked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her, and before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"It is true there was still one means; not to keep him for that she wanted nothing more than his love but to be nearer to him, to be in such a position that he would not leave her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And besides, he complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that consequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their interest for him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Before her father, who purposely began talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was perfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary, exactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that, to do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and smile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence she seemed to feel about her at that instant.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the elections, which he called our parliament.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
(She had to smile to show she saw the joke.),1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya Borissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up to go; then she looked at him, but evidently only because it would be uncivil not to look at a man when he is saying good-bye.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their meeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the visit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She was pleased with herself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"She had not expected she would have had the power, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the memories of her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be perfectly indifferent and composed with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met Vronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna s. It was very hard for her to tell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the meeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a frown.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and in spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning her, which was all she wanted.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When he had heard everything, even to the detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but that afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with any chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was glad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly as possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Beauty (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country) has been badly shod and is quite lame, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What does your honor wish to be done?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own horses brought up from the country.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had tried to arrange this part of their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it appeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they still hired too.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

And for Katerina Alexandrovna?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
asked Kouzma.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to get from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful horses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles through the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours, paying five roubles every time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Now it seemed quite natural.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster, said he.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin settled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much personal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called a sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"On the way he thought no more of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the Petersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him about his book.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck by the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive but inevitable, that was expected of him on every side.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But by now he had grown used to it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That had happened to him in this matter which is said to happen to drunkards the first glass sticks in the throat, the second flies down like a hawk, but after the third they re like tiny little birds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to pay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help reflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone but they were indubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and Kitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries, that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is, would pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash Wednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late evening and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But the next note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations, that cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the reflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which men would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and winnowed and sifted and sown, this next one he parted with more easily.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and they flew off like little birds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Whether the labor devoted to obtaining the money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with it, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His business calculation that there was a certain price below which he could not sell certain grain was forgotten too.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The rye, for the price of which he had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure cheaper than it had been fetching a month ago.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Only one thing was essential: to have money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to know that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 3 Levin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at the university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his marriage.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his conception of life.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov s conception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov thought that the disconnectedness of Levin s ideas was due to his lack of intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov s clearness, and Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin s untrained ideas, and they liked to meet and to discuss.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

This was Metrov.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The conversation touched for a brief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the higher spheres in Petersburg.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Metrov repeated a saying that had reached him through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered on this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both sayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic dropped.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, here he s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the laborer in relation to the land, said Katavasov; I m not a specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the contrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that dependence seeking the laws of his development.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s very interesting, said Metrov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer, said Levin, reddening, I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian laborer?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Metrov; in his biological characteristics, so to speak, or in the condition in which he is placed?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he did not agree.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian laborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of other people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that in his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the consciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the East.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the general vocation of a people, said Metrov, interrupting Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land and to capital.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began expounding to him the special point of his own theory.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because he did not take the trouble to understand.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that Metrov, like other people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the current theory of political economy, looked at the position of the Russian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and rent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the eastern much the larger part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took the form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does not so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yet it was only from that point of view that he considered every laborer, though in many points he differed from the economists and had his own theory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He would have liked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his opinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov s theories superfluous.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the matter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he did not even oppose his statements, but simply listened.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Although what Metrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet experienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It flattered his vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so eagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin s understanding of the subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect of the subject.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He put this down to his own credit, unaware that Metrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with all his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every new person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject that interested him, even if still obscure to himself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Three old professors in the council had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The young ones had registered a separate resolution.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The meeting had already begun.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Round the cloth-covered table, at which Katavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading something aloud.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said: Biography.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help listening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of the distinguished man of science.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some verses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words by way of thanks to the poet.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice read his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was being kept.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past one, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to read Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
During the reading he had thought over their conversation.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw distinctly now that though Metrov s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas had a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to something if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that nothing would be gained by putting their ideas together.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And having made up his mind to refuse Metrov s invitation, Levin went up to him at the end of the meeting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with whom he was talking of the political news.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Metrov told the chairman what he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his news that he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety he expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
After that the conversation turned again on the university question.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As Levin had already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was sorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and drove to Lvov s. Chapter 4 Lvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty s sister, had spent all his life in foreign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"During the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing to any unpleasantness (he never had any unpleasantness with anyone), and was transferred to the department of the court of the palace in Moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the fact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one another that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He got up and pushed up a rocking chair.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

To Lvov it was very interesting.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting scientific circles, he said.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And as he talked, he passed as usual into French, which was easier to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
It s true I haven t the time for it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I m not ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That I don t believe, said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always did, touched at Lvov s low opinion of himself, which was not in the least put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely sincere.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, yes, indeed!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
I feel now how badly educated I am.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To educate my children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply to study myself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Oh, you re laughing at it!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"On the contrary, you can t imagine how, when I look at you, I m always learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one s children.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, there s nothing for you to learn, said Lvov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"If you look for perfection, you will never be satisfied.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to their father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov s colleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court uniform, to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up without a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town council, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Chapter 5 At the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were performed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette dedicated to the memory of Bach.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Both were new and in the new style, and Levin was eager to form an opinion of them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After escorting his sister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to listen as attentively and conscientiously as possible.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He tried not to let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or talkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before him, listening.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he felt from forming any definite opinion of it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There was, as it were, a continual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some feeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new musical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer, exceedingly complex but disconnected sounds.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And these fragmentary musical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable, because they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one another without any connection, like the emotions of a madman.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And those emotions, like a madman s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching people dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the fantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain on his attention.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Loud applause resounded on all sides.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everyone got up, moved about, and began talking.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Anxious to throw some light on his own perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk about, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known musical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"How are you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia s approach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with fate.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin asked timidly, forgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Cordelia comes in ... see here!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Pestsov, tapping his finger on the satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste to read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were printed on the back of the program.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You can t follow it without that, said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as the person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to talk to.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In the _entr acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the merits and defects of music of the Wagner school.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Levin maintained that the mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take music into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it tries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an instance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble certain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the pedestal.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they were positively clinging on the ladder, said Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The comparison pleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same phrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest manifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Pestsov, who was standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time, condemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of simplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites in painting.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with whom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Among others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Well, go at once then, Madame Lvova said, when he told her; perhaps they ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch me.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Countess Bola pretended to be listening.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He must stay two minutes longer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He sat down.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not find a subject for conversation, and sat silent.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You are not going to the public meeting?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"They say it will be very interesting, began the countess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But, probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made a blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled several times with vexation.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner who had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to punish him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day before in conversation from an acquaintance.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Without allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it would end, judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these ordeals, Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to keep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to him he could do this.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Once he had been sent to move a table and sofa.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had done this eagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he found it was his own bed he had been getting ready.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened nearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed of his brother Nikolay.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But that had been grief this was joy.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"Yet that grief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of life; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through which there came glimpses of something sublime.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"he repeated to himself incessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete alienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and simply as he had in his childhood and first youth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
All this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One was away from her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after another and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with Dolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner, about politics, about Marya Petrovna s illness, and where Levin suddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he had waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow, where his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from sympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And every time he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching him from the bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had come upon him the first minute.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But as he looked at her, he saw again that help was impossible, and he was filled with terror and prayed: Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And as time went on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he became away from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing became both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but seeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words, I am worrying you, he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell to beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 15 He did not know whether it was late or early.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The candles had all burned out.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the doctor that he should lie down.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He had completely forgotten what was going on now.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Suddenly there came an unearthly shriek.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

"The doctor put his head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as strange.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I suppose it must be so, he thought, and still sat where he was.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Whose scream was this?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he had no wish to see or comprehend.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta Petrovna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Remembering that she had meant to go on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter and asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Count Vronsky?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute, to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And what is the coachman like?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a letter.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I am very sorry your note did not reach me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

she said to herself with an evil smile.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"Very good, you can go home then, she said softly, addressing Mihail.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart s beating hindered her breathing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I won t let you make me miserable, she thought menacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made her suffer, and she walked along the platform.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1

"Some ladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles, paused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she reached them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

A luggage train was coming in.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The platform began to sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"With a rapid, light step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails and stopped quite near the approaching train.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains and the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up, and trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and the very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"There, she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage, at the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers there, in the very middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from myself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"A feeling such as she had known when about to take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed herself.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole series of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that had covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before her for an instant with all its bright past joys.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But she did not take her eyes from the wheels of the second carriage.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And at the same instant she was terror-stricken at what she was doing.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Where am I?,1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
What am I doing?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1

PART EIGHT Chapter 1 Almost two months had passed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The hot summer was half over, but Sergey Ivanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch s life had not been uneventful during this time.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"A year ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years labor, Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe and Russia.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Several sections of this book and its introduction had appeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by Sergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas of the work could not be completely novel to the public.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But still Sergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be sure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a revolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been published, and had been distributed among the booksellers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned indifference answered his friends inquiries as to how the book was going, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was selling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained attention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the world and in literature.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression whatever could be detected.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His friends who were specialists and savants, occasionally unmistakably from politeness alluded to it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The rest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned subject, did not talk of it at all.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And society generally just now especially absorbed in other things was absolutely indifferent.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the press, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for writing a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was silence.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Only in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer Drabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to Koznishev s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen through by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious review.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He had met him once at Golubtsov s. The author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a writer, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal relations.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete respect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The article was awful.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which could not possibly be put on it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had selected quotations so adroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously scarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole book was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even as suggested by marks of interrogation used appropriately, and that the author of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the subject.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would not have disowned such wit himself.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But that was just what was so awful.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
"In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey Ivanovitch verified the correctness of the critic s arguments, he did not for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were ridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall every detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the article.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Didn t I offend him in some way?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,1
Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about something he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found the clue to explain the article.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in the press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six years task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no trace.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch s position was still more difficult from the fact that, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary work to do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and he did not know what use to make of his energy.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Conversations in drawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees everywhere where talk was possible took up part of his time.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But being used for years to town life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less experienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had a great deal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the failure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting sects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions, and of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the Slavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested society, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise this subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked of or written about just now but the Servian War.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of the Slavonic States.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies dresses, beer, restaurants everything testified to sympathy with the Slavonic peoples.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey Ivanovitch differed on various points.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He saw that the Slavonic question had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed one another in providing society with an object and an occupation.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from motives of self-interest and self-advertisement.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He recognized that the newspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated, with the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most forward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were smarting under a sense of injury generals without armies, ministers not in the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without followers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous and absurd.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing enthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to sympathize.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the same Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against the oppressors.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And the heroism of the Servians and Montenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a longing to help their brothers not in word but in deed.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That was the manifestation of public opinion.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The public had definitely expressed its desire.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch said, found expression.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"And the more he worked in this cause, the more incontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume vast dimensions, to create an epoch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause, and forgot to think about his book.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"His whole time now was engrossed by it, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and appeals addressed to him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He worked the whole spring and part of the summer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his brother s in the country.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the people, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of that uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all residents in the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with Levin, and so he was going with him.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Chapter 2 Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of the Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that day, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their things, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ladies met them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd they went into the station.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and addressed Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You too come to see them off?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I m going away myself, princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
To my brother s for a holiday.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Do you always see them off?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly perceptible smile.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, that would be impossible!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,0,0
answered the princess.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
Is it true that eight hundred have been sent from us already?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Malvinsky wouldn t believe me.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
More than eight hundred.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"If you reckon those who have been sent not directly from Moscow, over a thousand, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
That s just what I said!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
exclaimed the lady.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
"And it s true too, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What do you say to today s telegram?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Beaten the Turks again.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Yes, so I saw, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They were speaking of the last telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in succession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a decisive engagement was expected.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and they ve made some difficulty, I don t know why.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
I meant to ask you; I know him; please write a note about his case.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He s being sent by Countess Lidia Ivanovna.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the young man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to the person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and handed it to the princess.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

He s here: there s only his mother seeing him off.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It s the best thing, anyway, that he could do.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, yes, of course.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,1
While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the dining-room.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass in his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In the service of religion, humanity, and our brothers, the gentleman said, his voice growing louder and louder; to this great cause mother Moscow dedicates you with her blessing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"_Jivio!_ he concluded, loudly and tearfully.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Everyone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall, almost carrying the princess off her legs.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Ah, princess!",1,Anna Karenina,1,1,1,1
that was something like!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,1,0
"said Stepan Arkadyevitch, suddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them with a delighted smile.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Capitally, warmly said, wasn t it?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And Sergey Ivanovitch!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Why, you ought to have said something just a few words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well, he added with a soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch forward a little by the arm.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"No, I m just off.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To the country, to my brother s, answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"And Princess Myakaya not Liza, but Bibish is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Did I tell you?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

There s a fine fellow for you!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Eh, princess?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
he turned to the lady.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
The princess looked at Koznishev without replying.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But the fact that Sergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did not in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Smiling, he stared at the feather in the princess s hat, and then about him as though he were going to pick something up.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Fine chaps those Montenegrins!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he cried, when the princess told him that Vronsky was going by this train.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch s face looked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his mustaches and swinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky was, he had completely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister s corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"With all his faults one can t refuse to do him justice, said the princess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What a typically Russian, Slav nature!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Again the volunteers bowed and poked their heads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He had had so much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and did not interest him.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented his having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much interested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Chapter 8 Ever since, by his beloved brother s deathbed, Levin had first glanced into the questions of life and death in the light of these new convictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his twentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish and youthful beliefs he had been stricken with horror, not so much of death, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how, and what it was.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The physical organization, its decay, the indestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy, evolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many scientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the questions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply ignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no possible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the materialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced that he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and re-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation of life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"As long as he followed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit, will, freedom, essence,_ purposely letting himself go into the snare of words the philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend something.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But he had only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from life itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with the fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces at once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had been built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in life more important than reason.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works of Homiakov.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of divine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of men bound together by love to the church.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"What delighted him was the thought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living church, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head, and therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in God, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God, a mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But afterwards, on reading a Catholic writer s history of the church, and then a Greek orthodox writer s history of the church, and seeing that the two churches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority of the other, Homiakov s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for him, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers edifices.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of horror.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself by any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on the contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the general welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the mass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had completely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself with all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what he was doing that he could not do otherwise.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"In former days almost from childhood, and increasingly up to full manhood when he had tried to do anything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the whole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant, but the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never had a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that had begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it vanished into nothing.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"But now, since his marriage, when he had begun to confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he experienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing, he felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded far better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"When he did not think, but simply lived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge in his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was the better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act rightly, he was at once aware of it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he was and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge to such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying down his own individual definite path in life.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Chapter 11 The day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of Levin s most painful days.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It was the very busiest working time, when all the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in labor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and would be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities themselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every year, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows, turn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn all this seems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Are volunteers still going out then?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You should have seen what was going on at the station yesterday!,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"With the Turks, Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he extricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it with the knife on a stout aspen leaf.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But the prince is not speaking of help, said Levin, coming to the assistance of his father-in-law, but of war.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"Well now, well, what s your own theory?",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Katavasov said to Levin with a smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Why have not private persons the right to do so?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Oh, my theory s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars; that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this, and is driven inevitably into war.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the public asserts its will, said Katavasov.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
His brows contracted at Katavasov s words and he said something else.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
You don t put the matter in its true light.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

There are traditions still extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the yoke of the unclean sons of Hagar.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

The priest had been told to read that.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
He read it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
They didn t understand a word of it.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"Then they were told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church; well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they couldn t say.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense finds utterance, said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at the old bee-keeper.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair, stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That s so, no doubt, he said, with a significant shake of his head at Sergey Ivanovitch s words.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

Ought we to fight for the Christians?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
What should we think?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

They bring their halfpence or go themselves and say directly what for.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"It means, to my thinking, said Levin, who was beginning to get warm, that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste, ne er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere to Pogatchev s bands, to Khiva, to Servia....",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"I tell you that it s not a case of hundreds or of ne er-do-wells, but the best representatives of the people!",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"said Sergey Ivanovitch, with as much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his fortune.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
And what of the subscriptions?,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
In this case it is a whole people directly expressing their will.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"That word people is so vague, said Levin.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

One can hear nothing for them.,1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

"He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his brother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some hundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they and the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people, and a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0
"He could not admit this, because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in the people among whom he was living, nor found them in himself (and he could not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian people), and most of all because he, like the people, did not know and could not know what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a doubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict observance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to every man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for any general objects whatever.",1,Anna Karenina,1,0,0,0

you will exclaim.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0

I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This aroused the stranger s attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the d mon, as he called him, had pursued.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"August 13th, 17 .",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My affection for my guest increases every day.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"One man s life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener s countenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: Unhappy man!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Do you share my madness?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
He asked me the history of my earlier years.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I agree with you, replied the stranger; we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You would not if you saw him.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"August 19th, 17 .",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yesterday the stranger said to me, You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I expressed these feelings in my answer.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thank you, he replied, for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I understand your feeling, continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant s house.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Several months passed in this manner.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
There was a sense of justice in my father s upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
From Italy they visited Germany and France.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I remained for several years their only child.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My mother s tender caresses and my father s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was their plaything and their idol, and something better their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For a long time I was their only care.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She appeared of a different stock.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He became the victim of its weakness.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The apparition was soon explained.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They were fond of the sweet orphan.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents house my more than sister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Everyone loved Elizabeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, I have a pretty present for my Victor tomorrow he shall have it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 2 We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers she found ample scope for admiration and delight.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
And Clerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, Ah!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Cornelius Agrippa!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The most learned philosopher knew little more.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child s blindness, added to a student s thirst for knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher s stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nor were these my only visions.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 3 When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My children, she said, my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Alas!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
The day of my departure at length arrived.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Clerval spent the last evening with us.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We sat late.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word Farewell!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning s dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure I was now alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were old familiar faces, but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chance or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father s door led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The professor stared.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Have you, he said, really spent your time in studying such nonsense?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I replied in the affirmative.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Every minute, continued M. Krempe with warmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This professor was very unlike his colleague.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: The ancient teachers of this science, said he, promised impossibilities and performed nothing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Such were the professor s words rather let me say such the words of the fate enounced to destroy me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I closed not my eyes that night.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By degrees, after the morning s dawn, sleep came.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I awoke, and my yesternight s thoughts were as a dream.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He said that These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am happy, said M. Waldman, to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 4 From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In M. Waldman I found a true friend.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knew well therefore what would be my father s feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, C sar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always yielded me supreme delight so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 5 It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Beautiful!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Great God!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch the miserable monster whom I had created.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Oh!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I passed the night wretchedly.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
[Coleridge s Ancient Mariner. ],3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he, how glad I am to see you!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You may easily believe, said he, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But, my dear Frankenstein, continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My dear Victor, cried he, what, for God s sake, is the matter?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do not laugh in that manner.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How ill you are!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
What is the cause of all this?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Do not ask me, cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; _he_ can tell.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, save me!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Save me!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Poor Clerval!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
What must have been his feelings?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During all that time Henry was my only nurse.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I afterwards learned that, knowing my father s advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, how kind, how very good you are to me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How shall I ever repay you?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I trembled.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
One subject!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
What could it be?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Compose yourself, said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Is that all, my dear Henry?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 6 Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was from my own Elizabeth: My dearest Cousin, You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You are forbidden to write to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Get well and return to us.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
"You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Your father s health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The blue lake and snow-clad mountains they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she looked so frank-hearted and happy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Poor girl!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Nor was her residence at her mother s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Write, dearest Victor, one line one word will be a blessing to us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Adieu!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat you, write!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Elizabeth Lavenza.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Geneva, March 18th, 17 .",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Dear, dear Elizabeth!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What could I do?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"He meant to please, and he tormented me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
D n the fellow!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"cried he; why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ay, ay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Excellent friend!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 7 On my return, I found the following letter from my father: My dear Victor, You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
William is dead!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Victor, he is murdered!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was not there.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder s finger was on his neck.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She was very earnest to see the corpse.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, O God!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I have murdered my darling child!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Your dear mother!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Alas, Victor!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1

"I can offer you no consolation, my friend, said he; your disaster is irreparable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What do you intend to do?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0

Poor William!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
To die so miserably; to feel the murderer s grasp!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Poor little fellow!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My journey was very melancholy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How altered every thing might be during that time!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
"One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I wept like a child.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Dear mountains!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
my own beautiful lake!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
how do you welcome your wanderer?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was echoed from Sal ve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop t. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the M le, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, William, dear angel!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"this is thy funeral, this thy dirge!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy d mon, to whom I had given life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What did he there?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
_He_ was the murderer!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could not doubt it.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal ve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I remained motionless.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The gates were open, and I hastened to my father s house.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And then of what use would be pursuit?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Sal ve?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was about five in the morning when I entered my father s house.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Beloved and venerable parent!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
He still remained to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was an historical subject, painted at my father s desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: Welcome, my dearest Victor, said he.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Ah!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
he was our darling and our pride!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother s eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She most of all, said Ernest, requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But since the murderer has been discovered The murderer discovered!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
how can that be?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
who could attempt to pursue him?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I saw him too; he was free last night!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not know what you mean, replied my brother, in accents of wonder, but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Justine Moritz!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At that instant my father entered.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, Good God, papa!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We do also, unfortunately, replied my father, for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This speech calmed me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
We were soon joined by Elizabeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She welcomed me with the greatest affection.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Your arrival, my dear cousin, said she, fills me with hope.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She is innocent, my Elizabeth, said I, and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How kind and generous you are!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She wept.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"Dearest niece, said my father, dry your tears.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 8 We passed a few sad hours until eleven o clock, when the trial was to commence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The appearance of Justine was calm.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She returned to the house about eight o clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Justine was called on for her defence.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"God knows, she said, how entirely I am innocent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Ch ne, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On her return, at about nine o clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Concerning the picture she could give no account.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I know, continued the unhappy victim, how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But here also I am checked.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Did the murderer place it there?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am, said she, the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am well acquainted with the accused.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my uncle s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth s simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I believed in her innocence; I knew it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Could the d mon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That evidence, he observed, was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Had my eyes deceived me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My cousin, replied I, it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But she has confessed.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine s innocence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
said she.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yes, said Elizabeth, I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My cousin wept also.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Oh, Justine!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Why did you rob me of my last consolation?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Her voice was suffocated with sobs.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth; why do you kneel, if you are innocent?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did confess, but I confessed a lie.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The God of heaven forgive me!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"She paused, weeping, and then continued, I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Dear William!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
dearest blessed child!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Why did you confess?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But do not mourn, dear girl.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Do not fear.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You shall not die!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Justine shook her head mournfully.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not fear to die, she said; that pang is past.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Despair!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Who dared talk of that?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Justine started.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could not answer.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"No, Justine, said Elizabeth; he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I truly thank him.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She indeed gained the resignation she desired.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wish, cried she, that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Live, and be happy, and make others so.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And on the morrow Justine died.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Elizabeth s heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This also was my doing!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"And my father s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,0
"Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 9 Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do you think, Victor, said he, that I do not suffer also?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No one could love a child more than I loved your brother tears came into his eyes as he spoke but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This change was particularly agreeable to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was now free.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
But that could not be.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Remorse extinguished every hope.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Our house was the house of mourning.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father s health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other s blood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet I am certainly unjust.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But she was innocent.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing what can disturb our peace?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I passed the bridge of P lissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its tremendous _d me_ overlooked the valley.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Then again the kindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 10 I spent the following day roaming through the valley.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillised it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What were rain and storm to me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It is a scene terrifically desolate.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
We rise; one wand ring thought pollutes the day.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, The path of its departure still is free.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Man s yesterday may ne er be like his morrow; Nought may endure but mutability!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
that it was the wretch whom I had created.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Devil, I exclaimed, do you dare approach me?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Begone, vile insect!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And, oh!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I expected this reception, said the d mon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You purpose to kill me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
How dare you sport thus with life?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Abhorred monster!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Fiend that thou art!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Wretched devil!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"He easily eluded me and said, Be calm!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Begone!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I will not hear you.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How can I move thee?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They spurn and hate me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I will keep no terms with my enemies.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But hear me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Why do you call to my remembrance, I rejoined, circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
You have made me wretched beyond expression.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Thus I relieve thee, my creator, he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These motives urged me to comply with his demand.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 11 It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Finding the door open, I entered.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pand monium appeared to the d mons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How miraculous did this appear!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She followed, and they disappeared.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
The meal was quickly dispatched.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 12 I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I thought of the occurrences of the day.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They were not entirely happy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What did their tears imply?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Did they really express pain?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and _wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or _Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good, dearest, unhappy._ I spent the winter in this manner.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was not thus with Felix.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I thought (foolish wretch!),3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Happy, happy earth!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 13 I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son s sorrow.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"She did not appear to understand him, but smiled.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man s feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, Good night sweet Safie.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney s _Ruins of Empires_.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans of their subsequent degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The words induced me to turn towards myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And what was I?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Of what a strange nature is knowledge!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state which I feared yet did not understand.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Miserable, unhappy wretch!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But where were my friends and relations?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What was I?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 14 Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The name of the old man was De Lacey.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was tried and condemned to death.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This idea was torture to him.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He did not succeed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter s apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She fell, however, into good hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 15 Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It impressed me deeply.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarch s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my annihilation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What did this mean?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Who was I?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Whence did I come?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
What was my destination?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The volume of _Plutarch s Lives_ which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This book had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I learned from Werter s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You doubtless recollect these papers.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Here they are.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,0
"Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I sickened as I read.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Hateful day when I received life!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I exclaimed in agony.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Accursed creator!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I remembered Adam s supplication to his Creator.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But where was mine?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Autumn passed thus.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realise my fears.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I knocked.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who is there?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
said the old man.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Come in.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I entered.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Pardon this intrusion, said I; I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Enter, said De Lacey, and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I sat down, and a silence ensued.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Are they Germans?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"No, they are French.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
But let us change the subject.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do not despair.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Where do these friends reside?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Near this spot.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The old man paused and then continued, If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Excellent man!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I thank you and accept your generous offer.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Heaven forbid!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
May I know the names and residence of those friends?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I paused.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, Now is the time!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Save and protect me!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
You and your family are the friends whom I seek.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
exclaimed the old man.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Who are you?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Chapter 16 Cursed, cursed creator!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why did I live?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What a miserable night I passed!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had certainly acted imprudently.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father s feet.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
All there was at peace.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do you consider, said his companion to him, that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is utterly useless, replied Felix; we can never again inhabit your cottage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I entreat you not to reason with me any more.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Felix trembled violently as he said this.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"As night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At length the thought of you crossed my mind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But how was I to direct myself?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Unfeeling, heartless creator!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, earth!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This was then the reward of my benevolence!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, Child, what is the meaning of this?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
He struggled violently.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Let me go, he cried; monster!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Ugly wretch!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You are an ogre.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Let me go, or I will tell my papa.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Hideous monster!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Let me go.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
My papa is a syndic he is M. Frankenstein he will punish you.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
You dare not keep me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Frankenstein!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"And then I bent over her and whispered, Awake, fairest, thy lover is near he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She moved again, and I fled.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This being you must create.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 17 The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"He continued, You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do refuse it, I replied; and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You are in the wrong, replied the fiend; and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am malicious because I am miserable.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Shall I respect man when he condemns me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded I intended to reason.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature s sake I would make peace with the whole kind!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was moved.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"He saw my change of feeling and continued, If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You propose, replied I, to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How inconstant are your feelings!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His words had a strange effect upon me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You swear, I said, to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How is this?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Turning to him, therefore, I said, I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I swear, he cried, by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, Oh!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations they weighed on me with a mountain s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I felt as if I were placed under a ban as if I had no right to claim their sympathies as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 18 Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear father, reassure yourself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father s house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
These feelings dictated my answer to my father.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father s age rendered him extremely averse to delay.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman s sedulous attention.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He came.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This is what it is to live, he cried; now I enjoy existence!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Clerval!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Beloved friend!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was a being formed in the very poetry of nature.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to him An appetite; a feeling, and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrow d from the eye.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
[Wordsworth s Tintern Abbey .],3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And where does he now exist?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Does it now only exist in my memory?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I will proceed with my tale.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
"Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich places which I had heard of even in my country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 19 London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He was for ever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
From thence we proceeded to Oxford.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was formed for peaceful happiness.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could pass my life here, said he to me; and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But he found that a traveller s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For my own part I was not sorry.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d mon s disappointment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur s Seat, St. Bernard s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew s, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do you, said I, enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He entreated me to write often.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had rather be with you, he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This I hired.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Chapter 20 I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the d mon at the casement.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0

"I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And then I thought again of his words _I will be with you on your wedding-night._ That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d mon.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Fiend, I exclaimed, your task is already fulfilled!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Fortunately I had money with me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My good friends, said I, will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You will know that soon enough, replied a man with a hoarse voice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why do you answer me so roughly?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I replied.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,1
Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not know, said the man, what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin s to give an account of yourself.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who is Mr. Kirwin?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why am I to give an account of myself?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Is not this a free country?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 21 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The son confirmed his father s account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A fever succeeded to this.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why did I not die?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Are you better now, sir?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"However, that s none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Your family is perfectly well, said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, Oh!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Take him away!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"I cannot see him; for God s sake, do not let him enter!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
My father!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Is my father indeed come?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How kind, how very kind!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I stretched out my hand to him and cried, Are you then safe and Elizabeth and Ernest?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And poor Clerval The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Yes, my father, replied I; some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The image of Clerval was for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
"Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The season of the assizes approached.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck the shadow of a human being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My strength was gone.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It was midnight.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend s grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 22 The voyage came to an end.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"We landed, and proceeded to Paris.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father s care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He wished me to seek amusement in society.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I abhorred the face of man.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, not abhorred!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father, said I, how little do you know me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this I murdered her.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"William, Justine, and Henry they all died by my hands.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my convalescence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am not mad, I cried energetically; the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth: My dear Friend, It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Explanation!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Tell me, dearest Victor.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth Do you not love another?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But this is false reasoning.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Geneva, May 18th, 17 This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend _I will be with you on your wedding-night!_ Such was my sentence, and on that night would the d mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What freedom?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet I would die to make her happy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father s happiness, my adversary s designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My letter was calm and affectionate.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I fear, my beloved girl, I said, little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth s letter we returned to Geneva.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I saw a change in her also.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
She wept with me and for me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I remained silent.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"Have you, then, some other attachment?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
None on earth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My dear Victor, do not speak thus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Such were the lessons of my father.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words _I shall be with you on your wedding-night_, I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Through my father s exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father was in the meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Sal ve, the pleasant banks of Montal gre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I took the hand of Elizabeth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You are sorrowful, my love.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Be happy, my dear Victor, replied Elizabeth; there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What a divine day!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
How happy and serene all nature appears!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Chapter 23 It was eight o clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What is it you fear?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Peace, peace, my love, replied I; this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Why did I not then expire!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Everywhere I turn I see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Could I behold this and live?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The murderous mark of the fiend s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Tears streamed from my eyes.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
"Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I arrived at Geneva.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What then became of me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause the monster whom I had created, the miserable d mon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Be assured, sir, said he, no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thank you, replied I; listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"When I had concluded my narration, I said, This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He, however, answered mildly, I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You are mistaken, said he.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Man, I cried, how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Cease; you know not what it is you say.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Chapter 24 My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d mon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,0
"The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, I am satisfied, miserable wretch!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d mon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
O blessed sleep!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What agonising fondness did I feel for them!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the d mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My reign is not yet over these words were legible in one of these inscriptions you live, and my power is complete.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Scoffing devil!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
One inscription that he left was in these words: Prepare!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary s gibe, to meet and grapple with him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day s journey in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the d mon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I pressed on, but in vain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But your direction was northwards.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d mon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No; I am not so selfish.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I will hover near and direct the steel aright.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Walton, _in continuation._ August 26th, 17 .",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Such a monster has, then, really existence!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Are you mad, my friend?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,0
said he.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Since you have preserved my narration, said he, I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, no!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When younger, said he, I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Must I then lose this admirable being?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathise with and love me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I thank you, Walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0

"We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This speech troubled me.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Turning towards the men, he said, What do you mean?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
What do you demand of your captain?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Did you not call this a glorious expedition?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And wherefore was it glorious?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Be men, or be more than men.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
They looked at one another and were unable to reply.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
September 7th.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
September 12th.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It is past; I am returning to England.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They shout, I said, because they will soon return to England.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do you, then, really return?",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Do so, if you will; but I will not.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, Alas!",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Farewell, Walton!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet why do I say this?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,0
All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am interrupted.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
What do these sounds portend?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I must arise and examine.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Good night, my sister.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
what a scene has just taken place!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I called on him to stay.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
That is also my victim!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
he exclaimed.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, Frankenstein!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Generous and self-devoted being!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,1,1
"I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He is cold, he cannot answer me.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Your repentance, I said, is now superfluous.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And do you dream?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
said the d mon.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"He, he continued, pointing to the corpse, he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet when she died!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"Nay, then I was not miserable.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
"I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
Evil thenceforth became my good.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
And now it is ended; there is my last victim!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Wretch!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
I said.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Hypocritical fiend!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Oh, it is not thus not thus, interrupted the being.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,0
Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
No sympathy may I ever find.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"They were for ever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Was there no injustice in this?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
But it is true that I am a wretch.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"There he lies, white and cold in death.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
My work is nearly complete.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Neither yours nor any man s death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I shall die.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Farewell!,3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
"I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Farewell, Frankenstein!",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,1
"But soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.",3,Frankenstein,1,1,0,1
Soon these burning miseries will be extinct.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
"My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
Farewell.,3,Frankenstein,1,1,1,1
"He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.",3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.,3,Frankenstein,0,1,0,0
