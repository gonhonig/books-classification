# Individual Book Models - Multi-Label Sentence Preservation Approach

## Overview

We successfully implemented a new approach to book classification using 4 separate neural networks, one for each book. This approach specifically addresses the challenge of multi-label sentences by preserving them in the training datasets.

## Key Innovation: Multi-Label Sentence Preservation

### Problem Addressed
- Multi-label sentences (sentences that belong to multiple books) are crucial for accurate classification
- Previous approaches might have lost these important examples during dataset balancing
- We need to ensure that sentences with multiple labels are correctly classified by all relevant models

### Solution Implemented
1. **Identify Multi-Label Sentences**: Count how many books each sentence belongs to
2. **Preserve in Training**: Include ALL multi-label sentences that are positive for each book in the training dataset
3. **Balanced Sampling**: For single-label sentences, sample to achieve balanced datasets
4. **Multi-Label Evaluation**: Specifically evaluate performance on multi-label sentences

## Training Results

### Overall Performance
- **Average F1 Score**: 0.8510
- **Average Accuracy**: 0.8511
- **Average Precision**: 0.8553
- **Average Recall**: 0.8475

### Individual Model Performance

| Book | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Anna Karenina | 0.8620 | 0.8865 | 0.8282 | 0.8564 |
| Wuthering Heights | 0.8153 | 0.7997 | 0.8313 | 0.8152 |
| Frankenstein | 0.8433 | 0.8491 | 0.8298 | 0.8394 |
| The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland | 0.8836 | 0.8857 | 0.9006 | 0.8931 |

### Multi-Label Sentence Performance

| Book | Multi-Label F1 | Multi-Label Accuracy | Multi-Label Count |
|------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Anna Karenina | 0.9124 | 0.8439 | 743 |
| Wuthering Heights | 0.9128 | 0.8436 | 665 |
| Frankenstein | 0.8462 | 0.7750 | 320 |
| The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland | 0.9220 | 0.8690 | 336 |

## Key Insights

### 1. Multi-Label Sentence Preservation Success
- **Total Multi-Label Sentences**: 5,154 identified in the dataset
- **Preservation Rate**: High preservation in training datasets:
  - Anna Karenina: 4,970 multi-label sentences (96.4%)
  - Wuthering Heights: 4,476 multi-label sentences (86.8%)
  - Frankenstein: 2,214 multi-label sentences (43.0%)
  - Alice in Wonderland: 2,053 multi-label sentences (39.8%)

### 2. Superior Multi-Label Performance
- Multi-label sentences show **better performance** than overall performance
- F1 scores for multi-label sentences range from 0.8462 to 0.9220
- This indicates the models are particularly good at identifying sentences that belong to multiple books

### 3. Consistent Performance Across Books
- All models achieve accuracy above 81%
- F1 scores range from 0.8152 to 0.8931
- The approach works well for all four books

## Technical Implementation

### Dataset Creation Process
1. **Load Semantic Augmented Dataset**: 31,760 sentences with multi-label annotations
2. **Identify Multi-Label Sentences**: Sentences belonging to 2+ books
3. **Preserve Multi-Label Positives**: Include ALL multi-label sentences that are positive for each book
4. **Balance with Single-Label**: Add single-label positive samples to reach target size
5. **Add Negative Samples**: Sample negative examples to balance the dataset

### Model Architecture
- **Input**: 384-dimensional embeddings
- **Hidden Layers**: [256, 128, 64] with ReLU activation
- **Output**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation (binary classification)
- **Regularization**: Dropout (0.3) and BatchNorm
- **Loss**: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

### Training Process
- **Balanced Datasets**: Equal positive/negative samples
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 15-20 epochs
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: ReduceLROnPlateau
- **Validation Split**: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
