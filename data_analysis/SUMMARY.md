# Data Analysis Reorganization Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Created `data_analysis/` directory** - All analysis files moved to a dedicated directory
2. **Simplified analysis focus** - Removed redundant `original_label` analysis since it's equivalent to `original_book`
3. **Updated script** - Created `semantic_dataset_analysis.py` with book-focused analysis
4. **Updated documentation** - Modified README to reflect the new structure and focus
5. **Cleaned up files** - Removed old redundant files

## Current Structure

```
data_analysis/
├── semantic_dataset_analysis.py          # Main analysis script
├── SEMANTIC_DATASET_ANALYSIS_README.md  # Documentation
├── SUMMARY.md                           # This file
├── semantic_dataset_analysis_results.json # Analysis results
├── semantic_dataset_comprehensive_analysis.png # 2x2 visualization grid
└── semantic_dataset_3d_pca_detailed.png # 3D PCA plot
```

## Key Changes

### Analysis Focus
- **Before**: Analyzed both `original_label` and `original_book` (redundant)
- **After**: Focus only on `original_book` with additional multi-label count analysis

### Visualizations
- **PCA by Original Book**: Shows clustering by source book
- **PCA by Multi-label Count**: Shows how samples with different numbers of labels cluster
- **t-SNE by Original Book**: Better separation visualization
- **t-SNE by Multi-label Count**: Shows multi-label patterns

### File Organization
- All analysis files now in dedicated `data_analysis/` directory
- Script uses relative paths to access data from parent directory
- Cleaner, more organized structure

## Usage

```bash
cd data_analysis
python semantic_dataset_analysis.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner organization** - All analysis files in one place
2. **Simplified analysis** - No redundant label/book analysis
3. **Better insights** - Focus on meaningful book-based clustering
4. **Easier maintenance** - Single script to maintain
5. **Clear documentation** - Updated README explains the focus and structure
