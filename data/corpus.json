      "CHAPTER I.",
      "Down the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it,  and what is the use of a book,  thought Alice\n without pictures or conversations?",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.",
      "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,  Oh\ndear!",
      "Oh dear!",
      "I shall be late!",
      "(when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next.",
      "First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs.",
      "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled  ORANGE MARMALADE , but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.",
      "Well!",
      "thought Alice to herself,  after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!",
      "How brave they ll all think me\nat home!",
      "Why, I wouldn t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!",
      "(Which was very likely true.)",
      "Down, down, down.",
      "Would the fall _never_ come to an end?",
      "I wonder how\nmany miles I ve fallen by this time?",
      "she said aloud.",
      "I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth.",
      "Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think  (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over)  yes, that s about the right distance but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ve got to?",
      "(Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)",
      "Presently she began again.",
      "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth!",
      "How funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward!",
      "The Antipathies, I think  (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all\nthe right word)  but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know.",
      "Please, Ma am, is this New Zealand or Australia?",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy _curtseying_ as you re\nfalling through the air!",
      "Do you think you could manage it?)",
      "And what\nan ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking!",
      "No, it ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.",
      "Down, down, down.",
      "There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again.",
      "Dinah ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!",
      "(Dinah was the cat.)",
      "I hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time.",
      "Dinah my dear!",
      "I wish you were down here with me!",
      "There are\nno mice in the air, I m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s\nvery like a mouse, you know.",
      "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?",
      "And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way,  Do cats eat bats?",
      "Do cats eat bats?",
      "and\nsometimes,  Do bats eat cats?",
      "for, you see, as she couldn t answer\neither question, it didn t much matter which way she put it.",
      "She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?",
      "when suddenly,\nthump!",
      "thump!",
      "down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit.",
      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,  Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it s getting!",
      "She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas!",
      "either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them.",
      "However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",
      "How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway;  and even if my head would go through,  thought\npoor Alice,  it would be of very little use without my shoulders.",
      "Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope!",
      "I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, ( which certainly was not here\nbefore,  said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words  DRINK ME,  beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.",
      "It was all very well to say  Drink me,  but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry.",
      "No, I ll look first,  she said,\n and see whether it s marked  _poison_  or not ; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked  poison,  it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.",
      "However, this bottle was _not_ marked  poison,  so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n What a curious feeling!",
      "said Alice;  I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden.",
      "First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this;  for it might end, you know, \nsaid Alice to herself,  in my going out altogether, like a candle.",
      "I\nwonder what I should be like then?",
      "And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!",
      "when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.",
      "Come, there s no use in crying like that!",
      "said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply;  I advise you to leave off this minute!",
      "She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.",
      "But it s no use now,  thought poor Alice,  to pretend to be two\npeople!",
      "Why, there s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n EAT ME  were beautifully marked in currants.",
      "Well, I ll eat it,  said\nAlice,  and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I ll\nget into the garden, and I don t care which happens!",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,  Which way?",
      "Which\nway?",
      ", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.",
      "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.",
      "The Pool of Tears\n\n\n Curiouser and curiouser!",
      "cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English);  now I m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was!",
      "Good-bye, feet!",
      "(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off).",
      "Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?",
      "I m\nsure _I_ shan t be able!",
      "I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can; but I must be\nkind to them,  thought Alice,  or perhaps they won t walk the way I\nwant to go!",
      "Let me see: I ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.",
      "And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.",
      "They must\ngo by the carrier,  she thought;  and how funny it ll seem, sending\npresents to one s own feet!",
      "And how odd the directions will look!",
      "_Alice s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice s love_).",
      "Oh dear, what nonsense I m talking!",
      "Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.",
      "Poor Alice!",
      "It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself,  said Alice,  a great girl like\nyou,  (she might well say this),  to go on crying in this way!",
      "Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!",
      "But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
      "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",
      "It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came,  Oh!",
      "the Duchess, the\nDuchess!",
      "Oh!",
      "won t she be savage if I ve kept her waiting!",
      "Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice,  If you please,\nsir  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
      "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:  Dear, dear!",
      "How\nqueer everything is to-day!",
      "And yesterday things went on just as usual.",
      "I wonder if I ve been changed in the night?",
      "Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning?",
      "I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different.",
      "But if I m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I?",
      "Ah, _that s_ the great puzzle!",
      "And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
      "I m sure I m not Ada,  she said,  for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all; and I m sure I can t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!",
      "she knows such a\nvery little!",
      "Besides, _she s_ she, and _I m_ I, and oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is!",
      "I ll try if I know all the things I used to know.",
      "Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is oh dear!",
      "I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate!",
      "However, the Multiplication Table doesn t signify: let s try\nGeography.",
      "London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome no, _that s_ all wrong, I m certain!",
      "I must have been\nchanged for Mabel!",
      "I ll try and say  _How doth the little_  and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do: \n\n How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!",
      "How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!",
      "I m sure those are not the right words,  said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on,  I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh!",
      "ever so many lessons to learn!",
      "No, I ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I m Mabel, I ll stay down here!",
      "It ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying  Come up again, dear!",
      "I shall only look up and say  Who am I then?",
      "Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I ll come up: if not, I ll stay down\nhere till I m somebody else but, oh dear!",
      "cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears,  I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!",
      "I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking.",
      "How _can_ I have done that?",
      "she thought.",
      "I must be\ngrowing small again.",
      "She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
      "That _was_ a narrow escape!",
      "said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence;  and\nnow for the garden!",
      "and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas!",
      "the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before,  and things are worse than\never,  thought the poor child,  for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never!",
      "And I declare it s too bad, that it is!",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash!",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water.",
      "Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea,  and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,  she said to herself.",
      "(Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)",
      "However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.",
      "I wish I hadn t cried so much!",
      "said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out.",
      "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears!",
      "That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure!",
      "However, everything is queer to-day.",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.",
      "Would it be of any use, now,  thought Alice,  to speak to this mouse?",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there s no harm in trying.",
      "So she\nbegan:  O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?",
      "I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother s Latin Grammar,  A mouse of\na mouse to a mouse a mouse O mouse! )",
      "The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.",
      "Perhaps it doesn t understand English,  thought Alice;  I daresay it s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.",
      "(For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.)",
      "So she began again:  O  est ma chatte?",
      "which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book.",
      "The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright.",
      "Oh, I beg your pardon!",
      "cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal s feelings.",
      "I quite forgot you didn t like\ncats.",
      "Not like cats!",
      "cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.",
      "Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?",
      "Well, perhaps not,  said Alice in a soothing tone:  don t be angry\nabout it.",
      "And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her.",
      "She is such a dear\nquiet thing,  Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool,  and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh, I beg your\npardon!",
      "cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended.",
      "We won t talk\nabout her any more if you d rather not.",
      "We indeed!",
      "cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail.",
      "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject!",
      "Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!",
      "Don t let me hear the name\nagain!",
      "I won t indeed!",
      "said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation.",
      "Are you are you fond of of dogs?",
      "The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly:  There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you!",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair!",
      "And it ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things I can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it s so useful, it s worth a hundred pounds!",
      "He says\nit kills all the rats and oh dear!",
      "cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n I m afraid I ve offended it again!",
      "For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.",
      "So she called softly after it,  Mouse dear!",
      "Do come back again, and we\nwon t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don t like them!",
      "When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice,  Let us get to the shore, and then I ll tell you my\nhistory, and you ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
      "Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
      "CHAPTER III.",
      "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life.",
      "Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say,  I am\nolder than you, and must know better;  and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out,  Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!",
      "_I ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!",
      "They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle.",
      "Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",
      "Ahem!",
      "said the Mouse with an important air,  are you all ready?",

      "Found _it_,  the Mouse replied rather crossly:  of course you know\nwhat  it  means.",
      "I know what  it  means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,  said the\nDuck:  it s generally a frog or a worm.",
      "The question is, what did the\narchbishop find?",

      "it continued,\nturning to Alice as it spoke.",
      "As wet as ever,  said Alice in a melancholy tone:  it doesn t seem to\ndry me at all.",
      "In that case,  said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet,  I move\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\nremedies \n\n Speak English!",
      "said the Eaglet.",
      "I don t know the meaning of half\nthose long words, and, what s more, I don t believe you do either!",
      "And\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\ntittered audibly.",
      "What I was going to say,  said the Dodo in an offended tone,  was,\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.",
      "What _is_ a Caucus-race?",
      "said Alice; not that she wanted much to\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
      "Why,  said the Dodo,  the best way to explain it is to do it.",
      "(And,\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ( the exact\nshape doesn t matter,  it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there.",
      "There was no  One, two, three, and\naway,  but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.",
      "However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out  The race is over!",
      "and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking,  But who has won?",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",
      "At last the Dodo\nsaid,  _Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.",
      "But who is to give the prizes?",
      "quite a chorus of voices asked.",
      "Why, _she_, of course,  said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way,  Prizes!",
      "Prizes!",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes.",
      "There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.",
      "But she must have a prize herself, you know,  said the Mouse.",
      "Of course,  the Dodo replied very gravely.",
      "What else have you got in\nyour pocket?",
      "he went on, turning to Alice.",
      "Only a thimble,  said Alice sadly.",
      "Hand it over here,  said the Dodo.",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\npresented the thimble, saying  We beg your acceptance of this elegant\nthimble;  and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\ncheered.",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\nshe could.",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
      "You promised to tell me your history, you know,  said Alice,  and why\nit is you hate C and D,  she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\nwould be offended again.",
      "Mine is a long and a sad tale!",
      "said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\nsighing.",
      "It _is_ a long tail, certainly,  said Alice, looking down with wonder\nat the Mouse s tail;  but why do you call it sad?",
      "And she kept on\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\ntale was something like this: \n\n          Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house,  Let us both\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.",
      "Come, I ll take no\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I ve\n         nothing to do.",
      "Said the mouse to the cur,  Such a trial, dear\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.",
      "I ll be judge, I ll be jury,  Said cunning old Fury:  I ll\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.",
      "You are not attending!",
      "said the Mouse to Alice severely.",
      "What are\nyou thinking of?",
      "I beg your pardon,  said Alice very humbly:  you had got to the fifth\nbend, I think?",
      "I had _not!_  cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
      "A knot!",
      "said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\nanxiously about her.",
      "Oh, do let me help to undo it!",
      "I shall do nothing of the sort,  said the Mouse, getting up and\nwalking away.",
      "You insult me by talking such nonsense!",
      "I didn t mean it!",
      "pleaded poor Alice.",
      "But you re so easily offended,\nyou know!",
      "The Mouse only growled in reply.",
      "Please come back and finish your story!",
      "Alice called after it; and\nthe others all joined in chorus,  Yes, please do!",
      "but the Mouse only\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
      "What a pity it wouldn t stay!",
      "sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\nher daughter  Ah, my dear!",
      "Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\n_your_ temper!",
      "Hold your tongue, Ma!",
      "said the young Crab, a little\nsnappishly.",
      "You re enough to try the patience of an oyster!",
      "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!",
      "said Alice aloud,\naddressing nobody in particular.",
      "She d soon fetch it back!",
      "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?",
      "said the\nLory.",
      "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\n Dinah s our cat.",
      "And she s such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan t think!",
      "And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!",
      "Why,\nshe ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!",
      "This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.",
      "Some of the\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\ncarefully, remarking,  I really must be getting home; the night-air\ndoesn t suit my throat!",
      "and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\nto its children,  Come away, my dears!",
      "It s high time you were all in\nbed!",
      "On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.",
      "I wish I hadn t mentioned Dinah!",
      "she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone.",
      "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I m sure she s the best\ncat in the world!",
      "Oh, my dear Dinah!",
      "I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!",
      "And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited.",
      "In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.",
      "CHAPTER IV.",
      "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\n\n\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\nit muttering to itself  The Duchess!",
      "The Duchess!",
      "Oh my dear paws!",
      "Oh\nmy fur and whiskers!",
      "She ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\nferrets!",
      "Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?",
      "Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\nthey were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\nlittle door, had vanished completely.",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone,  Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here?",
      "Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan!",
      "Quick, now!",
      "And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.",
      "He took me for his housemaid,  she said to herself as she ran.",
      "How\nsurprised he ll be when he finds out who I am!",
      "But I d better take him\nhis fan and gloves that is, if I can find them.",
      "As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name  W. RABBIT,  engraved upon it.",
      "She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.",
      "How queer it seems,  Alice said to herself,  to be going messages for\na rabbit!",
      "I suppose Dinah ll be sending me on messages next!",
      "And she\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen:  Miss Alice!",
      "Come\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!",
      "Coming in a minute,\nnurse!",
      "But I ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out.",
      "Only I\ndon t think,  Alice went on,  that they d let Dinah stop in the house\nif it began ordering people about like that!",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass.",
      "There was no label\nthis time with the words  DRINK ME,  but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips.",
      "I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,  she said to herself,  whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI ll just see what this bottle does.",
      "I do hope it ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",
      "She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself  That s quite enough I hope I shan t\ngrow any more As it is, I can t get out at the door I do wish I hadn t\ndrunk quite so much!",
      "Alas!",
      "it was too late to wish that!",
      "She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself  Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens.",
      "What _will_ become of me?",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
      "It was much pleasanter at home,  thought poor Alice,  when one wasn t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits.",
      "I almost wish I hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole and yet and\nyet it s rather curious, you know, this sort of life!",
      "I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me!",
      "When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none!",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!",
      "And\nwhen I grow up, I ll write one but I m grown up now,  she added in a\nsorrowful tone;  at least there s no room to grow up any more _here_.",
      "But then,  thought Alice,  shall I _never_ get any older than I am\nnow?",
      "That ll be a comfort, one way never to be an old woman but\nthen always to have lessons to learn!",
      "Oh, I shouldn t like _that!_ \n\n Oh, you foolish Alice!",
      "she answered herself.",
      "How can you learn\nlessons in here?",
      "Why, there s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\nfor any lesson-books!",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
      "Mary Ann!",
      "Mary Ann!",
      "said the voice.",
      "Fetch me my gloves this moment!",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.",
      "Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice s elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure.",
      "Alice heard it say to itself  Then I ll\ngo round and get in at the window.",
      "_That_ you won t!",
      "thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air.",
      "She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",
      "Next came an angry voice the Rabbit s Pat!",
      "Pat!",
      "Where are you?",
      "And\nthen a voice she had never heard before,  Sure then I m here!",
      "Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!",
      "Digging for apples, indeed!",
      "said the Rabbit angrily.",
      "Here!",
      "Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_  (Sounds of more broken glass.)",
      "Now tell me, Pat, what s that in the window?",
      "Sure, it s an arm, yer honour!",
      "(He pronounced it  arrum. )",
      "An arm, you goose!",
      "Who ever saw one that size?",
      "Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!",
      "Sure, it does, yer honour: but it s an arm for all that.",
      "Well, it s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\nnow and then; such as,  Sure, I don t like it, yer honour, at all, at\nall!",
      "Do as I tell you, you coward!",
      "and at last she spread out her\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air.",
      "This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.",
      "What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "I wonder what\nthey ll do next!",
      "As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\n_could!_ I m sure _I_ don t want to stay in here any longer!",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\ntalking together: she made out the words:  Where s the other\nladder?",
      "Why, I hadn t to bring but one; Bill s got the other Bill!",
      "fetch it here, lad!",
      "Here, put  em up at this corner No, tie  em\ntogether first they don t reach half high enough yet Oh!",
      "they ll do\nwell enough; don t be particular Here, Bill!",
      "catch hold of this\nrope Will the roof bear?",
      "Mind that loose slate Oh, it s coming down!",
      "Heads below!",
      "(a loud crash) Now, who did that?",
      "It was Bill, I\nfancy Who s to go down the chimney?",
      "Nay, _I_ shan t!",
      "_You_ do\nit!",
      "_That_ I won t, then!",
      "Bill s to go down Here, Bill!",
      "the master says\nyou re to go down the chimney!",
      "Oh!",
      "So Bill s got to come down the chimney, has he?",
      "said Alice to\nherself.",
      "Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!",
      "I wouldn t be in\nBill s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn t guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself  This is Bill,  she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next.",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of  There goes Bill!",
      "then the Rabbit s voice along Catch him, you by the hedge!",
      "then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices Hold up his head Brandy\nnow Don t choke him How was it, old fellow?",
      "What happened to you?",
      "Tell\nus all about it!",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ( That s Bill,  thought\nAlice,)  Well, I hardly know No more, thank ye; I m better now but I m\na deal too flustered to tell you all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!",
      "So you did, old fellow!",
      "said the others.",
      "We must burn the house down!",
      "said the Rabbit s voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could,  If you do, I ll set Dinah at you!",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself,  I\nwonder what they _will_ do next!",
      "If they had any sense, they d take the\nroof off.",
      "After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say,  A barrowful will do, to begin with.",
      "A barrowful of _what?_  thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face.",
      "I ll put a stop to\nthis,  she said to herself, and shouted out,  You d better not do that\nagain!",
      "which produced another dead silence.",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead.",
      "If I eat one of these cakes,  she thought,  it s sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can t possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly.",
      "As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside.",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle.",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.",
      "The first thing I ve got to do,  said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood,  is to grow to my right size again; and the\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.",
      "I think that\nwill be the best plan.",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\ngreat hurry.",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.",
      "Poor little\nthing!",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\nspite of all her coaxing.",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\nand till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
      "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!",
      "said Alice, as she leant\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\nleaves:  I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if if I d\nonly been the right size to do it!",
      "Oh dear!",
      "I d nearly forgotten that\nI ve got to grow up again!",
      "Let me see how _is_ it to be managed?",
      "I\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\nquestion is, what?",
      "The great question certainly was, what?",
      "Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\nanything else.",
      "CHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
      "Who are _you?_  said the Caterpillar.",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.",
      "Alice replied,\nrather shyly,  I I hardly know, sir, just at present at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.",
      "What do you mean by that?",
      "said the Caterpillar sternly.",
      "Explain\nyourself!",
      "I can t explain _myself_, I m afraid, sir,  said Alice,  because I m\nnot myself, you see.",
      "I don t see,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "I m afraid I can t put it more clearly,  Alice replied very politely,\n for I can t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.",
      "It isn t,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, perhaps you haven t found it so yet,  said Alice;  but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis you will some day, you know and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you ll feel it a little\nqueer, won t you?",
      "Not a bit,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,  said Alice;  all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.",
      "You!",
      "said the Caterpillar contemptuously.",
      "Who are _you?_ \n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar s making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely,  I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.",
      "Why?",
      "said the Caterpillar.",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.",
      "Come back!",
      "the Caterpillar called after her.",
      "I ve something\nimportant to say!",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.",
      "Keep your temper,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Is that all?",
      "said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.",
      "No,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",
      "For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,  So you\nthink you re changed, do you?",
      "I m afraid I am, sir,  said Alice;  I can t remember things as I\nused and I don t keep the same size for ten minutes together!",
      "Can t remember _what_ things?",
      "said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, I ve tried to say  How doth the little busy bee,  but it all\ncame different!",
      "Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
      "Repeat,  _You are old, Father William_,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice folded her hands, and began: \n\n You are old, Father William,  the young man said,\n     And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head \n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?",
      "In my youth,  Father William replied to his son,\n     I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I m perfectly sure I have none,\n    Why, I do it again and again.",
      "You are old,  said the youth,  as I mentioned before,\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door \n    Pray, what is the reason of that?",
      "In my youth,  said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n     I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment one shilling the box \n    Allow me to sell you a couple?",
      "You are old,  said the youth,  and your jaws are too weak\n    For anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak \n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?",
      "In my youth,  said his father,  I took to the law,\n    And argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.",
      "You are old,  said the youth,  one would hardly suppose\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose \n    What made you so awfully clever?",
      "I have answered three questions, and that is enough, \n    Said his father;  don t give yourself airs!",
      "Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?",
      "Be off, or I ll kick you down stairs!",
      "That is not said right,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Not _quite_ right, I m afraid,  said Alice, timidly;  some of the\nwords have got altered.",
      "It is wrong from beginning to end,  said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.",
      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
      "What size do you want to be?",
      "it asked.",
      "Oh, I m not particular as to size,  Alice hastily replied;  only one\ndoesn t like changing so often, you know.",
      "I _don t_ know,  said the Caterpillar.",
      "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
      "Are you content now?",
      "said the Caterpillar.",
      "Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn t\nmind,  said Alice:  three inches is such a wretched height to be.",
      "It is a very good height indeed!",
      "said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
      "But I m not used to it!",
      "pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",
      "And she\nthought of herself,  I wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily\noffended!",
      "You ll get used to it in time,  said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.",
      "In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself.",
      "Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.",
      "One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_  thought Alice to\nherself.",
      "Of the mushroom,  said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.",
      "However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.",
      "And now which is which?",
      "she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit.",
      "Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.",
      "*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n Come, my head s free at last!",
      "said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
      "What _can_ all that green stuff be?",
      "said Alice.",
      "And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to?",
      "And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can t see you?",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.",
      "She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
      "Serpent!",
      "screamed the Pigeon.",
      "I m _not_ a serpent!",
      "said Alice indignantly.",
      "Let me alone!",
      "Serpent, I say again!",
      "repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob,  I ve tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!",
      "I haven t the least idea what you re talking about,  said Alice.",
      "I ve tried the roots of trees, and I ve tried banks, and I ve tried\nhedges,  the Pigeon went on, without attending to her;  but those\nserpents!",
      "There s no pleasing them!",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
      "As if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs,  said the Pigeon;\n but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!",
      "Why, I\nhaven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!",
      "I m very sorry you ve been annoyed,  said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.",
      "And just as I d taken the highest tree in the wood,  continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek,  and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky!",
      "Ugh, Serpent!",
      "But I m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!",
      "said Alice.",
      "I m a I m a \n\n Well!",
      "_What_ are you?",
      "said the Pigeon.",
      "I can see you re trying to\ninvent something!",
      "I I m a little girl,  said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.",
      "A likely story indeed!",
      "said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt.",
      "I ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that!",
      "No, no!",
      "You re a serpent; and there s\nno use denying it.",
      "I suppose you ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!",
      "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,  said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild;  but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.",
      "I don t believe it,  said the Pigeon;  but if they do, why then\nthey re a kind of serpent, that s all I can say.",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,  You re\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you re a little girl or a serpent?",
      "It matters a good deal to _me_,  said Alice hastily;  but I m not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn t want\n_yours_: I don t like them raw.",
      "Well, be off, then!",
      "said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest.",
      "Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.",
      "After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual.",
      "Come, there s half my plan\ndone now!",
      "How puzzling all these changes are!",
      "I m never sure what I m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another!",
      "However, I ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?",
      "As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.",
      "Whoever lives there,  thought Alice,  it ll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!",
      "So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
      "CHAPTER VI.",
      "Pig and Pepper\n\n\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish) and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.",
      "It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads.",
      "She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone,  For the Duchess.",
      "An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.",
      "The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little,  From the Queen.",
      "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
      "There s no sort of use in knocking,  said the Footman,  and that for\ntwo reasons.",
      "First, because I m on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they re making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.",
      "And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.",
      "Please, then,  said Alice,  how am I to get in?",
      "There might be some sense in your knocking,  the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her,  if we had the door between us.",
      "For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil.",
      "But perhaps he can t help it, \nshe said to herself;  his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead.",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.",
      "How am I to get in?",
      "she repeated, aloud.",
      "I shall sit here,  the Footman remarked,  till tomorrow \n\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman s head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
      "or next day, maybe,  the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.",
      "How am I to get in?",
      "asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
      "_Are_ you to get in at all?",
      "said the Footman.",
      "That s the first\nquestion, you know.",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.",
      "It s really\ndreadful,  she muttered to herself,  the way all the creatures argue.",
      "It s enough to drive one crazy!",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations.",
      "I shall sit here,  he said,  on and off, for\ndays and days.",
      "But what am _I_ to do?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Anything you like,  said the Footman, and began whistling.",
      "Oh, there s no use in talking to him,  said Alice desperately:  he s\nperfectly idiotic!",
      "And she opened the door and went in.",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
      "There s certainly too much pepper in that soup!",
      "Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air.",
      "Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment s pause.",
      "The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
      "Please would you tell me,  said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,  why\nyour cat grins like that?",
      "It s a Cheshire cat,  said the Duchess,  and that s why.",
      "Pig!",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again: \n\n I didn t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn t\nknow that cats _could_ grin.",
      "They all can,  said the Duchess;  and most of  em do.",
      "I don t know of any that do,  Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.",
      "You don t know much,  said the Duchess;  and that s a fact.",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.",
      "While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.",
      "The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
      "Oh, _please_ mind what you re doing!",
      "cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror.",
      "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!",
      "as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.",
      "If everybody minded their own business,  the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl,  the world would go round a deal faster than it does.",
      "Which would _not_ be an advantage,  said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.",
      "Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night!",
      "You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis \n\n Talking of axes,  said the Duchess,  chop off her head!",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again:  Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve?",
      "I \n\n Oh, don t bother _me_,  said the Duchess;  I never could abide\nfigures!",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\n Speak roughly to your little boy,\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\n    Because he knows it teases.",
      "CHORUS.",
      "(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\n\n Wow!",
      "wow!",
      "wow!",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words: \n\n I speak severely to my boy,\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\n    The pepper when he pleases!",
      "CHORUS.",
      "Wow!",
      "wow!",
      "wow!",
      "Here!",
      "you may nurse it a bit, if you like!",
      "the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke.",
      "I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,  and she hurried out of the room.",
      "The cook\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n just like a star-fish,  thought Alice.",
      "The poor little thing was\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\nout into the open air.",
      "If I don t take this child away with me, \nthought Alice,  they re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?",
      "She said the last words out loud, and the\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).",
      "Don t grunt,  said Alice;  that s not at all a proper way of\nexpressing yourself.",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\nto see what was the matter with it.",
      "There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all.",
      "But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,  she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears.",
      "No, there were no tears.",
      "If you re going to turn into a pig, my dear, \nsaid Alice, seriously,  I ll have nothing more to do with you.",
      "Mind\nnow!",
      "The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself,  Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?",
      "when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",
      "This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood.",
      "If it had grown up,  she said to\nherself,  it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.",
      "And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself,  if one only knew the right way to change them  when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.",
      "It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
      "Cheshire Puss,  she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\nwider.",
      "Come, it s pleased so far,  thought Alice, and she went on.",
      "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?",
      "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,  said the Cat.",
      "I don t much care where  said Alice.",
      "Then it doesn t matter which way you go,  said the Cat.",
      "so long as I get _somewhere_,  Alice added as an explanation.",
      "Oh, you re sure to do that,  said the Cat,  if you only walk long\nenough.",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\nquestion.",
      "What sort of people live about here?",
      "In _that_ direction,  the Cat said, waving its right paw round,  lives\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,  waving the other paw,  lives a\nMarch Hare.",
      "Visit either you like: they re both mad.",
      "But I don t want to go among mad people,  Alice remarked.",
      "Oh, you can t help that,  said the Cat:  we re all mad here.",
      "I m mad.",
      "You re mad.",
      "How do you know I m mad?",
      "said Alice.",
      "You must be,  said the Cat,  or you wouldn t have come here.",
      "Alice didn t think that proved it at all; however, she went on  And how\ndo you know that you re mad?",
      "To begin with,  said the Cat,  a dog s not mad.",
      "You grant that?",
      "I suppose so,  said Alice.",
      "Well, then,  the Cat went on,  you see, a dog growls when it s angry,\nand wags its tail when it s pleased.",
      "Now _I_ growl when I m pleased,\nand wag my tail when I m angry.",
      "Therefore I m mad.",
      "_I_ call it purring, not growling,  said Alice.",
      "Call it what you like,  said the Cat.",
      "Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?",
      "I should like it very much,  said Alice,  but I haven t been invited\nyet.",
      "You ll see me there,  said the Cat, and vanished.",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening.",
      "While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.",
      "By-the-bye, what became of the baby?",
      "said the Cat.",
      "I d nearly\nforgotten to ask.",
      "It turned into a pig,  Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.",
      "I thought it would,  said the Cat, and vanished again.",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live.",
      "I ve seen hatters before,  she\nsaid to herself;  the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.",
      "As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
      "Did you say pig, or fig?",
      "said the Cat.",
      "I said pig,  replied Alice;  and I wish you wouldn t keep appearing\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.",
      "All right,  said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
      "Well!",
      "I ve often seen a cat without a grin,  thought Alice;  but a\ngrin without a cat!",
      "It s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.",
      "It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself  Suppose it should be raving mad after all!",
      "I almost wish I d gone to see the Hatter instead!",
      "CHAPTER VII.",
      "A Mad Tea-Party\n\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",
      "Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,  thought Alice;  only, as it s asleep,\nI suppose it doesn t mind.",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it:  No room!",
      "No room!",
      "they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming.",
      "There s _plenty_ of room!",
      "said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.",
      "Have some wine,  the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.",
      "I don t see any wine,  she remarked.",
      "There isn t any,  said the March Hare.",
      "Then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it,  said Alice angrily.",
      "It wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,  said\nthe March Hare.",
      "I didn t know it was _your_ table,  said Alice;  it s laid for a great\nmany more than three.",
      "Your hair wants cutting,  said the Hatter.",
      "He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.",
      "You should learn not to make personal remarks,  Alice said with some\nseverity;  it s very rude.",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas,  Why is a raven like a writing-desk?",
      "Come, we shall have some fun now!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "I m glad they ve\nbegun asking riddles.",
      "I believe I can guess that,  she added aloud.",
      "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?",
      "said\nthe March Hare.",
      "Exactly so,  said Alice.",
      "Then you should say what you mean,  the March Hare went on.",
      "I do,  Alice hastily replied;  at least at least I mean what I\nsay that s the same thing, you know.",
      "Not the same thing a bit!",
      "said the Hatter.",
      "You might just as well\nsay that  I see what I eat  is the same thing as  I eat what I see !",
      "You might just as well say,  added the March Hare,  that  I like what\nI get  is the same thing as  I get what I like !",
      "You might just as well say,  added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep,  that  I breathe when I sleep  is the same thing\nas  I sleep when I breathe !",
      "It _is_ the same thing with you,  said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn t much.",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence.",
      "What day of the month\nis it?",
      "he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said  The fourth.",
      "Two days wrong!",
      "sighed the Hatter.",
      "I told you butter wouldn t suit\nthe works!",
      "he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",
      "It was the _best_ butter,  the March Hare meekly replied.",
      "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,  the Hatter grumbled:\n you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife.",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark,  It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.",
      "What a\nfunny watch!",
      "she remarked.",
      "It tells the day of the month, and doesn t\ntell what o clock it is!",
      "Why should it?",
      "muttered the Hatter.",
      "Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?",
      "Of course not,  Alice replied very readily:  but that s because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.",
      "Which is just the case with _mine_,  said the Hatter.",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.",
      "The Hatter s remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.",
      "I don t quite\nunderstand you,  she said, as politely as she could.",
      "The Dormouse is asleep again,  said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes,  Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.",
      "Have you guessed the riddle yet?",
      "the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.",
      "No, I give it up,  Alice replied:  what s the answer?",
      "I haven t the slightest idea,  said the Hatter.",
      "Nor I,  said the March Hare.",
      "Alice sighed wearily.",
      "I think you might do something better with the\ntime,  she said,  than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.",
      "If you knew Time as well as I do,  said the Hatter,  you wouldn t talk\nabout wasting _it_.",
      "It s _him_.",
      "I don t know what you mean,  said Alice.",
      "Of course you don t!",
      "the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously.",
      "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!",
      "Perhaps not,  Alice cautiously replied:  but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.",
      "Ah!",
      "that accounts for it,  said the Hatter.",
      "He won t stand beating.",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock.",
      "For instance, suppose it were nine o clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!",
      "Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!",
      "( I only wish it was,  the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)",
      "That would be grand, certainly,  said Alice thoughtfully:  but then I\nshouldn t be hungry for it, you know.",
      "Not at first, perhaps,  said the Hatter:  but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.",
      "Is that the way _you_ manage?",
      "Alice asked.",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully.",
      "Not I!",
      "he replied.",
      "We\nquarrelled last March just before _he_ went mad, you know  (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,)  it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n\n Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!",
      "How I wonder what you re at!",
      "You know the song, perhaps?",
      "I ve heard something like it,  said Alice.",
      "It goes on, you know,  the Hatter continued,  in this way: \n\n Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.",
      "Twinkle, twinkle \n\n\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n _Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_  and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.",
      "Well, I d hardly finished the first verse,  said the Hatter,  when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out,  He s murdering the time!",
      "Off with his\nhead!",
      "How dreadfully savage!",
      "exclaimed Alice.",
      "And ever since that,  the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,  he won t\ndo a thing I ask!",
      "It s always six o clock now.",
      "A bright idea came into Alice s head.",
      "Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?",
      "she asked.",
      "Yes, that s it,  said the Hatter with a sigh:  it s always tea-time,\nand we ve no time to wash the things between whiles.",
      "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Exactly so,  said the Hatter:  as the things get used up.",
      "But what happens when you come to the beginning again?",
      "Alice ventured\nto ask.",
      "Suppose we change the subject,  the March Hare interrupted, yawning.",
      "I m getting tired of this.",
      "I vote the young lady tells us a story.",
      "I m afraid I don t know one,  said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.",
      "Then the Dormouse shall!",
      "they both cried.",
      "Wake up, Dormouse!",
      "And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.",
      "I wasn t asleep,  he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice:  I heard every word you fellows were saying.",
      "Tell us a story!",
      "said the March Hare.",
      "Yes, please do!",
      "pleaded Alice.",
      "And be quick about it,  added the Hatter,  or you ll be asleep again\nbefore it s done.",
      "Once upon a time there were three little sisters,  the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry;  and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well \n\n What did they live on?",
      "said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.",
      "They lived on treacle,  said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.",
      "They couldn t have done that, you know,  Alice gently remarked;\n they d have been ill.",
      "So they were,  said the Dormouse;  _very_ ill. \n\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on:  But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?",
      "Take some more tea,  the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",
      "I ve had nothing yet,  Alice replied in an offended tone,  so I can t\ntake more.",
      "You mean you can t take _less_,  said the Hatter:  it s very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.",
      "Nobody asked _your_ opinion,  said Alice.",
      "Who s making personal remarks now?",
      "the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question.",
      "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid,  It was a treacle-well.",
      "There s no such thing!",
      "Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went  Sh!",
      "sh!",
      "and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked,  If you can t be civil, you d better finish the story for\nyourself.",
      "No, please go on!",
      "Alice said very humbly;  I won t interrupt again.",
      "I\ndare say there may be _one_.",
      "One, indeed!",
      "said the Dormouse indignantly.",
      "However, he consented to\ngo on.",
      "And so these three little sisters they were learning to draw,\nyou know \n\n What did they draw?",
      "said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.",
      "Treacle,  said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.",
      "I want a clean cup,  interrupted the Hatter:  let s all move one place\non.",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare.",
      "The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously:  But I don t understand.",
      "Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?",
      "You can draw water out of a water-well,  said the Hatter;  so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well eh, stupid?",
      "But they were _in_ the well,  Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.",
      "Of course they were,  said the Dormouse;  well in.",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.",
      "They were learning to draw,  the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy;  and they drew all manner of\nthings everything that begins with an M \n\n Why with an M?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Why not?",
      "said the March Hare.",
      "Alice was silent.",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on:  that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness you know you say\nthings are  much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?",
      "Really, now you ask me,  said Alice, very much confused,  I don t\nthink \n\n Then you shouldn t talk,  said the Hatter.",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.",
      "At any rate I ll never go _there_ again!",
      "said Alice as she picked her\nway through the wood.",
      "It s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\nall my life!",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\nleading right into it.",
      "That s very curious!",
      "she thought.",
      "But\neverything s curious today.",
      "I think I may as well go in at once.",
      "And\nin she went.",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table.",
      "Now, I ll manage better this time,  she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden.",
      "Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_ she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.",
      "CHAPTER VIII.",
      "The Queen s Croquet-Ground\n\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red.",
      "Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say,  Look out now, Five!",
      "Don t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!",
      "I couldn t help it,  said Five, in a sulky tone;  Seven jogged my\nelbow.",
      "On which Seven looked up and said,  That s right, Five!",
      "Always lay the\nblame on others!",
      "_You d_ better not talk!",
      "said Five.",
      "I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!",
      "What for?",
      "said the one who had spoken first.",
      "That s none of _your_ business, Two!",
      "said Seven.",
      "Yes, it _is_ his business!",
      "said Five,  and I ll tell him it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.",
      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun  Well, of all the unjust\nthings  when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.",
      "Would you tell me,  said Alice, a little timidly,  why you are\npainting those roses?",
      "Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.",
      "Two began in a low\nvoice,  Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.",
      "So\nyou see, Miss, we re doing our best, afore she comes, to  At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout  The Queen!",
      "The Queen!",
      "and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces.",
      "There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.",
      "After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts.",
      "Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her.",
      "Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions;  and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,  thought she,  if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn t see it?",
      "So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely  Who is this?",
      "She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
      "Idiot!",
      "said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on,  What s your name, child?",
      "My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,  said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself,  Why, they re only a pack of cards, after\nall.",
      "I needn t be afraid of them!",
      "And who are _these?_  said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.",
      "How should _I_ know?",
      "said Alice, surprised at her own courage.",
      "It s\nno business of _mine_.",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed  Off with her head!",
      "Off \n\n Nonsense!",
      "said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said  Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave  Turn\nthem over!",
      "The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
      "Get up!",
      "said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.",
      "Leave off that!",
      "screamed the Queen.",
      "You make me giddy.",
      "And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on,  What _have_ you been doing\nhere?",
      "May it please your Majesty,  said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke,  we were trying \n\n _I_ see!",
      "said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.",
      "Off with their heads!",
      "and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.",
      "You shan t be beheaded!",
      "said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near.",
      "The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.",
      "Are their heads off?",
      "shouted the Queen.",
      "Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!",
      "the soldiers shouted\nin reply.",
      "That s right!",
      "shouted the Queen.",
      "Can you play croquet?",
      "The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\nevidently meant for her.",
      "Yes!",
      "shouted Alice.",
      "Come on, then!",
      "roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\nwondering very much what would happen next.",
      "It s it s a very fine day!",
      "said a timid voice at her side.",
      "She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
      "Very,  said Alice:  where s the Duchess?",
      "Hush!",
      "Hush!",
      "said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.",
      "He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered  She s under\nsentence of execution.",
      "What for?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Did you say  What a pity!",
      "?",
      "the Rabbit asked.",
      "No, I didn t,  said Alice:  I don t think it s at all a pity.",
      "I said\n What for?",
      "She boxed the Queen s ears  the Rabbit began.",
      "Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter.",
      "Oh, hush!",
      "the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone.",
      "The Queen will hear you!",
      "You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said \n\n Get to your places!",
      "shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan.",
      "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\nshouting  Off with his head!",
      "or  Off with her head!",
      "about once in a\nminute.",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n and then,  thought she,  what would become of me?",
      "They re dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there s any\none left alive!",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself  It s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.",
      "How are you getting on?",
      "said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.",
      "It s no use\nspeaking to it,  she thought,  till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.",
      "In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her.",
      "The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
      "I don t think they play at all fairly,  Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone,  and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear\noneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there s the\narch I ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground and I should have croqueted the Queen s hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!",
      "How do you like the Queen?",
      "said the Cat in a low voice.",
      "Not at all,  said Alice:  she s so extremely  Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n likely to win, that it s hardly worth while finishing the game.",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.",
      "Who _are_ you talking to?",
      "said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat s head with great curiosity.",
      "It s a friend of mine a Cheshire Cat,  said Alice:  allow me to\nintroduce it.",
      "I don t like the look of it at all,  said the King:  however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.",
      "I d rather not,  the Cat remarked.",
      "Don t be impertinent,  said the King,  and don t look at me like\nthat!",
      "He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
      "A cat may look at a king,  said Alice.",
      "I ve read that in some book,\nbut I don t remember where.",
      "Well, it must be removed,  said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment,  My dear!",
      "I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall.",
      "Off with his head!",
      "she said, without even looking round.",
      "I ll fetch the executioner myself,  said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen s voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion.",
      "She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not.",
      "So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:  but it doesn t\nmatter much,  thought Alice,  as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.",
      "So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.",
      "The executioner s argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn t going to begin at _his_ time of life.",
      "The King s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense.",
      "The Queen s argument was, that if something wasn t done about it in\nless than no time she d have everybody executed, all round.",
      "(It was\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\nanxious.)",
      "Alice could think of nothing else to say but  It belongs to the\nDuchess: you d better ask _her_ about it.",
      "She s in prison,  the Queen said to the executioner:  fetch her here.",
      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
      "The Cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.",
      "CHAPTER IX.",
      "The Mock Turtle s Story\n\n\n You can t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!",
      "said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice s,\nand they walked off together.",
      "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.",
      "When _I m_ a Duchess,  she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though),  I won t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.",
      "Soup\ndoes very well without Maybe it s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,  she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule,  and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes\nthem bitter and and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered.",
      "I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn t be\nso stingy about it, you know \n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear.",
      "You re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.",
      "I can t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.",
      "Perhaps it hasn t one,  Alice ventured to remark.",
      "Tut, tut, child!",
      "said the Duchess.",
      "Everything s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.",
      "And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice s side as\nshe spoke.",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice s shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin.",
      "However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.",
      "The game s going on rather better now,  she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.",
      "Tis so,  said the Duchess:  and the moral of that is Oh,  tis love,\n tis love, that makes the world go round!",
      "Somebody said,  Alice whispered,  that it s done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!",
      "Ah, well!",
      "It means much the same thing,  said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice s shoulder as she added,  and the moral of\n_that_ is Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.",
      "How fond she is of finding morals in things!",
      "Alice thought to\nherself.",
      "I dare say you re wondering why I don t put my arm round your waist, \nthe Duchess said after a pause:  the reason is, that I m doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo.",
      "Shall I try the experiment?",
      "He might bite,  Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.",
      "Very true,  said the Duchess:  flamingoes and mustard both bite.",
      "And\nthe moral of that is Birds of a feather flock together.",
      "Only mustard isn t a bird,  Alice remarked.",
      "Right, as usual,  said the Duchess:  what a clear way you have of\nputting things!",
      "It s a mineral, I _think_,  said Alice.",
      "Of course it is,  said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said;  there s a large mustard-mine near here.",
      "And the moral of that is The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.",
      "Oh, I know!",
      "exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark,  it s a vegetable.",
      "It doesn t look like one, but it is.",
      "I quite agree with you,  said the Duchess;  and the moral of that\nis Be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more\nsimply Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.",
      "I think I should understand that better,  Alice said very politely,\n if I had it written down: but I can t quite follow it as you say it.",
      "That s nothing to what I could say if I chose,  the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.",
      "Pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,  said\nAlice.",
      "Oh, don t talk about trouble!",
      "said the Duchess.",
      "I make you a present\nof everything I ve said as yet.",
      "A cheap sort of present!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "I m glad they don t give\nbirthday presents like that!",
      "But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.",
      "Thinking again?",
      "the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.",
      "I ve a right to think,  said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.",
      "Just about as much right,  said the Duchess,  as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m \n\nBut here, to Alice s great surprise, the Duchess s voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word  moral,  and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble.",
      "Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.",
      "A fine day, your Majesty!",
      "the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
      "Now, I give you fair warning,  shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke;  either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time!",
      "Take your choice!",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
      "Let s go on with the game,  the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment s delay\nwould cost them their lives.",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting  Off with his head!",
      "or  Off with\nher head!",
      "Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution.",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice,  Have\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?",
      "No,  said Alice.",
      "I don t even know what a Mock Turtle is.",
      "It s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,  said the Queen.",
      "I never saw one, or heard of one,  said Alice.",
      "Come on, then,  said the Queen,  and he shall tell you his history, \n\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally,  You are all pardoned.",
      "Come, _that s_ a\ngood thing!",
      "she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.",
      "(If\nyou don t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)",
      "Up, lazy\nthing!",
      "said the Queen,  and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history.",
      "I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;  and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon.",
      "Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled.",
      "What fun!",
      "said the Gryphon,\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.",
      "What _is_ the fun?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Why, _she_,  said the Gryphon.",
      "It s all her fancy, that: they never\nexecutes nobody, you know.",
      "Come on!",
      "Everybody says  come on!",
      "here,  thought Alice, as she went slowly\nafter it:  I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",
      "She\npitied him deeply.",
      "What is his sorrow?",
      "she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before,  It s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn t got no sorrow, you know.",
      "Come on!",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",
      "This here young lady,  said the Gryphon,  she wants for to know your\nhistory, she do.",
      "I ll tell it her,  said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone:  sit\ndown, both of you, and don t speak a word till I ve finished.",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.",
      "Alice thought to\nherself,  I don t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn t begin.",
      "But she waited patiently.",
      "Once,  said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh,  I was a real\nTurtle.",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\noccasional exclamation of  Hjckrrh!",
      "from the Gryphon, and the constant\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.",
      "Alice was very nearly getting up and\nsaying,  Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,  but she could not\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\nnothing.",
      "When we were little,  the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\nthough still sobbing a little now and then,  we went to school in the\nsea.",
      "The master was an old Turtle we used to call him Tortoise \n\n Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn t one?",
      "Alice asked.",
      "We called him Tortoise because he taught us,  said the Mock Turtle\nangrily:  really you are very dull!",
      "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\nquestion,  added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.",
      "At last the\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle,  Drive on, old fellow!",
      "Don t be all\nday about it!",
      "and he went on in these words:\n\n Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn t believe it \n\n I never said I didn t!",
      "interrupted Alice.",
      "You did,  said the Mock Turtle.",
      "Hold your tongue!",
      "added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.",
      "We had the best of educations in fact, we went to school every day \n\n _I ve_ been to a day-school, too,  said Alice;  you needn t be so\nproud as all that.",
      "With extras?",
      "asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.",
      "Yes,  said Alice,  we learned French and music.",
      "And washing?",
      "said the Mock Turtle.",
      "Certainly not!",
      "said Alice indignantly.",
      "Ah!",
      "then yours wasn t a really good school,  said the Mock Turtle in a\ntone of great relief.",
      "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n French, music, _and washing_ extra.",
      "You couldn t have wanted it much,  said Alice;  living at the bottom\nof the sea.",
      "I couldn t afford to learn it.",
      "said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.",
      "I\nonly took the regular course.",
      "What was that?",
      "inquired Alice.",
      "Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,  the Mock Turtle\nreplied;  and then the different branches of Arithmetic Ambition,\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.",
      "I never heard of  Uglification,  Alice ventured to say.",
      "What is it?",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.",
      "What!",
      "Never heard of\nuglifying!",
      "it exclaimed.",
      "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?",
      "Yes,  said Alice doubtfully:  it means to make anything prettier.",
      "Well, then,  the Gryphon went on,  if you don t know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said  What else had you to learn?",
      "Well, there was Mystery,  the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers,  Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.",
      "What was _that_ like?",
      "said Alice.",
      "Well, I can t show it you myself,  the Mock Turtle said:  I m too\nstiff.",
      "And the Gryphon never learnt it.",
      "Hadn t time,  said the Gryphon:  I went to the Classics master,\nthough.",
      "He was an old crab, _he_ was.",
      "I never went to him,  the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.",
      "So he did, so he did,  said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.",
      "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?",
      "said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.",
      "Ten hours the first day,  said the Mock Turtle:  nine the next, and so\non.",
      "What a curious plan!",
      "exclaimed Alice.",
      "That s the reason they re called lessons,  the Gryphon remarked:\n because they lessen from day to day.",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\nbefore she made her next remark.",
      "Then the eleventh day must have been\na holiday?",
      "Of course it was,  said the Mock Turtle.",
      "And how did you manage on the twelfth?",
      "Alice went on eagerly.",
      "That s enough about lessons,  the Gryphon interrupted in a very\ndecided tone:  tell her something about the games now.",
      "CHAPTER X.",
      "The Lobster Quadrille\n\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\nhis eyes.",
      "He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\ntwo sobs choked his voice.",
      "Same as if he had a bone in his throat, \nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\nthe back.",
      "At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again: \n\n You may not have lived much under the sea  ( I haven t,  said\nAlice) and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster \n(Alice began to say  I once tasted  but checked herself hastily, and\nsaid  No, never )  so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\nLobster Quadrille is!",
      "No, indeed,  said Alice.",
      "What sort of a dance is it?",
      "Why,  said the Gryphon,  you first form into a line along the\nsea-shore \n\n Two lines!",
      "cried the Mock Turtle.",
      "Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\nthen, when you ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way \n\n _That_ generally takes some time,  interrupted the Gryphon.",
      "you advance twice \n\n Each with a lobster as a partner!",
      "cried the Gryphon.",
      "Of course,  the Mock Turtle said:  advance twice, set to partners \n\n change lobsters, and retire in same order,  continued the Gryphon.",
      "Then, you know,  the Mock Turtle went on,  you throw the \n\n The lobsters!",
      "shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.",
      "as far out to sea as you can \n\n Swim after them!",
      "screamed the Gryphon.",
      "Turn a somersault in the sea!",
      "cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\nabout.",
      "Change lobsters again!",
      "yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.",
      "Back to land again, and that s all the first figure,  said the Mock\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.",
      "It must be a very pretty dance,  said Alice timidly.",
      "Would you like to see a little of it?",
      "said the Mock Turtle.",
      "Very much indeed,  said Alice.",
      "Come, let s try the first figure!",
      "said the Mock Turtle to the\nGryphon.",
      "We can do without lobsters, you know.",
      "Which shall sing?",
      "Oh, _you_ sing,  said the Gryphon.",
      "I ve forgotten the words.",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly: \n\n Will you walk a little faster?",
      "said a whiting to a snail.",
      "There s a porpoise close behind us, and he s treading on my tail.",
      "See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!",
      "They are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance?",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?",
      "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!",
      "But the snail replied  Too far, too far!",
      "and gave a look askance \nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.",
      "Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.",
      "What matters it how far we go?",
      "his scaly friend replied.",
      "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.",
      "The further off from England the nearer is to France \nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?",
      "Will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?",
      "Thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch,  said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last:  and I do so like that\ncurious song about the whiting!",
      "Oh, as to the whiting,  said the Mock Turtle,  they you ve seen them,\nof course?",
      "Yes,  said Alice,  I ve often seen them at dinn  she checked herself\nhastily.",
      "I don t know where Dinn may be,  said the Mock Turtle,  but if you ve\nseen them so often, of course you know what they re like.",
      "I believe so,  Alice replied thoughtfully.",
      "They have their tails in\ntheir mouths and they re all over crumbs.",
      "You re wrong about the crumbs,  said the Mock Turtle:  crumbs would\nall wash off in the sea.",
      "But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\nand the reason is  here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\neyes.",
      "Tell her about the reason and all that,  he said to the Gryphon.",
      "The reason is,  said the Gryphon,  that they _would_ go with the\nlobsters to the dance.",
      "So they got thrown out to sea.",
      "So they had to\nfall a long way.",
      "So they got their tails fast in their mouths.",
      "So they\ncouldn t get them out again.",
      "That s all.",
      "Thank you,  said Alice,  it s very interesting.",
      "I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.",
      "I can tell you more than that, if you like,  said the Gryphon.",
      "Do you\nknow why it s called a whiting?",
      "I never thought about it,  said Alice.",
      "Why?",
      "_It does the boots and shoes_,  the Gryphon replied very solemnly.",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled.",
      "Does the boots and shoes!",
      "she repeated\nin a wondering tone.",
      "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?",
      "said the Gryphon.",
      "I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer.",
      "They re done with blacking, I believe.",
      "Boots and shoes under the sea,  the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n are done with a whiting.",
      "Now you know.",
      "And what are they made of?",
      "Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.",
      "Soles and eels, of course,  the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n any shrimp could have told you that.",
      "If I d been the whiting,  said Alice, whose thoughts were still\nrunning on the song,  I d have said to the porpoise,  Keep back,\nplease: we don t want _you_ with us!",
      "They were obliged to have him with them,  the Mock Turtle said:  no\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.",
      "Wouldn t it really?",
      "said Alice in a tone of great surprise.",
      "Of course not,  said the Mock Turtle:  why, if a fish came to _me_,\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say  With what porpoise?",
      "Don t you mean  purpose ?",
      "said Alice.",
      "I mean what I say,  the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.",
      "And\nthe Gryphon added  Come, let s hear some of _your_ adventures.",
      "I could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning,  said\nAlice a little timidly:  but it s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.",
      "Explain all that,  said the Mock Turtle.",
      "No, no!",
      "The adventures first,  said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n explanations take such a dreadful time.",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit.",
      "She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on.",
      "Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating  _You are old, Father William_,  to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said  That s very curious.",
      "It s all about as curious as it can be,  said the Gryphon.",
      "It all came different!",
      "the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.",
      "I\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now.",
      "Tell her to\nbegin.",
      "He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.",
      "Stand up and repeat  _Tis the voice of the sluggard_,  said the\nGryphon.",
      "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!",
      "thought Alice;  I might as well be at school at once.",
      "However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed: \n\n Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.",
      "As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.",
      "[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]",
      "That s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,  said\nthe Gryphon.",
      "Well, I never heard it before,  said the Mock Turtle;  but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.",
      "Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.",
      "I should like to have it explained,  said the Mock Turtle.",
      "She can t explain it,  said the Gryphon hastily.",
      "Go on with the next\nverse.",
      "But about his toes?",
      "the Mock Turtle persisted.",
      "How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?",
      "It s the first position in dancing.",
      "Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.",
      "Go on with the next verse,  the Gryphon repeated impatiently:  it\nbegins  _I passed by his garden_.",
      "Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice: \n\n I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie \n\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.",
      "When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet ]\n\n\n What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,  the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted,  if you don t explain it as you go on?",
      "It s by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!",
      "Yes, I think you d better leave off,  said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.",
      "Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?",
      "the Gryphon\nwent on.",
      "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?",
      "Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,  Alice\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\n Hm!",
      "No accounting for tastes!",
      "Sing her  _Turtle Soup_,  will you, old\nfellow?",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this: \n\n Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!",
      "Who for such dainties would not stoop?",
      "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!",
      "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!",
      "Beau ootiful Soo oop!",
      "Beau ootiful Soo oop!",
      "Soo oop of the e e evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",
      "Beautiful Soup!",
      "Who cares for fish,\nGame, or any other dish?",
      "Who would not give all else for two p\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
      "Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?",
      "Beau ootiful Soo oop!",
      "Beau ootiful Soo oop!",
      "Soo oop of the e e evening,\n    Beautiful, beauti FUL SOUP!",
      "Chorus again!",
      "cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\nto repeat it, when a cry of  The trial s beginning!",
      "was heard in the\ndistance.",
      "Come on!",
      "cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.",
      "What trial is it?",
      "Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\nanswered  Come on!",
      "and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: \n\n Soo oop of the e e evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!",
      "CHAPTER XI.",
      "Who Stole the Tarts?",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",
      "In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them I wish they d\nget the trial done,  she thought,  and hand round the refreshments!",
      "But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there.",
      "That s the judge,  she said to\nherself,  because of his great wig.",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
      "And that s the jury-box,  thought Alice,  and those twelve creatures, \n(she was obliged to say  creatures,  you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,)  I suppose they are the jurors.",
      "She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.",
      "However,  jury-men \nwould have done just as well.",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.",
      "What are\nthey doing?",
      "Alice whispered to the Gryphon.",
      "They can t have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial s begun.",
      "They re putting down their names,  the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.",
      "Stupid things!",
      "Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out,  Silence in the\ncourt!",
      "and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking.",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down  stupid things!",
      "on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell\n stupid,  and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.",
      "A nice\nmuddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.",
      "This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away.",
      "She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
      "Herald, read the accusation!",
      "said the King.",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: \n\n The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n    All on a summer day:\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n    And took them quite away!",
      "Consider your verdict,  the King said to the jury.",
      "Not yet, not yet!",
      "the Rabbit hastily interrupted.",
      "There s a great\ndeal to come before that!",
      "Call the first witness,  said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out,  First witness!",
      "The first witness was the Hatter.",
      "He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.",
      "I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,  he began,  for bringing these in: but I hadn t quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.",
      "You ought to have finished,  said the King.",
      "When did you begin?",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.",
      "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\nwas,  he said.",
      "Fifteenth,  said the March Hare.",
      "Sixteenth,  added the Dormouse.",
      "Write that down,  the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
      "Take off your hat,  the King said to the Hatter.",
      "It isn t mine,  said the Hatter.",
      "_Stolen!_  the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\na memorandum of the fact.",
      "I keep them to sell,  the Hatter added as an explanation;  I ve none\nof my own.",
      "I m a hatter.",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.",
      "Give your evidence,  said the King;  and don t be nervous, or I ll\nhave you executed on the spot.",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.",
      "I wish you wouldn t squeeze so.",
      "said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her.",
      "I can hardly breathe.",
      "I can t help it,  said Alice very meekly:  I m growing.",
      "You ve no right to grow _here_,  said the Dormouse.",
      "Don t talk nonsense,  said Alice more boldly:  you know you re growing\ntoo.",
      "Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,  said the Dormouse:  not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.",
      "And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court,  Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!",
      "on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.",
      "Give your evidence,  the King repeated angrily,  or I ll have you\nexecuted, whether you re nervous or not.",
      "I m a poor man, your Majesty,  the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n and I hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea \n\n The twinkling of the _what?_  said the King.",
      "It _began_ with the tea,  the Hatter replied.",
      "Of course twinkling begins with a T!",
      "said the King sharply.",
      "Do you\ntake me for a dunce?",
      "Go on!",
      "I m a poor man,  the Hatter went on,  and most things twinkled after\nthat only the March Hare said \n\n I didn t!",
      "the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
      "You did!",
      "said the Hatter.",
      "I deny it!",
      "said the March Hare.",
      "He denies it,  said the King:  leave out that part.",
      "Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said  the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.",
      "After that,  continued the Hatter,  I cut some more bread-and-butter \n\n But what did the Dormouse say?",
      "one of the jury asked.",
      "That I can t remember,  said the Hatter.",
      "You _must_ remember,  remarked the King,  or I ll have you executed.",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee.",
      "I m a poor man, your Majesty,  he began.",
      "You re a _very_ poor _speaker_,  said the King.",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court.",
      "(As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done.",
      "They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)",
      "I m glad I ve seen that done,  thought Alice.",
      "I ve so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials,  There was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,  and I never understood what it meant till now.",
      "If that s all you know about it, you may stand down,  continued the\nKing.",
      "I can t go no lower,  said the Hatter:  I m on the floor, as it is.",
      "Then you may _sit_ down,  the King replied.",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.",
      "Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!",
      "thought Alice.",
      "Now we shall get\non better.",
      "I d rather finish my tea,  said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
      "You may go,  said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.",
      "and just take his head off outside,  the Queen added to one of the\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\nto the door.",
      "Call the next witness!",
      "said the King.",
      "The next witness was the Duchess s cook.",
      "She carried the pepper-box in\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",
      "Give your evidence,  said the King.",
      "Shan t,  said the cook.",
      "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\n Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.",
      "Well, if I must, I must,  the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice,  What are tarts made of?",
      "Pepper, mostly,  said the cook.",
      "Treacle,  said a sleepy voice behind her.",
      "Collar that Dormouse,  the Queen shrieked out.",
      "Behead that Dormouse!",
      "Turn that Dormouse out of court!",
      "Suppress him!",
      "Pinch him!",
      "Off with his\nwhiskers!",
      "For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\ndisappeared.",
      "Never mind!",
      "said the King, with an air of great relief.",
      "Call the\nnext witness.",
      "And he added in an undertone to the Queen,  Really, my\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness.",
      "It quite makes my\nforehead ache!",
      "Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like,  for they\nhaven t got much evidence _yet_,  she said to herself.",
      "Imagine her\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\nlittle voice, the name  Alice!",
      "CHAPTER XII.",
      "Alice s Evidence\n\n\n Here!",
      "cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
      "Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!",
      "she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\njury-box, or they would die.",
      "The trial cannot proceed,  said the King in a very grave voice,  until\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places _all_,  he repeated\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
      "She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right;  not that it signifies much,  she\nsaid to herself;  I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.",
      "What do you know about this business?",
      "the King said to Alice.",
      "Nothing,  said Alice.",
      "Nothing _whatever?_  persisted the King.",
      "Nothing whatever,  said Alice.",
      "That s very important,  the King said, turning to the jury.",
      "They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted:  _Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,  he\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\nhe spoke.",
      "_Un_important, of course, I meant,  the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\n important unimportant unimportant important  as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best.",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down  important,  and some  unimportant.",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n but it doesn t matter a bit,  she thought to herself.",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out  Silence!",
      "and read out from his book,  Rule\nForty-two.",
      "_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.",
      "Everybody looked at Alice.",
      "_I m_ not a mile high,  said Alice.",
      "You are,  said the King.",
      "Nearly two miles high,  added the Queen.",
      "Well, I shan t go, at any rate,  said Alice:  besides, that s not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.",
      "It s the oldest rule in the book,  said the King.",
      "Then it ought to be Number One,  said Alice.",
      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.",
      "Consider your\nverdict,  he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",
      "There s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,  said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry;  this paper has just been\npicked up.",
      "What s in it?",
      "said the Queen.",
      "I haven t opened it yet,  said the White Rabbit,  but it seems to be a\nletter, written by the prisoner to to somebody.",
      "It must have been that,  said the King,  unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn t usual, you know.",
      "Who is it directed to?",
      "said one of the jurymen.",
      "It isn t directed at all,  said the White Rabbit;  in fact, there s\nnothing written on the _outside_.",
      "He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added  It isn t a letter, after all: it s a set of verses.",
      "Are they in the prisoner s handwriting?",
      "asked another of the jurymen.",
      "No, they re not,  said the White Rabbit,  and that s the queerest\nthing about it.",
      "(The jury all looked puzzled.)",
      "He must have imitated somebody else s hand,  said the King.",
      "(The jury\nall brightened up again.)",
      "Please your Majesty,  said the Knave,  I didn t write it, and they\ncan t prove I did: there s no name signed at the end.",
      "If you didn t sign it,  said the King,  that only makes the matter\nworse.",
      "You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.",
      "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.",
      "That _proves_ his guilt,  said the Queen.",
      "It proves nothing of the sort!",
      "said Alice.",
      "Why, you don t even know\nwhat they re about!",
      "Read them,  said the King.",
      "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.",
      "Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?",
      "he asked.",
      "Begin at the beginning,  the King said gravely,  and go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.",
      "These were the verses the White Rabbit read: \n\n They told me you had been to her,\n    And mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\n    But said I could not swim.",
      "He sent them word I had not gone\n    (We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\n    What would become of you?",
      "I gave her one, they gave him two,\n    You gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\n    Though they were mine before.",
      "If I or she should chance to be\n    Involved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\n    Exactly as we were.",
      "My notion was that you had been\n    (Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.",
      "Don t let him know she liked them best,\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.",
      "That s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet,  said the\nKing, rubbing his hands;  so now let the jury \n\n If any one of them can explain it,  said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,)  I ll give him sixpence.",
      "_I_ don t believe there s\nan atom of meaning in it.",
      "The jury all wrote down on their slates,  _She_ doesn t believe there s\nan atom of meaning in it,  but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.",
      "If there s no meaning in it,  said the King,  that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn t try to find any.",
      "And yet I don t\nknow,  he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye;  I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.",
      "_said I could not swim_  you can t swim, can you?",
      "he added, turning\nto the Knave.",
      "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
      "Do I look like it?",
      "he said.",
      "(Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)",
      "All right, so far,  said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself:  _We know it to be true_  that s the jury, of\ncourse _I gave her one, they gave him two_  why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know \n\n But, it goes on  _they all returned from him to you_,  said Alice.",
      "Why, there they are!",
      "said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table.",
      "Nothing can be clearer than _that_.",
      "Then\nagain _before she had this fit_  you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?",
      "he said to the Queen.",
      "Never!",
      "said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke.",
      "(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)",
      "Then the words don t _fit_ you,  said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile.",
      "There was a dead silence.",
      "It s a pun!",
      "the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed,  Let the jury consider their verdict,  the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.",
      "No, no!",
      "said the Queen.",
      "Sentence first verdict afterwards.",
      "Stuff and nonsense!",
      "said Alice loudly.",
      "The idea of having the\nsentence first!",
      "Hold your tongue!",
      "said the Queen, turning purple.",
      "I won t!",
      "said Alice.",
      "Off with her head!",
      "the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.",
      "Nobody\nmoved.",
      "Who cares for you?",
      "said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.)",
      "You re nothing but a pack of cards!",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
      "Wake up, Alice dear!",
      "said her sister;  Why, what a long sleep you ve\nhad!",
      "Oh, I ve had such a curious dream!",
      "said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said,  It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it s getting late.",
      "So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream: \n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister s dream.",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle s heavy sobs.",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.",

      "PART ONE\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its\nown way.",
      "Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys  house.",
      "The wife had\ndiscovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French\ngirl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced\nto her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with\nhim.",
      "This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only\nthe husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family\nand household, were painfully conscious of it.",
      "Every person in the\nhouse felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that\nthe stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in\ncommon with one another than they, the members of the family and\nhousehold of the Oblonskys.",
      "The wife did not leave her own room, the\nhusband had not been at home for three days.",
      "The children ran wild all\nover the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper,\nand wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for\nher; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time;\nthe kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.",
      "Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch\nOblonsky Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at\nhis usual hour, that is, at eight o clock in the morning, not in his\nwife s bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study.",
      "He turned\nover his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he\nwould sink into a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow\non the other side and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped\nup, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.",
      "Yes, yes, how was it now?",
      "he thought, going over his dream.",
      "Now, how\nwas it?",
      "To be sure!",
      "Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not\nDarmstadt, but something American.",
      "Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in\nAmerica.",
      "Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the\ntables sang, _Il mio tesoro_ not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something\nbetter, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and\nthey were women, too,  he remembered.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a\nsmile.",
      "Yes, it was nice, very nice.",
      "There was a great deal more that\nwas delightful, only there s no putting it into words, or even\nexpressing it in one s thoughts awake.",
      "And noticing a gleam of light\npeeping in beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his\nfeet over the edge of the sofa, and felt about with them for his\nslippers, a present on his last birthday, worked for him by his wife on\ngold-colored morocco.",
      "And, as he had done every day for the last nine\nyears, he stretched out his hand, without getting up, towards the place\nwhere his dressing-gown always hung in his bedroom.",
      "And thereupon he\nsuddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his wife s room, but in\nhis study, and why: the smile vanished from his face, he knitted his\nbrows.",
      "Ah, ah, ah!",
      "Oo!...",
      "he muttered, recalling everything that had\nhappened.",
      "And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was\npresent to his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and\nworst of all, his own fault.",
      "Yes, she won t forgive me, and she can t forgive me.",
      "And the most\nawful thing about it is that it s all my fault all my fault, though I m\nnot to blame.",
      "That s the point of the whole situation,  he reflected.",
      "Oh, oh, oh!",
      "he kept repeating in despair, as he remembered the\nacutely painful sensations caused him by this quarrel.",
      "Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and\ngood-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his\nwife, he had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise\nhad not found her in the study either, and saw her at last in her\nbedroom with the unlucky letter that revealed everything in her hand.",
      "She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details,\nand limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still\nwith the letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of\nhorror, despair, and indignation.",
      "What s this?",
      "this?",
      "she asked, pointing to the letter.",
      "And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case,\nwas not so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he\nhad met his wife s words.",
      "There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when\nthey are unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful.",
      "He did not\nsucceed in adapting his face to the position in which he was placed\ntowards his wife by the discovery of his fault.",
      "Instead of being hurt,\ndenying, defending himself, begging forgiveness, instead of remaining\nindifferent even anything would have been better than what he did\ndo his face utterly involuntarily (reflex spinal action, reflected\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of physiology) utterly involuntarily\nassumed its habitual, good-humored, and therefore idiotic smile.",
      "This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself.",
      "Catching sight of that\nsmile, Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her\ncharacteristic heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the\nroom.",
      "Since then she had refused to see her husband.",
      "It s that idiotic smile that s to blame for it all,  thought Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "But what s to be done?",
      "What s to be done?",
      "he said to himself in\ndespair, and found no answer.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself.",
      "He was incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he\nrepented of his conduct.",
      "He could not at this date repent of the fact\nthat he, a handsome, susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love\nwith his wife, the mother of five living and two dead children, and\nonly a year younger than himself.",
      "All he repented of was that he had\nnot succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.",
      "But he felt all the\ndifficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his children,\nand himself.",
      "Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better\nfrom his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would\nhave had such an effect on her.",
      "He had never clearly thought out the\nsubject, but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have\nsuspected him of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the\nfact.",
      "He had even supposed that she, a worn-out woman no longer young\nor good-looking, and in no way remarkable or interesting, merely a good\nmother, ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view.",
      "It\nhad turned out quite the other way.",
      "Oh, it s awful!",
      "oh dear, oh dear!",
      "awful!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch kept\nrepeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be done.",
      "And\nhow well things were going up till now!",
      "how well we got on!",
      "She was\ncontented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in\nanything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she\nliked.",
      "It s true it s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.",
      "That s bad!",
      "There s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one s\ngoverness.",
      "But what a governess!",
      "(He vividly recalled the roguish\nblack eyes of Mlle.",
      "Roland and her smile.)",
      "But after all, while she\nwas in the house, I kept myself in hand.",
      "And the worst of it all is\nthat she s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so!",
      "Oh,\noh!",
      "But what, what is to be done?",
      "There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to\nall questions, even the most complex and insoluble.",
      "That answer is: one\nmust live in the needs of the day that is, forget oneself.",
      "To forget\nhimself in sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could\nnot go back now to the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must\nforget himself in the dream of daily life.",
      "Then we shall see,  Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting\nup he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the\ntassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad,\nbare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step,\nturning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily.",
      "He pulled\nup the blind and rang the bell loudly.",
      "It was at once answered by the\nappearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes,\nhis boots, and a telegram.",
      "Matvey was followed by the barber with all\nthe necessaries for shaving.",
      "Are there any papers from the office?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,\ntaking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.",
      "On the table,  replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his\nmaster; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile,  They ve\nsent from the carriage-jobbers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the\nlooking-glass.",
      "In the glance, in which their eyes met in the\nlooking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch s eyes asked:  Why do you tell me that?",
      "don t you know?",
      "Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and\ngazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.",
      "I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or\nthemselves for nothing,  he said.",
      "He had obviously prepared the\nsentence beforehand.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract\nattention to himself.",
      "Tearing open the telegram, he read it through,\nguessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and\nhis face brightened.",
      "Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,  he said,\nchecking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a\npink path through his long, curly whiskers.",
      "Thank God!",
      "said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his\nmaster, realized the significance of this arrival that is, that Anna\nArkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a\nreconciliation between husband and wife.",
      "Alone, or with her husband?",
      "inquired Matvey.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his\nupper lip, and he raised one finger.",
      "Matvey nodded at the\nlooking-glass.",
      "Alone.",
      "Is the room to be got ready upstairs?",
      "Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna?",
      "Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.",
      "Yes, inform her.",
      "Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do\nwhat she tells you.",
      "You want to try it on,  Matvey understood, but he only said,  Yes,\nsir.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be\ndressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came\nback into the room with the telegram in his hand.",
      "The barber had gone.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away.",
      "Let\nhim do that is you as he likes,  he said, laughing only with his eyes,\nand putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his\nhead on one side.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute.",
      "Then a\ngood-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome\nface.",
      "Eh, Matvey?",
      "he said, shaking his head.",
      "It s all right, sir; she will come round,  said Matvey.",
      "Come round?",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "Do you think so?",
      "Who s there?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the\nrustle of a woman s dress at the door.",
      "It s I,  said a firm, pleasant, woman s voice, and the stern,\npockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at\nthe doorway.",
      "Well, what is it, Matrona?",
      "queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to\nher at the door.",
      "Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his\nwife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house\n(even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna s chief ally) was on his side.",
      "Well, what now?",
      "he asked disconsolately.",
      "Go to her, sir; own your fault again.",
      "Maybe God will aid you.",
      "She is\nsuffering so, it s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house\nis topsy-turvy.",
      "You must have pity, sir, on the children.",
      "Beg her\nforgiveness, sir.",
      "There s no help for it!",
      "One must take the\nconsequences....",
      "But she won t see me.",
      "You do your part.",
      "God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.",
      "Come, that ll do, you can go,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, blushing\nsuddenly.",
      "Well now, do dress me.",
      "He turned to Matvey and threw off\nhis dressing-gown decisively.",
      "Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse s collar, and,\nblowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure\nover the well-groomed body of his master.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nWhen he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on\nhimself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his\ncigarettes, pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and\nseals, and shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean,\nfragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his unhappiness,\nhe walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining-room, where\ncoffee was already waiting for him, and beside the coffee, letters and\npapers from the office.",
      "He read the letters.",
      "One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was\nbuying a forest on his wife s property.",
      "To sell this forest was\nabsolutely essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his\nwife, the subject could not be discussed.",
      "The most unpleasant thing of\nall was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the\nquestion of his reconciliation with his wife.",
      "And the idea that he\nmight be led on by his interests, that he might seek a reconciliation\nwith his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him.",
      "When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the\noffice-papers close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of\nbusiness, made a few notes with a big pencil, and pushing away the\npapers, turned to his coffee.",
      "As he sipped his coffee, he opened a\nstill damp morning paper, and began reading it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme\none, but one advocating the views held by the majority.",
      "And in spite of\nthe fact that science, art, and politics had no special interest for\nhim, he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held\nby the majority and by his paper, and he only changed them when the\nmajority changed them or, more strictly speaking, he did not change\nthem, but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views;\nthese political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just\nas he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took\nthose that were being worn.",
      "And for him, living in a certain\nsociety owing to the need, ordinarily developed at years of discretion,\nfor some degree of mental activity to have views was just as\nindispensable as to have a hat.",
      "If there was a reason for his\npreferring liberal to conservative views, which were held also by many\nof his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism more\nrational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of\nlife.",
      "The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and\ncertainly Stepan Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of\nmoney.",
      "The liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out\nof date, and that it needs reconstruction; and family life certainly\nafforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little gratification, and forced him into\nlying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive to his nature.",
      "The liberal\nparty said, or rather allowed it to be understood, that religion is\nonly a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people; and\nStepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without\nhis legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the\nobject of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world\nwhen life might be so very amusing in this world.",
      "And with all this,\nStepan Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man\nby saying that if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop\nat Rurik and disown the first founder of his family the monkey.",
      "And so\nLiberalism had become a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch s, and he liked\nhis newspaper, as he did his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it\ndiffused in his brain.",
      "He read the leading article, in which it was\nmaintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry\nthat radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative\nelements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush the\nrevolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary,  in our opinion the danger\nlies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of\ntraditionalism clogging progress,  etc., etc.",
      "He read another article,\ntoo, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped\nsome innuendoes reflecting on the ministry.",
      "With his characteristic\nquickwittedness he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it\ncame, at whom and on what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him,\nas it always did, a certain satisfaction.",
      "But today that satisfaction\nwas embittered by Matrona Philimonovna s advice and the unsatisfactory\nstate of the household.",
      "He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to\nhave left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and\nof the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a\nsituation; but these items of information did not give him, as usual, a\nquiet, ironical gratification.",
      "Having finished the paper, a second cup\nof coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of the\nroll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled\njoyously: not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his\nmind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.",
      "But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew\nthoughtful.",
      "Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of\nGrisha, his youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard\noutside the door.",
      "They were carrying something, and dropped it.",
      "I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,  said the little girl in\nEnglish;  there, pick them up!",
      "Everything s in confusion,  thought Stepan Arkadyevitch;  there are\nthe children running about by themselves.",
      "And going to the door, he\ncalled them.",
      "They threw down the box, that represented a train, and\ncame in to their father.",
      "The little girl, her father s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him,\nand hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell\nof scent that came from his whiskers.",
      "At last the little girl kissed\nhis face, which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with\ntenderness, loosed her hands, and was about to run away again; but her\nfather held her back.",
      "How is mamma?",
      "he asked, passing his hand over his daughter s smooth,\nsoft little neck.",
      "Good morning,  he said, smiling to the boy, who had\ncome up to greet him.",
      "He was conscious that he loved the boy less, and\nalways tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did not respond with\na smile to his father s chilly smile.",
      "Mamma?",
      "She is up,  answered the girl.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed.",
      "That means that she s not slept again all\nnight,  he thought.",
      "Well, is she cheerful?",
      "The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and\nmother, and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father\nmust be aware of this, and that he was pretending when he asked about\nit so lightly.",
      "And she blushed for her father.",
      "He at once perceived it,\nand blushed too.",
      "I don t know,  she said.",
      "She did not say we must do our lessons, but\nshe said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma s. \n\n Well, go, Tanya, my darling.",
      "Oh, wait a minute, though,  he said,\nstill holding her and stroking her soft little hand.",
      "He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little\nbox of sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate\nand a fondant.",
      "For Grisha?",
      "said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.",
      "Yes, yes.",
      "And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her on\nthe roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.",
      "The carriage is ready,  said Matvey;  but there s someone to see you\nwith a petition.",
      "Been here long?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Half an hour.",
      "How many times have I told you to tell me at once?",
      "One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,  said Matvey,\nin the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be\nangry.",
      "Well, show the person up at once,  said Oblonsky, frowning with\nvexation.",
      "The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a\nrequest impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he\ngenerally did, made her sit down, heard her to the end attentively\nwithout interrupting her, and gave her detailed advice as to how and to\nwhom to apply, and even wrote her, in his large, sprawling, good and\nlegible hand, a confident and fluent little note to a personage who\nmight be of use to her.",
      "Having got rid of the staff captain s widow,\nStepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he\nhad forgotten anything.",
      "It appeared that he had forgotten nothing\nexcept what he wanted to forget his wife.",
      "Ah, yes!",
      "He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a harassed\nexpression.",
      "To go, or not to go!",
      "he said to himself; and an inner\nvoice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but\nfalsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible,\nbecause it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to\ninspire love, or to make him an old man, not susceptible to love.",
      "Except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now; and deceit and\nlying were opposed to his nature.",
      "It must be some time, though: it can t go on like this,  he said,\ntrying to give himself courage.",
      "He squared his chest, took out a\ncigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl\nashtray, and with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and\nopened the other door into his wife s bedroom.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nDarya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once\nluxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of\nher neck, with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which\nlooked prominent from the thinness of her face, was standing among a\nlitter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an\nopen bureau, from which she was taking something.",
      "Hearing her husband s\nsteps, she stopped, looking towards the door, and trying assiduously to\ngive her features a severe and contemptuous expression.",
      "She felt she\nwas afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview.",
      "She was just\nattempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in\nthese last three days to sort out the children s things and her own, so\nas to take them to her mother s and again she could not bring herself\nto do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying to\nherself,  that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some\nstep  to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part\nat least of the suffering he had caused her.",
      "She still continued to\ntell herself that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this\nwas impossible; it was impossible because she could not get out of the\nhabit of regarding him as her husband and loving him.",
      "Besides this, she\nrealized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to\nlook after her five children properly, they would be still worse off\nwhere she was going with them all.",
      "As it was, even in the course of\nthese three days, the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome\nsoup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day\nbefore.",
      "She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but,\ncheating herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and\npretending she was going.",
      "Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau\nas though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he\nhad come quite up to her.",
      "But her face, to which she tried to give a\nsevere and resolute expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.",
      "Dolly!",
      "he said in a subdued and timid voice.",
      "He bent his head towards\nhis shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he\nwas radiant with freshness and health.",
      "In a rapid glance she scanned\nhis figure that beamed with health and freshness.",
      "Yes, he is happy and\ncontent!",
      "she thought;  while I.... And that disgusting good nature,\nwhich everyone likes him for and praises I hate that good nature of\nhis,  she thought.",
      "Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek\ncontracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.",
      "What do you want?",
      "she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.",
      "Dolly!",
      "he repeated, with a quiver in his voice.",
      "Anna is coming\ntoday.",
      "Well, what is that to me?",
      "I can t see her!",
      "she cried.",
      "But you must, really, Dolly.... \n\n Go away, go away, go away!",
      "she shrieked, not looking at him, as\nthough this shriek were called up by physical pain.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could\nhope that she would _come round_, as Matvey expressed it, and could\nquietly go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he\nsaw her tortured, suffering face, heard the tone of her voice,\nsubmissive to fate and full of despair, there was a catch in his breath\nand a lump in his throat, and his eyes began to shine with tears.",
      "My God!",
      "what have I done?",
      "Dolly!",
      "For God s sake!...",
      "You know....",
      "He\ncould not go on; there was a sob in his throat.",
      "She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.",
      "Dolly, what can I say?...",
      "One thing: forgive....",
      "Remember, cannot nine\nyears of my life atone for an instant.... \n\nShe dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it\nwere beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe\ndifferently.",
      "instant of passion?",
      "he said, and would have gone on, but at that\nword, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and\nagain the muscles of her right cheek worked.",
      "Go away, go out of the room!",
      "she shrieked still more shrilly,  and\ndon t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.",
      "She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to\nsupport herself.",
      "His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were\nswimming with tears.",
      "Dolly!",
      "he said, sobbing now;  for mercy s sake, think of the\nchildren; they are not to blame!",
      "I am to blame, and punish me, make me\nexpiate my fault.",
      "Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything!",
      "I am to\nblame, no words can express how much I am to blame!",
      "But, Dolly, forgive\nme!",
      "She sat down.",
      "He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was\nunutterably sorry for her.",
      "She tried several times to begin to speak,\nbut could not.",
      "He waited.",
      "You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember\nthem, and know that this means their ruin,  she said obviously one of\nthe phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of\nthe last few days.",
      "She had called him  Stiva,  and he glanced at her with gratitude, and\nmoved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.",
      "I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in\nthe world to save them, but I don t myself know how to save them.",
      "By\ntaking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious\nfather yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened,\ncan we live together?",
      "Is that possible?",
      "Tell me, eh, is it possible?",
      "she repeated, raising her voice,  after my husband, the father of my\nchildren, enters into a love affair with his own children s governess?",
      "But what could I do?",
      "what could I do?",
      "he kept saying in a pitiful\nvoice, not knowing what he was saying, as his head sank lower and\nlower.",
      "You are loathsome to me, repulsive!",
      "she shrieked, getting more and\nmore heated.",
      "Your tears mean nothing!",
      "You have never loved me; you\nhave neither heart nor honorable feeling!",
      "You are hateful to me,\ndisgusting, a stranger yes, a complete stranger!",
      "With pain and wrath\nshe uttered the word so terrible to herself _stranger_.",
      "He looked at her, and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed\nhim.",
      "He did not understand how his pity for her exasperated her.",
      "She\nsaw in him sympathy for her, but not love.",
      "No, she hates me.",
      "She will\nnot forgive me,  he thought.",
      "It is awful!",
      "awful!",
      "he said.",
      "At that moment in the next room a child began to cry; probably it had\nfallen down.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face suddenly\nsoftened.",
      "She seemed to be pulling herself together for a few seconds, as though\nshe did not know where she was, and what she was doing, and getting up\nrapidly, she moved towards the door.",
      "Well, she loves my child,  he thought, noticing the change of her face\nat the child s cry,  my child: how can she hate me?",
      "Dolly, one word more,  he said, following her.",
      "If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children!",
      "They\nmay all know you are a scoundrel!",
      "I am going away at once, and you may\nlive here with your mistress!",
      "And she went out, slamming the door.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed, wiped his face, and with a subdued tread\nwalked out of the room.",
      "Matvey says she will come round; but how?",
      "I\ndon t see the least chance of it.",
      "Ah, oh, how horrible it is!",
      "And how\nvulgarly she shouted,  he said to himself, remembering her shriek and\nthe words scoundrel  and  mistress.",
      "And very likely the maids were\nlistening!",
      "Horribly vulgar!",
      "horrible!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch stood a few\nseconds alone, wiped his face, squared his chest, and walked out of the\nroom.",
      "It was Friday, and in the dining-room the German watchmaker was winding\nup the clock.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch remembered his joke about this\npunctual, bald watchmaker,  that the German was wound up for a whole\nlifetime himself, to wind up watches,  and he smiled.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch was fond of a joke:  And maybe she will come round!",
      "That s\na good expression,  _come round,_  he thought.",
      "I must repeat that.",
      "Matvey!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting\nroom for Anna Arkadyevna,  he said to Matvey when he came in.",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch put on his fur coat and went out onto the steps.",
      "You won t dine at home?",
      "said Matvey, seeing him off.",
      "That s as it happens.",
      "But here s for the housekeeping,  he said,\ntaking ten roubles from his pocketbook.",
      "That ll be enough.",
      "Enough or not enough, we must make it do,  said Matvey, slamming the\ncarriage door and stepping back onto the steps.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child, and knowing\nfrom the sound of the carriage that he had gone off, went back again to\nher bedroom.",
      "It was her solitary refuge from the household cares which\ncrowded upon her directly she went out from it.",
      "Even now, in the short\ntime she had been in the nursery, the English governess and Matrona\nPhilimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her, which\ndid not admit of delay, and which only she could answer:  What were the\nchildren to put on for their walk?",
      "Should they have any milk?",
      "Should\nnot a new cook be sent for?",
      "Ah, let me alone, let me alone!",
      "she said, and going back to her\nbedroom she sat down in the same place as she had sat when talking to\nher husband, clasping tightly her thin hands with the rings that\nslipped down on her bony fingers, and fell to going over in her memory\nall the conversation.",
      "He has gone!",
      "But has he broken it off with her?",
      "she thought.",
      "Can it be he sees her?",
      "Why didn t I ask him!",
      "No, no,\nreconciliation is impossible.",
      "Even if we remain in the same house, we\nare strangers strangers forever!",
      "She repeated again with special\nsignificance the word so dreadful to her.",
      "And how I loved him!",
      "my God,\nhow I loved him!...",
      "How I loved him!",
      "And now don t I love him?",
      "Don t I\nlove him more than before?",
      "The most horrible thing is,  she began, but\ndid not finish her thought, because Matrona Philimonovna put her head\nin at the door.",
      "Let us send for my brother,  she said;  he can get a dinner anyway, or\nwe shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like\nyesterday.",
      "Very well, I will come directly and see about it.",
      "But did you send for\nsome new milk?",
      "And Darya Alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day, and drowned\nher grief in them for a time.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, thanks to his\nexcellent abilities, but he had been idle and mischievous, and\ntherefore was one of the lowest in his class.",
      "But in spite of his\nhabitually dissipated mode of life, his inferior grade in the service,\nand his comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative\nposition of president of one of the government boards at Moscow.",
      "This\npost he had received through his sister Anna s husband, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch Karenin, who held one of the most important positions in\nthe ministry to whose department the Moscow office belonged.",
      "But if\nKarenin had not got his brother-in-law this berth, then through a\nhundred other personages brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and\naunts Stiva Oblonsky would have received this post, or some other\nsimilar one, together with the salary of six thousand absolutely\nneedful for him, as his affairs, in spite of his wife s considerable\nproperty, were in an embarrassed condition.",
      "Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations of Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "He was born in the midst of those who had been and are\nthe powerful ones of this world.",
      "One-third of the men in the\ngovernment, the older men, had been friends of his father s, and had\nknown him in petticoats; another third were his intimate chums, and the\nremainder were friendly acquaintances.",
      "Consequently the distributors of\nearthly blessings in the shape of places, rents, shares, and such, were\nall his friends, and could not overlook one of their own set; and\nOblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative\npost.",
      "He had only not to refuse things, not to show jealousy, not to be\nquarrelsome or take offense, all of which from his characteristic good\nnature he never did.",
      "It would have struck him as absurd if he had been\ntold that he would not get a position with the salary he required,\nespecially as he expected nothing out of the way; he only wanted what\nthe men of his own age and standing did get, and he was no worse\nqualified for performing duties of the kind than any other man.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his\ngood humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable\nhonesty.",
      "In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes,\nblack hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was\nsomething which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor\non the people who met him.",
      "Aha!",
      "Stiva!",
      "Oblonsky!",
      "Here he is!",
      "was\nalmost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him.",
      "Even though\nit happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that\nnothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the\nnext, everyone was just as delighted at meeting him again.",
      "After filling for three years the post of president of one of the\ngovernment boards at Moscow, Stepan Arkadyevitch had won the respect,\nas well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, and\nsuperiors, and all who had had business with him.",
      "The principal\nqualities in Stepan Arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal\nrespect in the service consisted, in the first place, of his extreme\nindulgence for others, founded on a consciousness of his own\nshortcomings; secondly, of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he\nread of in the papers, but the liberalism that was in his blood, in\nvirtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the\nsame, whatever their fortune or calling might be; and thirdly the most\nimportant point his complete indifference to the business in which he\nwas engaged, in consequence of which he was never carried away, and\nnever made mistakes.",
      "On reaching the offices of the board, Stepan Arkadyevitch, escorted by\na deferential porter with a portfolio, went into his little private\nroom, put on his uniform, and went into the boardroom.",
      "The clerks and\ncopyists all rose, greeting him with good-humored deference.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch moved quickly, as ever, to his place, shook hands with his\ncolleagues, and sat down.",
      "He made a joke or two, and talked just as\nmuch as was consistent with due decorum, and began work.",
      "No one knew\nbetter than Stepan Arkadyevitch how to hit on the exact line between\nfreedom, simplicity, and official stiffness necessary for the agreeable\nconduct of business.",
      "A secretary, with the good-humored deference\ncommon to everyone in Stepan Arkadyevitch s office, came up with\npapers, and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been\nintroduced by Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "We have succeeded in getting the information from the government\ndepartment of Penza.",
      "Here, would you care?...",
      "You ve got them at last?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laying his finger\non the paper.",
      "Now, gentlemen.... \n\nAnd the sitting of the board began.",
      "If they knew,  he thought, bending his head with a significant air as\nhe listened to the report,  what a guilty little boy their president\nwas half an hour ago.",
      "And his eyes were laughing during the reading of\nthe report.",
      "Till two o clock the sitting would go on without a break,\nand at two o clock there would be an interval and luncheon.",
      "It was not yet two, when the large glass doors of the boardroom\nsuddenly opened and someone came in.",
      "All the officials sitting on the further side under the portrait of the\nTsar and the eagle, delighted at any distraction, looked round at the\ndoor; but the doorkeeper standing at the door at once drove out the\nintruder, and closed the glass door after him.",
      "When the case had been read through, Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and\nstretched, and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took\nout a cigarette in the boardroom and went into his private room.",
      "Two of\nthe members of the board, the old veteran in the service, Nikitin, and\nthe _Kammerjunker_ Grinevitch, went in with him.",
      "We shall have time to finish after lunch,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "To be sure we shall!",
      "said Nikitin.",
      "A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,  said Grinevitch of one of\nthe persons taking part in the case they were examining.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch frowned at Grinevitch s words, giving him thereby\nto understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely, and\nmade him no reply.",
      "Who was that came in?",
      "he asked the doorkeeper.",
      "Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back\nwas turned.",
      "He was asking for you.",
      "I told him: when the members come\nout, then.... \n\n Where is he?",
      "Maybe he s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway.",
      "That is\nhe,  said the doorkeeper, pointing to a strongly built,\nbroad-shouldered man with a curly beard, who, without taking off his\nsheepskin cap, was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the\nstone staircase.",
      "One of the members going down a lean official with a\nportfolio stood out of his way and looked disapprovingly at the legs of\nthe stranger, then glanced inquiringly at Oblonsky.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was standing at the top of the stairs.",
      "His\ngood-naturedly beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform\nbeamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up.",
      "Why, it s actually you, Levin, at last!",
      "he said with a friendly\nmocking smile, scanning Levin as he approached.",
      "How is it you have\ndeigned to look me up in this den?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and not\ncontent with shaking hands, he kissed his friend.",
      "Have you been here\nlong?",
      "I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,  said Levin,\nlooking shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily around.",
      "Well, let s go into my room,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who knew his\nfriend s sensitive and irritable shyness, and, taking his arm, he drew\nhim along, as though guiding him through dangers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his\nacquaintances, and called almost all of them by their Christian names:\nold men of sixty, boys of twenty, actors, ministers, merchants, and\nadjutant-generals, so that many of his intimate chums were to be found\nat the extreme ends of the social ladder, and would have been very much\nsurprised to learn that they had, through the medium of Oblonsky,\nsomething in common.",
      "He was the familiar friend of everyone with whom\nhe took a glass of champagne, and he took a glass of champagne with\neveryone, and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums,\nas he used in joke to call many of his friends, in the presence of his\nsubordinates, he well knew how, with his characteristic tact, to\ndiminish the disagreeable impression made on them.",
      "Levin was not a\ndisreputable chum, but Oblonsky, with his ready tact, felt that Levin\nfancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his\nsubordinates, and so he made haste to take him off into his room.",
      "Levin was almost of the same age as Oblonsky; their intimacy did not\nrest merely on champagne.",
      "Levin had been the friend and companion of\nhis early youth.",
      "They were fond of one another in spite of the\ndifference of their characters and tastes, as friends are fond of one\nanother who have been together in early youth.",
      "But in spite of this,\neach of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of\ndifferent kinds though in discussion he would even justify the other s\ncareer, in his heart despised it.",
      "It seemed to each of them that the\nlife he led himself was the only real life, and the life led by his\nfriend was a mere phantasm.",
      "Oblonsky could not restrain a slight\nmocking smile at the sight of Levin.",
      "How often he had seen him come up\nto Moscow from the country where he was doing something, but what\nprecisely Stepan Arkadyevitch could never quite make out, and indeed he\ntook no interest in the matter.",
      "Levin arrived in Moscow always excited\nand in a hurry, rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of\nease, and for the most part with a perfectly new, unexpected view of\nthings.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed at this, and liked it.",
      "In the same\nway Levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend,\nand his official duties, which he laughed at, and regarded as trifling.",
      "But the difference was that Oblonsky, as he was doing the same as\neveryone did, laughed complacently and good-humoredly, while Levin\nlaughed without complacency and sometimes angrily.",
      "We have long been expecting you,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going into\nhis room and letting Levin s hand go as though to show that here all\ndanger was over.",
      "I am very, very glad to see you,  he went on.",
      "Well,\nhow are you?",
      "Eh?",
      "When did you come?",
      "Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky s two\ncompanions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which\nhad such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and\nsuch huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they\nabsorbed all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought.",
      "Oblonsky noticed this at once, and smiled.",
      "Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,  he said.",
      "My colleagues: Philip\nIvanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch and turning to\nLevin a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast\nwho lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman,\nand my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey\nIvanovitch Koznishev.",
      "Delighted,  said the veteran.",
      "I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,  said\nGrinevitch, holding out his slender hand with its long nails.",
      "Levin frowned, shook hands coldly, and at once turned to Oblonsky.",
      "Though he had a great respect for his half-brother, an author well\nknown to all Russia, he could not endure it when people treated him not\nas Konstantin Levin, but as the brother of the celebrated Koznishev.",
      "No, I am no longer a district councilor.",
      "I have quarreled with them\nall, and don t go to the meetings any more,  he said, turning to\nOblonsky.",
      "You ve been quick about it!",
      "said Oblonsky with a smile.",
      "But how?",
      "why?",
      "It s a long story.",
      "I will tell you some time,  said Levin, but he\nbegan telling him at once.",
      "Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced\nthat nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could\nbe,  he began, as though someone had just insulted him.",
      "On one side\nit s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I m neither\nyoung enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the\nother side  (he stammered)  it s a means for the coterie of the\ndistrict to make money.",
      "Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice,\nnow they have the district council not in the form of bribes, but in\nthe form of unearned salary,  he said, as hotly as though someone of\nthose present had opposed his opinion.",
      "Aha!",
      "You re in a new phase again, I see a conservative,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "However, we can go into that later.",
      "Yes, later.",
      "But I wanted to see you,  said Levin, looking with hatred\nat Grinevitch s hand.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile.",
      "How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?",
      "he said, scanning his new suit, obviously cut by a French tailor.",
      "Ah!",
      "I see: a new phase.",
      "Levin suddenly blushed, not as grown men blush, slightly, without being\nthemselves aware of it, but as boys blush, feeling that they are\nridiculous through their shyness, and consequently ashamed of it and\nblushing still more, almost to the point of tears.",
      "And it was so\nstrange to see this sensible, manly face in such a childish plight,\nthat Oblonsky left off looking at him.",
      "Oh, where shall we meet?",
      "You know I want very much to talk to you, \nsaid Levin.",
      "Oblonsky seemed to ponder.",
      "I ll tell you what: let s go to Gurin s to lunch, and there we can\ntalk.",
      "I am free till three.",
      "No,  answered Levin, after an instant s thought,  I have got to go on\nsomewhere else.",
      "All right, then, let s dine together.",
      "Dine together?",
      "But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to\nsay, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk\nafterwards.",
      "Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we ll gossip after\ndinner.",
      "Well, it s this,  said Levin;  but it s of no importance, though.",
      "His face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was\nmaking to surmount his shyness.",
      "What are the Shtcherbatskys doing?",
      "Everything as it used to be?",
      "he\nsaid.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had long known that Levin was in love with his\nsister-in-law, Kitty, gave a hardly perceptible smile, and his eyes\nsparkled merrily.",
      "You said a few words, but I can t answer in a few words, because....",
      "Excuse me a minute.... \n\nA secretary came in, with respectful familiarity and the modest\nconsciousness, characteristic of every secretary, of superiority to his\nchief in the knowledge of their business; he went up to Oblonsky with\nsome papers, and began, under pretense of asking a question, to explain\nsome objection.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, without hearing him out, laid his\nhand genially on the secretary s sleeve.",
      "No, you do as I told you,  he said, softening his words with a smile,\nand with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away\nfrom the papers, and said:  So do it that way, if you please, Zahar\nNikititch.",
      "The secretary retired in confusion.",
      "During the consultation with the\nsecretary Levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment.",
      "He was\nstanding with his elbows on the back of a chair, and on his face was a\nlook of ironical attention.",
      "I don t understand it, I don t understand it,  he said.",
      "What don t you understand?",
      "said Oblonsky, smiling as brightly as\never, and picking up a cigarette.",
      "He expected some queer outburst from\nLevin.",
      "I don t understand what you are doing,  said Levin, shrugging his\nshoulders.",
      "How can you do it seriously?",
      "Why not?",
      "Why, because there s nothing in it.",
      "You think so, but we re overwhelmed with work.",
      "On paper.",
      "But, there, you ve a gift for it,  added Levin.",
      "That s to say, you think there s a lack of something in me?",
      "Perhaps so,  said Levin.",
      "But all the same I admire your grandeur, and\nam proud that I ve a friend in such a great person.",
      "You ve not answered\nmy question, though,  he went on, with a desperate effort looking\nOblonsky straight in the face.",
      "Oh, that s all very well.",
      "You wait a bit, and you ll come to this\nyourself.",
      "It s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the\nKarazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of\ntwelve; still you ll be one of us one day.",
      "Yes, as to your question,\nthere is no change, but it s a pity you ve been away so long.",
      "Oh, why so?",
      "Levin queried, panic-stricken.",
      "Oh, nothing,  responded Oblonsky.",
      "We ll talk it over.",
      "But what s\nbrought you up to town?",
      "Oh, we ll talk about that, too, later on,  said Levin, reddening again\nup to his ears.",
      "All right.",
      "I see,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I should ask you to come\nto us, you know, but my wife s not quite the thing.",
      "But I tell you\nwhat; if you want to see them, they re sure now to be at the Zoological\nGardens from four to five.",
      "Kitty skates.",
      "You drive along there, and\nI ll come and fetch you, and we ll go and dine somewhere together.",
      "Capital.",
      "So good-bye till then.",
      "Now mind, you ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch called out laughing.",
      "No, truly!",
      "And Levin went out of the room, only when he was in the doorway\nremembering that he had forgotten to take leave of Oblonsky s\ncolleagues.",
      "That gentleman must be a man of great energy,  said Grinevitch, when\nLevin had gone away.",
      "Yes, my dear boy,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, nodding his head,  he s a\nlucky fellow!",
      "Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district;\neverything before him; and what youth and vigor!",
      "Not like some of us.",
      "You have a great deal to complain of, haven t you, Stepan\nArkadyevitch?",
      "Ah, yes, I m in a poor way, a bad way,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch with\na heavy sigh.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nWhen Oblonsky asked Levin what had brought him to town, Levin blushed,\nand was furious with himself for blushing, because he could not answer,\n I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,  though that was\nprecisely what he had come for.",
      "The families of the Levins and the Shtcherbatskys were old, noble\nMoscow families, and had always been on intimate and friendly terms.",
      "This intimacy had grown still closer during Levin s student days.",
      "He\nhad both prepared for the university with the young Prince\nShtcherbatsky, the brother of Kitty and Dolly, and had entered at the\nsame time with him.",
      "In those days Levin used often to be in the\nShtcherbatskys  house, and he was in love with the Shtcherbatsky\nhousehold.",
      "Strange as it may appear, it was with the household, the\nfamily, that Konstantin Levin was in love, especially with the feminine\nhalf of the household.",
      "Levin did not remember his own mother, and his\nonly sister was older than he was, so that it was in the\nShtcherbatskys  house that he saw for the first time that inner life of\nan old, noble, cultivated, and honorable family of which he had been\ndeprived by the death of his father and mother.",
      "All the members of that\nfamily, especially the feminine half, were pictured by him, as it were,\nwrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil, and he not only\nperceived no defects whatever in them, but under the poetical veil that\nshrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and\nevery possible perfection.",
      "Why it was the three young ladies had one\nday to speak French, and the next English; why it was that at certain\nhours they played by turns on the piano, the sounds of which were\naudible in their brother s room above, where the students used to work;\nwhy they were visited by those professors of French literature, of\nmusic, of drawing, of dancing; why at certain hours all the three young\nladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky\nboulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia\nin a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in\ntightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders; why it was\nthey had to walk about the Tversky boulevard escorted by a footman with\na gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their\nmysterious world he did not understand, but he was sure that everything\nthat was done there was very good, and he was in love precisely with\nthe mystery of the proceedings.",
      "In his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest, Dolly,\nbut she was soon married to Oblonsky.",
      "Then he began being in love with\nthe second.",
      "He felt, as it were, that he had to be in love with one of\nthe sisters, only he could not quite make out which.",
      "But Natalia, too,\nhad hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the\ndiplomat Lvov.",
      "Kitty was still a child when Levin left the university.",
      "Young Shtcherbatsky went into the navy, was drowned in the Baltic, and\nLevin s relations with the Shtcherbatskys, in spite of his friendship\nwith Oblonsky, became less intimate.",
      "But when early in the winter of\nthis year Levin came to Moscow, after a year in the country, and saw\nthe Shtcherbatskys, he realized which of the three sisters he was\nindeed destined to love.",
      "One would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him, a\nman of good family, rather rich than poor, and thirty-two years old, to\nmake the young Princess Shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage; in all\nlikelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match.",
      "But\nLevin was in love, and so it seemed to him that Kitty was so perfect in\nevery respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly; and\nthat he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be\nconceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy\nof her.",
      "After spending two months in Moscow in a state of enchantment, seeing\nKitty almost every day in society, into which he went so as to meet\nher, he abruptly decided that it could not be, and went back to the\ncountry.",
      "Levin s conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in\nthe eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for\nthe charming Kitty, and that Kitty herself could not love him.",
      "In her\nfamily s eyes he had no ordinary, definite career and position in\nsociety, while his contemporaries by this time, when he was thirty-two,\nwere already, one a colonel, and another a professor, another director\nof a bank and railways, or president of a board like Oblonsky.",
      "But he\n(he knew very well how he must appear to others) was a country\ngentleman, occupied in breeding cattle, shooting game, and building\nbarns; in other words, a fellow of no ability, who had not turned out\nwell, and who was doing just what, according to the ideas of the world,\nis done by people fit for nothing else.",
      "The mysterious, enchanting Kitty herself could not love such an ugly\nperson as he conceived himself to be, and, above all, such an ordinary,\nin no way striking person.",
      "Moreover, his attitude to Kitty in the\npast the attitude of a grown-up person to a child, arising from his\nfriendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love.",
      "An ugly, good-natured man, as he considered himself, might, he\nsupposed, be liked as a friend; but to be loved with such a love as\nthat with which he loved Kitty, one would need to be a handsome and,\nstill more, a distinguished man.",
      "He had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men, but\nhe did not believe it, for he judged by himself, and he could not\nhimself have loved any but beautiful, mysterious, and exceptional\nwomen.",
      "But after spending two months alone in the country, he was convinced\nthat this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience\nin his early youth; that this feeling gave him not an instant s rest;\nthat he could not live without deciding the question, would she or\nwould she not be his wife, and that his despair had arisen only from\nhis own imaginings, that he had no sort of proof that he would be\nrejected.",
      "And he had now come to Moscow with a firm determination to\nmake an offer, and get married if he were accepted.",
      "Or ... he could not\nconceive what would become of him if he were rejected.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nOn arriving in Moscow by a morning train, Levin had put up at the house\nof his elder half-brother, Koznishev.",
      "After changing his clothes he\nwent down to his brother s study, intending to talk to him at once\nabout the object of his visit, and to ask his advice; but his brother\nwas not alone.",
      "With him there was a well-known professor of philosophy,\nwho had come from Harkov expressly to clear up a difference that had\narisen between them on a very important philosophical question.",
      "The\nprofessor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists.",
      "Sergey\nKoznishev had been following this crusade with interest, and after\nreading the professor s last article, he had written him a letter\nstating his objections.",
      "He accused the professor of making too great\nconcessions to the materialists.",
      "And the professor had promptly\nappeared to argue the matter out.",
      "The point in discussion was the\nquestion then in vogue: Is there a line to be drawn between\npsychological and physiological phenomena in man?",
      "and if so, where?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness\nhe always had for everyone, and introducing him to the professor, went\non with the conversation.",
      "A little man in spectacles, with a narrow forehead, tore himself from\nthe discussion for an instant to greet Levin, and then went on talking\nwithout paying any further attention to him.",
      "Levin sat down to wait\ntill the professor should go, but he soon began to get interested in\nthe subject under discussion.",
      "Levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were\ndisputing, and had read them, interested in them as a development of\nthe first principles of science, familiar to him as a natural science\nstudent at the university.",
      "But he had never connected these scientific\ndeductions as to the origin of man as an animal, as to reflex action,\nbiology, and sociology, with those questions as to the meaning of life\nand death to himself, which had of late been more and more often in his\nmind.",
      "As he listened to his brother s argument with the professor, he noticed\nthat they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual\nproblems, that at times they almost touched on the latter; but every\ntime they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point, they\npromptly beat a hasty retreat, and plunged again into a sea of subtle\ndistinctions, reservations, quotations, allusions, and appeals to\nauthorities, and it was with difficulty that he understood what they\nwere talking about.",
      "I cannot admit it,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, with his habitual\nclearness, precision of expression, and elegance of phrase.",
      "I cannot\nin any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external\nworld has been derived from perceptions.",
      "The most fundamental idea, the\nidea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation;\nindeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an\nidea.",
      "Yes, but they Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov would answer that your\nconsciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your\nsensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your\nsensations.",
      "Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no\nsensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.",
      "I maintain the contrary,  began Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But here it seemed to Levin that just as they were close upon the real\npoint of the matter, they were again retreating, and he made up his\nmind to put a question to the professor.",
      "According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I\ncan have no existence of any sort?",
      "he queried.",
      "The professor, in annoyance, and, as it were, mental suffering at the\ninterruption, looked round at the strange inquirer, more like a\nbargeman than a philosopher, and turned his eyes upon Sergey\nIvanovitch, as though to ask: What s one to say to him?",
      "But Sergey\nIvanovitch, who had been talking with far less heat and one-sidedness\nthan the professor, and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer\nthe professor, and at the same time to comprehend the simple and\nnatural point of view from which the question was put, smiled and said:\n\n That question we have no right to answer as yet.",
      "We have not the requisite data,  chimed in the professor, and he went\nback to his argument.",
      "No,  he said;  I would point out the fact that\nif, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation,\nthen we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two\nconceptions.",
      "Levin listened no more, and simply waited for the professor to go.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nWhen the professor had gone, Sergey Ivanovitch turned to his brother.",
      "Delighted that you ve come.",
      "For some time, is it?",
      "How s your farming\ngetting on?",
      "Levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming, and\nonly put the question in deference to him, and so he only told him\nabout the sale of his wheat and money matters.",
      "Levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get\nmarried, and to ask his advice; he had indeed firmly resolved to do so.",
      "But after seeing his brother, listening to his conversation with the\nprofessor, hearing afterwards the unconsciously patronizing tone in\nwhich his brother questioned him about agricultural matters (their\nmother s property had not been divided, and Levin took charge of both\ntheir shares), Levin felt that he could not for some reason begin to\ntalk to him of his intention of marrying.",
      "He felt that his brother\nwould not look at it as he would have wished him to.",
      "Well, how is your district council doing?",
      "asked Sergey Ivanovitch,\nwho was greatly interested in these local boards and attached great\nimportance to them.",
      "I really don t know.",
      "What!",
      "Why, surely you re a member of the board?",
      "No, I m not a member now; I ve resigned,  answered Levin,  and I no\nlonger attend the meetings.",
      "What a pity!",
      "commented Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.",
      "Levin in self-defense began to describe what took place in the meetings\nin his district.",
      "That s how it always is!",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.",
      "We\nRussians are always like that.",
      "Perhaps it s our strong point, really,\nthe faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we\ncomfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our\ntongues.",
      "All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to\nany other European people why, the Germans or the English would have\nworked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into\nridicule.",
      "But how can it be helped?",
      "said Levin penitently.",
      "It was my last\neffort.",
      "And I did try with all my soul.",
      "I can t. I m no good at it.",
      "It s not that you re no good at it,  said Sergey Ivanovitch;  it is\nthat you don t look at it as you should.",
      "Perhaps not,  Levin answered dejectedly.",
      "Oh!",
      "do you know brother Nikolay s turned up again?",
      "This brother Nikolay was the elder brother of Konstantin Levin, and\nhalf-brother of Sergey Ivanovitch; a man utterly ruined, who had\ndissipated the greater part of his fortune, was living in the strangest\nand lowest company, and had quarreled with his brothers.",
      "What did you say?",
      "Levin cried with horror.",
      "How do you know?",
      "Prokofy saw him in the street.",
      "Here in Moscow?",
      "Where is he?",
      "Do you know?",
      "Levin got up from his\nchair, as though on the point of starting off at once.",
      "I am sorry I told you,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, shaking his head at\nhis younger brother s excitement.",
      "I sent to find out where he is\nliving, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid.",
      "This is the\nanswer he sent me.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch took a note from under a paper-weight and handed\nit to his brother.",
      "Levin read in the queer, familiar handwriting:  I humbly beg you to\nleave me in peace.",
      "That s the only favor I ask of my gracious\nbrothers.",
      "Nikolay Levin.",
      "Levin read it, and without raising his head stood with the note in his\nhands opposite Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "There was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his\nunhappy brother for the time, and the consciousness that it would be\nbase to do so.",
      "He obviously wants to offend me,  pursued Sergey Ivanovitch;  but he\ncannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist\nhim, but I know it s impossible to do that.",
      "Yes, yes,  repeated Levin.",
      "I understand and appreciate your attitude\nto him; but I shall go and see him.",
      "If you want to, do; but I shouldn t advise it,  said Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he\nwill not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say\nyou would do better not to go.",
      "You can t do him any good; still, do as\nyou please.",
      "Very likely I can t do any good, but I feel especially at such a\nmoment but that s another thing I feel I could not be at peace.",
      "Well, that I don t understand,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "One thing I\ndo understand,  he added;  it s a lesson in humility.",
      "I have come to\nlook very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous\nsince brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he\ndid.... \n\n Oh, it s awful, awful!",
      "repeated Levin.",
      "After obtaining his brother s address from Sergey Ivanovitch s footman,\nLevin was on the point of setting off at once to see him, but on second\nthought he decided to put off his visit till the evening.",
      "The first\nthing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come\nto Moscow for.",
      "From his brother s Levin went to Oblonsky s office, and\non getting news of the Shtcherbatskys from him, he drove to the place\nwhere he had been told he might find Kitty.",
      "Chapter 9\n\nAt four o clock, conscious of his throbbing heart, Levin stepped out of\na hired sledge at the Zoological Gardens, and turned along the path to\nthe frozen mounds and the skating ground, knowing that he would\ncertainly find her there, as he had seen the Shtcherbatskys  carriage\nat the entrance.",
      "It was a bright, frosty day.",
      "Rows of carriages, sledges, drivers, and\npolicemen were standing in the approach.",
      "Crowds of well-dressed people,\nwith hats bright in the sun, swarmed about the entrance and along the\nwell-swept little paths between the little houses adorned with carving\nin the Russian style.",
      "The old curly birches of the gardens, all their\ntwigs laden with snow, looked as though freshly decked in sacred\nvestments.",
      "He walked along the path towards the skating-ground, and kept saying to\nhimself You mustn t be excited, you must be calm.",
      "What s the matter\nwith you?",
      "What do you want?",
      "Be quiet, stupid,  he conjured his heart.",
      "And the more he tried to compose himself, the more breathless he found\nhimself.",
      "An acquaintance met him and called him by his name, but Levin\ndid not even recognize him.",
      "He went towards the mounds, whence came the\nclank of the chains of sledges as they slipped down or were dragged up,\nthe rumble of the sliding sledges, and the sounds of merry voices.",
      "He\nwalked on a few steps, and the skating-ground lay open before his eyes,\nand at once, amidst all the skaters, he knew her.",
      "He knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized on his\nheart.",
      "She was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the\nground.",
      "There was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or\nher attitude.",
      "But for Levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a\nrose among nettles.",
      "Everything was made bright by her.",
      "She was the\nsmile that shed light on all round her.",
      "Is it possible I can go over\nthere on the ice, go up to her?",
      "he thought.",
      "The place where she stood\nseemed to him a holy shrine, unapproachable, and there was one moment\nwhen he was almost retreating, so overwhelmed was he with terror.",
      "He\nhad to make an effort to master himself, and to remind himself that\npeople of all sorts were moving about her, and that he too might come\nthere to skate.",
      "He walked down, for a long while avoiding looking at\nher as at the sun, but seeing her, as one does the sun, without\nlooking.",
      "On that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set, all\nacquainted with one another, used to meet on the ice.",
      "There were crack\nskaters there, showing off their skill, and learners clinging to chairs\nwith timid, awkward movements, boys, and elderly people skating with\nhygienic motives.",
      "They seemed to Levin an elect band of blissful beings\nbecause they were here, near her.",
      "All the skaters, it seemed, with\nperfect self-possession, skated towards her, skated by her, even spoke\nto her, and were happy, quite apart from her, enjoying the capital ice\nand the fine weather.",
      "Nikolay Shtcherbatsky, Kitty s cousin, in a short jacket and tight\ntrousers, was sitting on a garden seat with his skates on.",
      "Seeing\nLevin, he shouted to him:\n\n Ah, the first skater in Russia!",
      "Been here long?",
      "First-rate ice do put\nyour skates on.",
      "I haven t got my skates,  Levin answered, marveling at this boldness\nand ease in her presence, and not for one second losing sight of her,\nthough he did not look at her.",
      "He felt as though the sun were coming\nnear him.",
      "She was in a corner, and turning out her slender feet in\ntheir high boots with obvious timidity, she skated towards him.",
      "A boy\nin Russian dress, desperately waving his arms and bowed down to the\nground, overtook her.",
      "She skated a little uncertainly; taking her hands\nout of the little muff that hung on a cord, she held them ready for\nemergency, and looking towards Levin, whom she had recognized, she\nsmiled at him, and at her own fears.",
      "When she had got round the turn,\nshe gave herself a push off with one foot, and skated straight up to\nShtcherbatsky.",
      "Clutching at his arm, she nodded smiling to Levin.",
      "She\nwas more splendid than he had imagined her.",
      "When he thought of her, he could call up a vivid picture of her to\nhimself, especially the charm of that little fair head, so freely set\non the shapely girlish shoulders, and so full of childish brightness\nand good humor.",
      "The childishness of her expression, together with the\ndelicate beauty of her figure, made up her special charm, and that he\nfully realized.",
      "But what always struck him in her as something unlooked\nfor, was the expression of her eyes, soft, serene, and truthful, and\nabove all, her smile, which always transported Levin to an enchanted\nworld, where he felt himself softened and tender, as he remembered\nhimself in some days of his early childhood.",
      "Have you been here long?",
      "she said, giving him her hand.",
      "Thank you, \nshe added, as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her\nmuff.",
      "I?",
      "I ve not long ... yesterday ...",
      "I mean today ...",
      "I arrived, \nanswered Levin, in his emotion not at once understanding her question.",
      "I was meaning to come and see you,  he said; and then, recollecting\nwith what intention he was trying to see her, he was promptly overcome\nwith confusion and blushed.",
      "I didn t know you could skate, and skate so well.",
      "She looked at him earnestly, as though wishing to make out the cause of\nhis confusion.",
      "Your praise is worth having.",
      "The tradition is kept up here that you\nare the best of skaters,  she said, with her little black-gloved hand\nbrushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff.",
      "Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.",
      "You do everything with passion, I think,  she said smiling.",
      "I should\nso like to see how you skate.",
      "Put on skates, and let us skate\ntogether.",
      "Skate together!",
      "Can that be possible?",
      "thought Levin, gazing at her.",
      "I ll put them on directly,  he said.",
      "And he went off to get skates.",
      "It s a long while since we ve seen you here, sir,  said the attendant,\nsupporting his foot, and screwing on the heel of the skate.",
      "Except\nyou, there s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters.",
      "Will that be all\nright?",
      "said he, tightening the strap.",
      "Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,  answered Levin, with difficulty\nrestraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face.",
      "Yes,  he thought,  this now is life, this is happiness!",
      "_Together,_\nshe said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now?",
      "But that s just\nwhy I m afraid to speak because I m happy now, happy in hope,\nanyway.... And then?...",
      "But I must!",
      "I must!",
      "I must!",
      "Away with\nweakness!",
      "Levin rose to his feet, took off his overcoat, and scurrying over the\nrough ice round the hut, came out on the smooth ice and skated without\neffort, as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and\nslackening speed and turning his course.",
      "He approached with timidity,\nbut again her smile reassured him.",
      "She gave him her hand, and they set off side by side, going faster and\nfaster, and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped\nhis hand.",
      "With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,  she\nsaid to him.",
      "And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,  he said,\nbut was at once panic-stricken at what he had said, and blushed.",
      "And\nindeed, no sooner had he uttered these words, when all at once, like\nthe sun going behind a cloud, her face lost all its friendliness, and\nLevin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted the\nworking of thought; a crease showed on her smooth brow.",
      "Is there anything troubling you?",
      "though I ve no right to ask such a\nquestion,  he added hurriedly.",
      "Oh, why so?...",
      "No, I have nothing to trouble me,  she responded\ncoldly; and she added immediately:  You haven t seen Mlle.",
      "Linon, have\nyou?",
      "Not yet.",
      "Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.",
      "What s wrong?",
      "I have offended her.",
      "Lord help me!",
      "thought Levin, and\nhe flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was\nsitting on a bench.",
      "Smiling and showing her false teeth, she greeted\nhim as an old friend.",
      "Yes, you see we re growing up,  she said to him, glancing towards\nKitty,  and growing old.",
      "_Tiny bear_ has grown big now!",
      "pursued the\nFrenchwoman, laughing, and she reminded him of his joke about the three\nyoung ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the English\nnursery tale.",
      "Do you remember that s what you used to call them?",
      "He remembered absolutely nothing, but she had been laughing at the joke\nfor ten years now, and was fond of it.",
      "Now, go and skate, go and skate.",
      "Our Kitty has learned to skate\nnicely, hasn t she?",
      "When Levin darted up to Kitty her face was no longer stern; her eyes\nlooked at him with the same sincerity and friendliness, but Levin\nfancied that in her friendliness there was a certain note of deliberate\ncomposure.",
      "And he felt depressed.",
      "After talking a little of her old\ngoverness and her peculiarities, she questioned him about his life.",
      "Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren t you?",
      "she\nsaid.",
      "No, I m not dull, I am very busy,  he said, feeling that she was\nholding him in check by her composed tone, which he would not have the\nforce to break through, just as it had been at the beginning of the\nwinter.",
      "Are you going to stay in town long?",
      "Kitty questioned him.",
      "I don t know,  he answered, not thinking of what he was saying.",
      "The\nthought that if he were held in check by her tone of quiet friendliness\nhe would end by going back again without deciding anything came into\nhis mind, and he resolved to make a struggle against it.",
      "How is it you don t know?",
      "I don t know.",
      "It depends upon you,  he said, and was immediately\nhorror-stricken at his own words.",
      "Whether it was that she had heard his words, or that she did not want\nto hear them, she made a sort of stumble, twice struck out, and\nhurriedly skated away from him.",
      "She skated up to Mlle.",
      "Linon, said\nsomething to her, and went towards the pavilion where the ladies took\noff their skates.",
      "My God!",
      "what have I done!",
      "Merciful God!",
      "help me, guide me,  said\nLevin, praying inwardly, and at the same time, feeling a need of\nviolent exercise, he skated about describing inner and outer circles.",
      "At that moment one of the young men, the best of the skaters of the\nday, came out of the coffee-house in his skates, with a cigarette in\nhis mouth.",
      "Taking a run, he dashed down the steps in his skates,\ncrashing and bounding up and down.",
      "He flew down, and without even\nchanging the position of his hands, skated away over the ice.",
      "Ah, that s a new trick!",
      "said Levin, and he promptly ran up to the top\nto do this new trick.",
      "Don t break your neck!",
      "it needs practice!",
      "Nikolay Shtcherbatsky\nshouted after him.",
      "Levin went to the steps, took a run from above as best he could, and\ndashed down, preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his\nhands.",
      "On the last step he stumbled, but barely touching the ice with\nhis hand, with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off,\nlaughing.",
      "How splendid, how nice he is!",
      "Kitty was thinking at that time, as she\ncame out of the pavilion with Mlle.",
      "Linon, and looked towards him with\na smile of quiet affection, as though he were a favorite brother.",
      "And\ncan it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong?",
      "They talk of\nflirtation.",
      "I know it s not he that I love; but still I am happy with\nhim, and he s so jolly.",
      "Only, why did he say that?...",
      "she mused.",
      "Catching sight of Kitty going away, and her mother meeting her at the\nsteps, Levin, flushed from his rapid exercise, stood still and pondered\na minute.",
      "He took off his skates, and overtook the mother and daughter\nat the entrance of the gardens.",
      "Delighted to see you,  said Princess Shtcherbatskaya.",
      "On Thursdays we\nare home, as always.",
      "Today, then?",
      "We shall be pleased to see you,  the princess said stiffly.",
      "This stiffness hurt Kitty, and she could not resist the desire to\nsmooth over her mother s coldness.",
      "She turned her head, and with a\nsmile said:\n\n Good-bye till this evening.",
      "At that moment Stepan Arkadyevitch, his hat cocked on one side, with\nbeaming face and eyes, strode into the garden like a conquering hero.",
      "But as he approached his mother-in-law, he responded in a mournful and\ncrestfallen tone to her inquiries about Dolly s health.",
      "After a little\nsubdued and dejected conversation with his mother-in-law, he threw out\nhis chest again, and put his arm in Levin s.\n\n Well, shall we set off?",
      "he asked.",
      "I ve been thinking about you all\nthis time, and I m very, very glad you ve come,  he said, looking him\nin the face with a significant air.",
      "Yes, come along,  answered Levin in ecstasy, hearing unceasingly the\nsound of that voice saying,  Good-bye till this evening,  and seeing\nthe smile with which it was said.",
      "To the England or the Hermitage?",
      "I don t mind which.",
      "All right, then, the England,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, selecting\nthat restaurant because he owed more there than at the Hermitage, and\nconsequently considered it mean to avoid it.",
      "Have you got a sledge?",
      "That s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.",
      "The friends hardly spoke all the way.",
      "Levin was wondering what that\nchange in Kitty s expression had meant, and alternately assuring\nhimself that there was hope, and falling into despair, seeing clearly\nthat his hopes were insane, and yet all the while he felt himself quite\nanother man, utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those\nwords,  Good-bye till this evening.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu\nof the dinner.",
      "You like turbot, don t you?",
      "he said to Levin as they were arriving.",
      "Eh?",
      "responded Levin.",
      "Turbot?",
      "Yes, I m _awfully_ fond of turbot.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nWhen Levin went into the restaurant with Oblonsky, he could not help\nnoticing a certain peculiarity of expression, as it were, a restrained\nradiance, about the face and whole figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat over one ear walked\ninto the dining-room, giving directions to the Tatar waiters, who were\nclustered about him in evening coats, bearing napkins.",
      "Bowing to right\nand left to the people he met, and here as everywhere joyously greeting\nacquaintances, he went up to the sideboard for a preliminary appetizer\nof fish and vodka, and said to the painted Frenchwoman decked in\nribbons, lace, and ringlets, behind the counter, something so amusing\nthat even that Frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter.",
      "Levin for his\npart refrained from taking any vodka simply because he felt such a\nloathing of that Frenchwoman, all made up, it seemed, of false hair,\n_poudre de riz,_ and _vinaigre de toilette_.",
      "He made haste to move away\nfrom her, as from a dirty place.",
      "His whole soul was filled with\nmemories of Kitty, and there was a smile of triumph and happiness\nshining in his eyes.",
      "This way, your excellency, please.",
      "Your excellency won t be disturbed\nhere,  said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with\nimmense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind.",
      "Walk in, your\nexcellency,  he said to Levin; by way of showing his respect to Stepan\nArkadyevitch, being attentive to his guest as well.",
      "Instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze\nchandelier, though it already had a table cloth on it, he pushed up\nvelvet chairs, and came to a standstill before Stepan Arkadyevitch with\na napkin and a bill of fare in his hands, awaiting his commands.",
      "If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free\ndirectly; Prince Golistin with a lady.",
      "Fresh oysters have come in.",
      "Ah!",
      "oysters.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch became thoughtful.",
      "How if we were to change our program, Levin?",
      "he said, keeping his\nfinger on the bill of fare.",
      "And his face expressed serious hesitation.",
      "Are the oysters good?",
      "Mind now.",
      "They re Flensburg, your excellency.",
      "We ve no Ostend.",
      "Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?",
      "Only arrived yesterday.",
      "Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the\nwhole program?",
      "Eh?",
      "It s all the same to me.",
      "I should like cabbage soup and porridge\nbetter than anything; but of course there s nothing like that here.",
      "_Porridge   la Russe,_ your honor would like?",
      "said the Tatar, bending\ndown to Levin, like a nurse speaking to a child.",
      "No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good.",
      "I ve been\nskating, and I m hungry.",
      "And don t imagine,  he added, detecting a look\nof dissatisfaction on Oblonsky s face,  that I shan t appreciate your\nchoice.",
      "I am fond of good things.",
      "I should hope so!",
      "After all, it s one of the pleasures of life,  said\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, then, my friend, you give us two or better\nsay three dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables.... \n\n _Printani re,_  prompted the Tatar.",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch apparently\ndid not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the French names\nof the dishes.",
      "With vegetables in it, you know.",
      "Then turbot with thick sauce, then\n... roast beef; and mind it s good.",
      "Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then\nsweets.",
      "The Tatar, recollecting that it was Stepan Arkadyevitch s way not to\ncall the dishes by the names in the French bill of fare, did not repeat\nthem after him, but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to\nhimself according to the bill: _Soupe printani re, turbot, sauce\nBeaumarchais, poulard   l estragon, mac doine de fruits_ ...",
      "etc.,  and\nthen instantly, as though worked by springs, laying down one bound bill\nof fare, he took up another, the list of wines, and submitted it to\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "What shall we drink?",
      "What you like, only not too much.",
      "Champagne,  said Levin.",
      "What!",
      "to start with?",
      "You re right though, I dare say.",
      "Do you like the\nwhite seal?",
      "_Cachet blanc,_  prompted the Tatar.",
      "Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we ll\nsee.",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "And what table wine?",
      "You can give us Nuits.",
      "Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "And _your_ cheese, your excellency?",
      "Oh, yes, Parmesan.",
      "Or would you like another?",
      "No, it s all the same to me,  said Levin, unable to suppress a smile.",
      "And the Tatar ran off with flying coat-tails, and in five minutes\ndarted in with a dish of opened oysters on mother-of-pearl shells, and\na bottle between his fingers.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch crushed the starchy napkin, tucked it into his\nwaistcoat, and settling his arms comfortably, started on the oysters.",
      "Not bad,  he said, stripping the oysters from the pearly shell with a\nsilver fork, and swallowing them one after another.",
      "Not bad,  he\nrepeated, turning his dewy, brilliant eyes from Levin to the Tatar.",
      "Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have\npleased him better.",
      "But he was admiring Oblonsky.",
      "Even the Tatar,\nuncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate\nglasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat\nwith a perceptible smile of satisfaction.",
      "You don t care much for oysters, do you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nemptying his wine-glass,  or you re worried about something.",
      "Eh?",
      "He wanted Levin to be in good spirits.",
      "But it was not that Levin was\nnot in good spirits; he was ill at ease.",
      "With what he had in his soul,\nhe felt sore and uncomfortable in the restaurant, in the midst of\nprivate rooms where men were dining with ladies, in all this fuss and\nbustle; the surroundings of bronzes, looking-glasses, gas, and\nwaiters all of it was offensive to him.",
      "He was afraid of sullying what\nhis soul was brimful of.",
      "I?",
      "Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,  he said.",
      "You can t\nconceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer\nas that gentleman s nails I saw at your place....",
      "Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch s nails, \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing.",
      "It s too much for me,  responded Levin.",
      "Do try, now, and put yourself\nin my place, take the point of view of a country person.",
      "We in the\ncountry try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most\nconvenient for working with.",
      "So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up\nour sleeves.",
      "And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as\nthey will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can\ndo nothing with their hands.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled gaily.",
      "Oh, yes, that s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work.",
      "His\nwork is with the mind.... \n\n Maybe.",
      "But still it s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems\nqueer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as\nwe can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to\ndrag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating\noysters.... \n\n Why, of course,  objected Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But that s just the\naim of civilization to make everything a source of enjoyment.",
      "Well, if that s its aim, I d rather be a savage.",
      "And so you are a savage.",
      "All you Levins are savages.",
      "Levin sighed.",
      "He remembered his brother Nikolay, and felt ashamed and\nsore, and he scowled; but Oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at\nonce drew his attention.",
      "Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys , I\nmean?",
      "he said, his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the\nempty rough shells, and drew the cheese towards him.",
      "Yes, I shall certainly go,  replied Levin;  though I fancied the\nprincess was not very warm in her invitation.",
      "What nonsense!",
      "That s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!...",
      "That s\nher manner _grande dame,_  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I m coming, too,\nbut I have to go to the Countess Bonina s rehearsal.",
      "Come, isn t it\ntrue that you re a savage?",
      "How do you explain the sudden way in which\nyou vanished from Moscow?",
      "The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me\nabout you, as though I ought to know.",
      "The only thing I know is that you\nalways do what no one else does.",
      "Yes,  said Levin, slowly and with emotion,  you re right.",
      "I am a\nsavage.",
      "Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming\nnow.",
      "Now I have come.... \n\n Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!",
      "broke in Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nlooking into Levin s eyes.",
      "Why?",
      "I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,\n\nAnd by his eyes I know a youth in love, \n\n\n\ndeclaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Everything is before you.",
      "Why, is it over for you already?",
      "No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is\nmine, and the present well, it s not all that it might be.",
      "How so?",
      "Oh, things go wrong.",
      "But I don t want to talk of myself, and besides I\ncan t explain it all,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, why have you\ncome to Moscow, then?...",
      "Hi!",
      "take away!",
      "he called to the Tatar.",
      "You guess?",
      "responded Levin, his eyes like deep wells of light fixed\non Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I guess, but I can t be the first to talk about it.",
      "You can see by\nthat whether I guess right or wrong,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, gazing\nat Levin with a subtle smile.",
      "Well, and what have you to say to me?",
      "said Levin in a quivering\nvoice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too.",
      "How do you look at the question?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch slowly emptied his glass of Chablis, never taking\nhis eyes off Levin.",
      "I?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,  there s nothing I desire so much as\nthat nothing!",
      "It would be the best thing that could be.",
      "But you re not making a mistake?",
      "You know what we re speaking of?",
      "said Levin, piercing him with his eyes.",
      "You think it s possible?",
      "I think it s possible.",
      "Why not possible?",
      "No!",
      "do you really think it s possible?",
      "No, tell me all you think!",
      "Oh,\nbut if ... if refusal s in store for me!...",
      "Indeed I feel sure.... \n\n Why should you think that?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling at his\nexcitement.",
      "It seems so to me sometimes.",
      "That will be awful for me, and for her\ntoo.",
      "Oh, well, anyway there s nothing awful in it for a girl.",
      "Every girl s\nproud of an offer.",
      "Yes, every girl, but not she.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",
      "He so well knew that feeling of Levin s,\nthat for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes:\none class all the girls in the world except her, and those girls with\nall sorts of human weaknesses, and very ordinary girls: the other\nclass she alone, having no weaknesses of any sort and higher than all\nhumanity.",
      "Stay, take some sauce,  he said, holding back Levin s hand as it\npushed away the sauce.",
      "Levin obediently helped himself to sauce, but would not let Stepan\nArkadyevitch go on with his dinner.",
      "No, stop a minute, stop a minute,  he said.",
      "You must understand that\nit s a question of life and death for me.",
      "I have never spoken to anyone\nof this.",
      "And there s no one I could speak of it to, except you.",
      "You\nknow we re utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and\neverything; but I know you re fond of me and understand me, and that s\nwhy I like you awfully.",
      "But for God s sake, be quite straightforward\nwith me.",
      "I tell you what I think,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "But I ll\nsay more: my wife is a wonderful woman....  Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed,\nremembering his position with his wife, and, after a moment s silence,\nresumed She has a gift of foreseeing things.",
      "She sees right through\npeople; but that s not all; she knows what will come to pass,\nespecially in the way of marriages.",
      "She foretold, for instance, that\nPrincess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln.",
      "No one would believe it, but\nit came to pass.",
      "And she s on your side.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "It s not only that she likes you she says that Kitty is certain to be\nyour wife.",
      "At these words Levin s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile\nnot far from tears of emotion.",
      "She says that!",
      "cried Levin.",
      "I always said she was exquisite, your\nwife.",
      "There, that s enough, enough said about it,  he said, getting up\nfrom his seat.",
      "All right, but do sit down.",
      "But Levin could not sit down.",
      "He walked with his firm tread twice up\nand down the little cage of a room, blinked his eyelids that his tears\nmight not fall, and only then sat down to the table.",
      "You must understand,  said he,  it s not love.",
      "I ve been in love, but\nit s not that.",
      "It s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has\ntaken possession of me.",
      "I went away, you see, because I made up my mind\nthat it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not\ncome on earth; but I ve struggled with myself, I see there s no living\nwithout it.",
      "And it must be settled.",
      "What did you go away for?",
      "Ah, stop a minute!",
      "Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one!",
      "The\nquestions one must ask oneself!",
      "Listen.",
      "You can t imagine what you ve\ndone for me by what you said.",
      "I m so happy that I ve become positively\nhateful; I ve forgotten everything.",
      "I heard today that my brother\nNikolay ... you know, he s here ...",
      "I had even forgotten him.",
      "It seems\nto me that he s happy too.",
      "It s a sort of madness.",
      "But one thing s\nawful....",
      "Here, you ve been married, you know the feeling ... it s\nawful that we old with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are\nbrought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it s\nloathsome, and that s why one can t help feeling oneself unworthy.",
      "Oh, well, you ve not many sins on your conscience.",
      "Alas!",
      "all the same,  said Levin,  when with loathing I go over my\nlife, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it....",
      "Yes.",
      "What would you have?",
      "The world s made so,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked:  Forgive me\nnot according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy\nloving-kindness.",
      "That s the only way she can forgive me.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nLevin emptied his glass, and they were silent for a while.",
      "There s one other thing I ought to tell you.",
      "Do you know Vronsky?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Levin.",
      "No, I don t. Why do you ask?",
      "Give us another bottle,  Stepan Arkadyevitch directed the Tatar, who\nwas filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was\nnot wanted.",
      "Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he s one of your rivals.",
      "Who s Vronsky?",
      "said Levin, and his face was suddenly transformed from\nthe look of childlike ecstasy which Oblonsky had just been admiring to\nan angry and unpleasant expression.",
      "Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one\nof the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg.",
      "I made his\nacquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came\nthere for the levy of recruits.",
      "Fearfully rich, handsome, great\nconnections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice,\ngood-natured fellow.",
      "But he s more than simply a good-natured fellow,\nas I ve found out here he s a cultivated man, too, and very\nintelligent; he s a man who ll make his mark.",
      "Levin scowled and was dumb.",
      "Well, he turned up here soon after you d gone, and as I can see, he s\nover head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her\nmother....",
      "Excuse me, but I know nothing,  said Levin, frowning gloomily.",
      "And\nimmediately he recollected his brother Nikolay and how hateful he was\nto have been able to forget him.",
      "You wait a bit, wait a bit,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling and\ntouching his hand.",
      "I ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in\nthis delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I\nbelieve the chances are in your favor.",
      "Levin dropped back in his chair; his face was pale.",
      "But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,  pursued\nOblonsky, filling up his glass.",
      "No, thanks, I can t drink any more,  said Levin, pushing away his\nglass.",
      "I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?",
      "he\nwent on, obviously anxious to change the conversation.",
      "One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.",
      "Tonight I don t advise you to speak,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Go\nround tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless\nyou.... \n\n Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting?",
      "Come next\nspring, do,  said Levin.",
      "Now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this\nconversation with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "A feeling such as his was\nprofaned by talk of the rivalry of some Petersburg officer, of the\nsuppositions and the counsels of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",
      "He knew what was passing in Levin s soul.",
      "I ll come some day,  he said.",
      "But women, my boy, they re the pivot\neverything turns upon.",
      "Things are in a bad way with me, very bad.",
      "And\nit s all through women.",
      "Tell me frankly now,  he pursued, picking up a\ncigar and keeping one hand on his glass;  give me your advice.",
      "Why, what is it?",
      "I ll tell you.",
      "Suppose you re married, you love your wife, but you re\nfascinated by another woman....",
      "Excuse me, but I m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I\ncan t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a\nbaker s shop and steal a roll.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled more than usual.",
      "Why not?",
      "A roll will sometimes smell so good one can t resist it.",
      "Himmlisch ist s, wenn ich bezwungen\n\n    Meine irdische Begier;\n\nAber doch wenn s nich gelungen\n\n    Hatt  ich auch recht h bsch Plaisir!",
      "As he said this, Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled subtly.",
      "Levin, too, could\nnot help smiling.",
      "Yes, but joking apart,  resumed Stepan Arkadyevitch,  you must\nunderstand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and\nlonely, and has sacrificed everything.",
      "Now, when the thing s done,\ndon t you see, can one possibly cast her off?",
      "Even supposing one parts\nfrom her, so as not to break up one s family life, still, can one help\nfeeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?",
      "Well, you must excuse me there.",
      "You know to me all women are divided\ninto two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and\nthere are ...",
      "I ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never\nshall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the\ncounter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women\nare the same.",
      "But the Magdalen?",
      "Ah, drop that!",
      "Christ would never have said those words if He had\nknown how they would be abused.",
      "Of all the Gospel those words are the\nonly ones remembered.",
      "However, I m not saying so much what I think, as\nwhat I feel.",
      "I have a loathing for fallen women.",
      "You re afraid of\nspiders, and I of these vermin.",
      "Most likely you ve not made a study of\nspiders and don t know their character; and so it is with me.",
      "It s very well for you to talk like that; it s very much like that\ngentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his\nright shoulder.",
      "But to deny the facts is no answer.",
      "What s to be\ndone you tell me that, what s to be done?",
      "Your wife gets older, while\nyou re full of life.",
      "Before you ve time to look round, you feel that\nyou can t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.",
      "And then all at once love turns up, and you re done for, done for, \nStepan Arkadyevitch said with weary despair.",
      "Levin half smiled.",
      "Yes, you re done for,  resumed Oblonsky.",
      "But what s to be done?",
      "Don t steal rolls.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed outright.",
      "Oh, moralist!",
      "But you must understand, there are two women; one\ninsists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you\ncan t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks\nfor nothing.",
      "What are you to do?",
      "How are you to act?",
      "There s a fearful\ntragedy in it.",
      "If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I ll tell you\nthat I don t believe there was any tragedy about it.",
      "And this is why.",
      "To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato\ndefines in his Banquet, served as the test of men.",
      "Some men only\nunderstand one sort, and some only the other.",
      "And those who only know\nthe non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy.",
      "In such love\nthere can be no sort of tragedy.",
      "I m much obliged for the\ngratification, my humble respects that s all the tragedy.",
      "And in\nplatonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is\nclear and pure, because.... \n\nAt that instant Levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict\nhe had lived through.",
      "And he added unexpectedly:\n\n But perhaps you are right.",
      "Very likely ...",
      "I don t know, I don t\nknow.",
      "It s this, don t you see,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,  you re very much\nall of a piece.",
      "That s your strong point and your failing.",
      "You have a\ncharacter that s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be\nof a piece too but that s not how it is.",
      "You despise public official\nwork because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all\nthe while with the aim and that s not how it is.",
      "You want a man s work,\ntoo, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to\nbe undivided and that s not how it is.",
      "All the variety, all the charm,\nall the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.",
      "Levin sighed and made no reply.",
      "He was thinking of his own affairs, and\ndid not hear Oblonsky.",
      "And suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends, though\nthey had been dining and drinking together, which should have drawn\nthem closer, yet each was thinking only of his own affairs, and they\nhad nothing to do with one another.",
      "Oblonsky had more than once\nexperienced this extreme sense of aloofness, instead of intimacy,\ncoming on after dinner, and he knew what to do in such cases.",
      "Bill!",
      "he called, and he went into the next room where he promptly\ncame across an aide-de-camp of his acquaintance and dropped into\nconversation with him about an actress and her protector.",
      "And at once\nin the conversation with the aide-de-camp Oblonsky had a sense of\nrelaxation and relief after the conversation with Levin, which always\nput him to too great a mental and spiritual strain.",
      "When the Tatar appeared with a bill for twenty-six roubles and odd\nkopecks, besides a tip for himself, Levin, who would another time have\nbeen horrified, like anyone from the country, at his share of fourteen\nroubles, did not notice it, paid, and set off homewards to dress and go\nto the Shtcherbatskys  there to decide his fate.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nThe young Princess Kitty Shtcherbatskaya was eighteen.",
      "It was the first\nwinter that she had been out in the world.",
      "Her success in society had\nbeen greater than that of either of her elder sisters, and greater even\nthan her mother had anticipated.",
      "To say nothing of the young men who\ndanced at the Moscow balls being almost all in love with Kitty, two\nserious suitors had already this first winter made their appearance:\nLevin, and immediately after his departure, Count Vronsky.",
      "Levin s appearance at the beginning of the winter, his frequent visits,\nand evident love for Kitty, had led to the first serious conversations\nbetween Kitty s parents as to her future, and to disputes between them.",
      "The prince was on Levin s side; he said he wished for nothing better\nfor Kitty.",
      "The princess for her part, going round the question in the\nmanner peculiar to women, maintained that Kitty was too young, that\nLevin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions, that\nKitty felt no great attraction to him, and other side issues; but she\ndid not state the principal point, which was that she looked for a\nbetter match for her daughter, and that Levin was not to her liking,\nand she did not understand him.",
      "When Levin had abruptly departed, the\nprincess was delighted, and said to her husband triumphantly:  You see\nI was right.",
      "When Vronsky appeared on the scene, she was still more\ndelighted, confirmed in her opinion that Kitty was to make not simply a\ngood, but a brilliant match.",
      "In the mother s eyes there could be no comparison between Vronsky and\nLevin.",
      "She disliked in Levin his strange and uncompromising opinions\nand his shyness in society, founded, as she supposed, on his pride and\nhis queer sort of life, as she considered it, absorbed in cattle and\npeasants.",
      "She did not very much like it that he, who was in love with\nher daughter, had kept coming to the house for six weeks, as though he\nwere waiting for something, inspecting, as though he were afraid he\nmight be doing them too great an honor by making an offer, and did not\nrealize that a man, who continually visits at a house where there is a\nyoung unmarried girl, is bound to make his intentions clear.",
      "And\nsuddenly, without doing so, he disappeared.",
      "It s as well he s not\nattractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him,  thought\nthe mother.",
      "Vronsky satisfied all the mother s desires.",
      "Very wealthy, clever, of\naristocratic family, on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army\nand at court, and a fascinating man.",
      "Nothing better could be wished\nfor.",
      "Vronsky openly flirted with Kitty at balls, danced with her, and came\ncontinually to the house, consequently there could be no doubt of the\nseriousness of his intentions.",
      "But, in spite of that, the mother had\nspent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and\nagitation.",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya had herself been married thirty years ago, her\naunt arranging the match.",
      "Her husband, about whom everything was well\nknown beforehand, had come, looked at his future bride, and been looked\nat.",
      "The matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual\nimpression.",
      "That impression had been favorable.",
      "Afterwards, on a day\nfixed beforehand, the expected offer was made to her parents, and\naccepted.",
      "All had passed very simply and easily.",
      "So it seemed, at\nleast, to the princess.",
      "But over her own daughters she had felt how far\nfrom simple and easy is the business, apparently so commonplace, of\nmarrying off one s daughters.",
      "The panics that had been lived through,\nthe thoughts that had been brooded over, the money that had been\nwasted, and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder\ngirls, Darya and Natalia!",
      "Now, since the youngest had come out, she was\ngoing through the same terrors, the same doubts, and still more violent\nquarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls.",
      "The old\nprince, like all fathers indeed, was exceedingly punctilious on the\nscore of the honor and reputation of his daughters.",
      "He was irrationally\njealous over his daughters, especially over Kitty, who was his\nfavorite.",
      "At every turn he had scenes with the princess for\ncompromising her daughter.",
      "The princess had grown accustomed to this\nalready with her other daughters, but now she felt that there was more\nground for the prince s touchiness.",
      "She saw that of late years much was\nchanged in the manners of society, that a mother s duties had become\nstill more difficult.",
      "She saw that girls of Kitty s age formed some\nsort of clubs, went to some sort of lectures, mixed freely in men s\nsociety; drove about the streets alone, many of them did not curtsey,\nand, what was the most important thing, all the girls were firmly\nconvinced that to choose their husbands was their own affair, and not\ntheir parents .",
      "Marriages aren t made nowadays as they used to be, \nwas thought and said by all these young girls, and even by their\nelders.",
      "But how marriages were made now, the princess could not learn\nfrom anyone.",
      "The French fashion of the parents arranging their\nchildren s future was not accepted; it was condemned.",
      "The English\nfashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted,\nand not possible in Russian society.",
      "The Russian fashion of matchmaking\nby the offices of intermediate persons was for some reason considered\nunseemly; it was ridiculed by everyone, and by the princess herself.",
      "But how girls were to be married, and how parents were to marry them,\nno one knew.",
      "Everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the\nmatter said the same thing:  Mercy on us, it s high time in our day to\ncast off all that old-fashioned business.",
      "It s the young people have to\nmarry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people\nto arrange it as they choose.",
      "It was very easy for anyone to say that\nwho had no daughters, but the princess realized that in the process of\ngetting to know each other, her daughter might fall in love, and fall\nin love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite\nunfit to be her husband.",
      "And, however much it was instilled into the\nprincess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives\nfor themselves, she was unable to believe it, just as she would have\nbeen unable to believe that, at any time whatever, the most suitable\nplaythings for children five years old ought to be loaded pistols.",
      "And\nso the princess was more uneasy over Kitty than she had been over her\nelder sisters.",
      "Now she was afraid that Vronsky might confine himself to simply\nflirting with her daughter.",
      "She saw that her daughter was in love with\nhim, but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an\nhonorable man, and would not do this.",
      "But at the same time she knew how\neasy it is, with the freedom of manners of today, to turn a girl s\nhead, and how lightly men generally regard such a crime.",
      "The week\nbefore, Kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with\nVronsky during a mazurka.",
      "This conversation had partly reassured the\nprincess; but perfectly at ease she could not be.",
      "Vronsky had told\nKitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother\nthat they never made up their minds to any important undertaking\nwithout consulting her.",
      "And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my\nmother s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,  he told\nher.",
      "Kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the\nwords.",
      "But her mother saw them in a different light.",
      "She knew that the\nold lady was expected from day to day, that she would be pleased at her\nson s choice, and she felt it strange that he should not make his offer\nthrough fear of vexing his mother.",
      "However, she was so anxious for the\nmarriage itself, and still more for relief from her fears, that she\nbelieved it was so.",
      "Bitter as it was for the princess to see the\nunhappiness of her eldest daughter, Dolly, on the point of leaving her\nhusband, her anxiety over the decision of her youngest daughter s fate\nengrossed all her feelings.",
      "Today, with Levin s reappearance, a fresh\nsource of anxiety arose.",
      "She was afraid that her daughter, who had at\none time, as she fancied, a feeling for Levin, might, from extreme\nsense of honor, refuse Vronsky, and that Levin s arrival might\ngenerally complicate and delay the affair so near being concluded.",
      "Why, has he been here long?",
      "the princess asked about Levin, as they\nreturned home.",
      "He came today, mamma.",
      "There s one thing I want to say....  began the princess, and from her\nserious and alert face, Kitty guessed what it would be.",
      "Mamma,  she said, flushing hotly and turning quickly to her,  please,\nplease don t say anything about that.",
      "I know, I know all about it.",
      "She wished for what her mother wished for, but the motives of her\nmother s wishes wounded her.",
      "I only want to say that to raise hopes.... \n\n Mamma, darling, for goodness  sake, don t talk about it.",
      "It s so\nhorrible to talk about it.",
      "I won t,  said her mother, seeing the tears in her daughter s eyes;\n but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from\nme.",
      "You won t?",
      "Never, mamma, none,  answered Kitty, flushing a little, and looking\nher mother straight in the face,  but there s no use in my telling you\nanything, and I ...",
      "I ... if I wanted to, I don t know what to say or\nhow....",
      "I don t know.... \n\n No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,  thought the\nmother, smiling at her agitation and happiness.",
      "The princess smiled\nthat what was taking place just now in her soul seemed to the poor\nchild so immense and so important.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nAfter dinner, and till the beginning of the evening, Kitty was feeling\na sensation akin to the sensation of a young man before a battle.",
      "Her\nheart throbbed violently, and her thoughts would not rest on anything.",
      "She felt that this evening, when they would both meet for the first\ntime, would be a turning point in her life.",
      "And she was continually\npicturing them to herself, at one moment each separately, and then both\ntogether.",
      "When she mused on the past, she dwelt with pleasure, with\ntenderness, on the memories of her relations with Levin.",
      "The memories\nof childhood and of Levin s friendship with her dead brother gave a\nspecial poetic charm to her relations with him.",
      "His love for her, of\nwhich she felt certain, was flattering and delightful to her; and it\nwas pleasant for her to think of Levin.",
      "In her memories of Vronsky\nthere always entered a certain element of awkwardness, though he was in\nthe highest degree well-bred and at ease, as though there were some\nfalse note not in Vronsky, he was very simple and nice, but in herself,\nwhile with Levin she felt perfectly simple and clear.",
      "But, on the other\nhand, directly she thought of the future with Vronsky, there arose\nbefore her a perspective of brilliant happiness; with Levin the future\nseemed misty.",
      "When she went upstairs to dress, and looked into the looking-glass, she\nnoticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in\ncomplete possession of all her forces, she needed this so for what lay\nbefore her: she was conscious of external composure and free grace in\nher movements.",
      "At half-past seven she had only just gone down into the drawing-room,\nwhen the footman announced,  Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.",
      "The\nprincess was still in her room, and the prince had not come in.",
      "So it\nis to be,  thought Kitty, and all the blood seemed to rush to her\nheart.",
      "She was horrified at her paleness, as she glanced into the\nlooking-glass.",
      "At that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come\nearly on purpose to find her alone and to make her an offer.",
      "And only\nthen for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new,\ndifferent aspect; only then she realized that the question did not\naffect her only with whom she would be happy, and whom she loved but\nthat she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked.",
      "And to\nwound him cruelly.",
      "What for?",
      "Because he, dear fellow, loved her, was in\nlove with her.",
      "But there was no help for it, so it must be, so it would\nhave to be.",
      "My God!",
      "shall I myself really have to say it to him?",
      "she thought.",
      "Can I tell him I don t love him?",
      "That will be a lie.",
      "What am I to say\nto him?",
      "That I love someone else?",
      "No, that s impossible.",
      "I m going\naway, I m going away.",
      "She had reached the door, when she heard his step.",
      "No!",
      "it s not\nhonest.",
      "What have I to be afraid of?",
      "I have done nothing wrong.",
      "What is\nto be, will be!",
      "I ll tell the truth.",
      "And with him one can t be ill at\nease.",
      "Here he is,  she said to herself, seeing his powerful, shy\nfigure, with his shining eyes fixed on her.",
      "She looked straight into\nhis face, as though imploring him to spare her, and gave her hand.",
      "It s not time yet; I think I m too early,  he said glancing round the\nempty drawing-room.",
      "When he saw that his expectations were realized,\nthat there was nothing to prevent him from speaking, his face became\ngloomy.",
      "Oh, no,  said Kitty, and sat down at the table.",
      "But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,  he began, not\nsitting down, and not looking at her, so as not to lose courage.",
      "Mamma will be down directly.",
      "She was very much tired....",
      "Yesterday.... \n\nShe talked on, not knowing what her lips were uttering, and not taking\nher supplicating and caressing eyes off him.",
      "He glanced at her; she blushed, and ceased speaking.",
      "I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it\ndepended on you.... \n\nShe dropped her head lower and lower, not knowing herself what answer\nshe should make to what was coming.",
      "That it depended on you,  he repeated.",
      "I meant to say ...",
      "I meant to\nsay ...",
      "I came for this ... to be my wife!",
      "he brought out, not knowing\nwhat he was saying; but feeling that the most terrible thing was said,\nhe stopped short and looked at her....\n\nShe was breathing heavily, not looking at him.",
      "She was feeling ecstasy.",
      "Her soul was flooded with happiness.",
      "She had never anticipated that the\nutterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her.",
      "But it\nlasted only an instant.",
      "She remembered Vronsky.",
      "She lifted her clear,\ntruthful eyes, and seeing his desperate face, she answered hastily:\n\n That cannot be ... forgive me.",
      "A moment ago, and how close she had been to him, of what importance in\nhis life!",
      "And how aloof and remote from him she had become now!",
      "It was bound to be so,  he said, not looking at her.",
      "He bowed, and was meaning to retreat.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nBut at that very moment the princess came in.",
      "There was a look of\nhorror on her face when she saw them alone, and their disturbed faces.",
      "Levin bowed to her, and said nothing.",
      "Kitty did not speak nor lift her\neyes.",
      "Thank God, she has refused him,  thought the mother, and her\nface lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her\nguests on Thursdays.",
      "She sat down and began questioning Levin about his\nlife in the country.",
      "He sat down again, waiting for other visitors to\narrive, in order to retreat unnoticed.",
      "Five minutes later there came in a friend of Kitty s, married the\npreceding winter, Countess Nordston.",
      "She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black\neyes.",
      "She was fond of Kitty, and her affection for her showed itself,\nas the affection of married women for girls always does, in the desire\nto make a match for Kitty after her own ideal of married happiness; she\nwanted her to marry Vronsky.",
      "Levin she had often met at the\nShtcherbatskys  early in the winter, and she had always disliked him.",
      "Her invariable and favorite pursuit, when they met, consisted in making\nfun of him.",
      "I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,\nor breaks off his learned conversation with me because I m a fool, or\nis condescending to me.",
      "I like that so; to see him condescending!",
      "I am\nso glad he can t bear me,  she used to say of him.",
      "She was right, for Levin actually could not bear her, and despised her\nfor what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her\nnervousness, her delicate contempt and indifference for everything\ncoarse and earthly.",
      "The Countess Nordston and Levin got into that relation with one another\nnot seldom seen in society, when two persons, who remain externally on\nfriendly terms, despise each other to such a degree that they cannot\neven take each other seriously, and cannot even be offended by each\nother.",
      "The Countess Nordston pounced upon Levin at once.",
      "Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "So you ve come back to our corrupt\nBabylon,  she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling\nwhat he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a\nBabylon.",
      "Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?",
      "she\nadded, glancing with a simper at Kitty.",
      "It s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so\nwell,  responded Levin, who had succeeded in recovering his composure,\nand at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the\nCountess Nordston.",
      "They must certainly make a great impression on\nyou.",
      "Oh, I should think so!",
      "I always note them all down.",
      "Well, Kitty, have\nyou been skating again?...",
      "And she began talking to Kitty.",
      "Awkward as it was for Levin to withdraw\nnow, it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this\nawkwardness than to remain all the evening and see Kitty, who glanced\nat him now and then and avoided his eyes.",
      "He was on the point of\ngetting up, when the princess, noticing that he was silent, addressed\nhim.",
      "Shall you be long in Moscow?",
      "You re busy with the district council,\nthough, aren t you, and can t be away for long?",
      "No, princess, I m no longer a member of the council,  he said.",
      "I have\ncome up for a few days.",
      "There s something the matter with him,  thought Countess Nordston,\nglancing at his stern, serious face.",
      "He isn t in his old argumentative\nmood.",
      "But I ll draw him out.",
      "I do love making a fool of him before\nKitty, and I ll do it.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  she said to him,  do explain to me, please,\nwhat s the meaning of it.",
      "You know all about such things.",
      "At home in\nour village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up\nall they possessed, and now they can t pay us any rent.",
      "What s the\nmeaning of that?",
      "You always praise the peasants so.",
      "At that instant another lady came into the room, and Levin got up.",
      "Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can t\ntell you anything,  he said, and looked round at the officer who came\nin behind the lady.",
      "That must be Vronsky,  thought Levin, and, to be sure of it, glanced\nat Kitty.",
      "She had already had time to look at Vronsky, and looked round\nat Levin.",
      "And simply from the look in her eyes, that grew unconsciously\nbrighter, Levin knew that she loved that man, knew it as surely as if\nshe had told him so in words.",
      "But what sort of a man was he?",
      "Now,\nwhether for good or for ill, Levin could not choose but remain; he must\nfind out what the man was like whom she loved.",
      "There are people who, on meeting a successful rival, no matter in what,\nare at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him, and\nto see only what is bad.",
      "There are people, on the other hand, who\ndesire above all to find in that lucky rival the qualities by which he\nhas outstripped them, and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what\nis good.",
      "Levin belonged to the second class.",
      "But he had no difficulty\nin finding what was good and attractive in Vronsky.",
      "It was apparent at\nthe first glance.",
      "Vronsky was a squarely built, dark man, not very\ntall, with a good-humored, handsome, and exceedingly calm and resolute\nface.",
      "Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped\nblack hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting,\nbrand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant.",
      "Making way\nfor the lady who had come in, Vronsky went up to the princess and then\nto Kitty.",
      "As he approached her, his beautiful eyes shone with a specially tender\nlight, and with a faint, happy, and modestly triumphant smile (so it\nseemed to Levin), bowing carefully and respectfully over her, he held\nout his small broad hand to her.",
      "Greeting and saying a few words to everyone, he sat down without once\nglancing at Levin, who had never taken his eyes off him.",
      "Let me introduce you,  said the princess, indicating Levin.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky got up and, looking cordially at Levin, shook hands with him.",
      "I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,  he said, smiling\nhis simple and open smile;  but you had unexpectedly left for the\ncountry.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople, \nsaid Countess Nordston.",
      "My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them\nso well,  said Levin, and, suddenly conscious that he had said just the\nsame thing before, he reddened.",
      "Vronsky looked at Levin and Countess Nordston, and smiled.",
      "Are you always in the country?",
      "he inquired.",
      "I should think it must\nbe dull in the winter.",
      "It s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one s not dull by\noneself,  Levin replied abruptly.",
      "I am fond of the country,  said Vronsky, noticing, and affecting not\nto notice, Levin s tone.",
      "But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country\nalways,  said Countess Nordston.",
      "I don t know; I have never tried for long.",
      "I experienced a queer\nfeeling once,  he went on.",
      "I never longed so for the country, Russian\ncountry, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter\nwith my mother in Nice.",
      "Nice itself is dull enough, you know.",
      "And\nindeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time.",
      "And\nit s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and\nespecially the country.",
      "It s as though....",
      "He talked on, addressing both Kitty and Levin, turning his serene,\nfriendly eyes from one to the other, and saying obviously just what\ncame into his head.",
      "Noticing that Countess Nordston wanted to say something, he stopped\nshort without finishing what he had begun, and listened attentively to\nher.",
      "The conversation did not flag for an instant, so that the princess, who\nalways kept in reserve, in case a subject should be lacking, two heavy\nguns the relative advantages of classical and of modern education, and\nuniversal military service had not to move out either of them, while\nCountess Nordston had not a chance of chaffing Levin.",
      "Levin wanted to, and could not, take part in the general conversation;\nsaying to himself every instant,  Now go,  he still did not go, as\nthough waiting for something.",
      "The conversation fell upon table-turning and spirits, and Countess\nNordston, who believed in spiritualism, began to describe the marvels\nshe had seen.",
      "Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity s sake do take me to\nsee them!",
      "I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always\non the lookout for it everywhere,  said Vronsky, smiling.",
      "Very well, next Saturday,  answered Countess Nordston.",
      "But you,\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?",
      "she asked Levin.",
      "Why do you ask me?",
      "You know what I shall say.",
      "But I want to hear your opinion.",
      "My opinion,  answered Levin,  is only that this table-turning simply\nproves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants.",
      "They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while\nwe.... \n\n Oh, then you don t believe in it?",
      "I can t believe in it, countess.",
      "But if I ve seen it myself?",
      "The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.",
      "Then you think I tell a lie?",
      "And she laughed a mirthless laugh.",
      "Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in\nit,  said Kitty, blushing for Levin, and Levin saw this, and, still\nmore exasperated, would have answered, but Vronsky with his bright\nfrank smile rushed to the support of the conversation, which was\nthreatening to become disagreeable.",
      "You do not admit the conceivability at all?",
      "he queried.",
      "But why not?",
      "We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing.",
      "Why\nshould there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which....",
      "When electricity was discovered,  Levin interrupted hurriedly,  it was\nonly the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what\nit proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its\napplications were conceived.",
      "But the spiritualists have begun with\ntables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only\nlater started saying that it is an unknown force.",
      "Vronsky listened attentively to Levin, as he always did listen,\nobviously interested in his words.",
      "Yes, but the spiritualists say we don t know at present what this\nforce is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which\nit acts.",
      "Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.",
      "No, I don t see why there should not be a new force, if it.... \n\n Why, because with electricity,  Levin interrupted again,  every time\nyou rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in\nthis case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a\nnatural phenomenon.",
      "Feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious\nfor a drawing-room, Vronsky made no rejoinder, but by way of trying to\nchange the conversation, he smiled brightly, and turned to the ladies.",
      "Do let us try at once, countess,  he said; but Levin would finish\nsaying what he thought.",
      "I think,  he went on,  that this attempt of the spiritualists to\nexplain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.",
      "They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to\nmaterial experiment.",
      "Everyone was waiting for him to finish, and he felt it.",
      "And I think you would be a first-rate medium,  said Countess Nordston;\n there s something enthusiastic in you.",
      "Levin opened his mouth, was about to say something, reddened, and said\nnothing.",
      "Do let us try table-turning at once, please,  said Vronsky.",
      "Princess,\nwill you allow it?",
      "And Vronsky stood up, looking for a little table.",
      "Kitty got up to fetch a table, and as she passed, her eyes met Levin s.\nShe felt for him with her whole heart, the more because she was pitying\nhim for suffering of which she was herself the cause.",
      "If you can\nforgive me, forgive me,  said her eyes,  I am so happy.",
      "I hate them all, and you, and myself,  his eyes responded, and he took\nup his hat.",
      "But he was not destined to escape.",
      "Just as they were\narranging themselves round the table, and Levin was on the point of\nretiring, the old prince came in, and after greeting the ladies,\naddressed Levin.",
      "Ah!",
      "he began joyously.",
      "Been here long, my boy?",
      "I didn t even know\nyou were in town.",
      "Very glad to see you.",
      "The old prince embraced Levin,\nand talking to him did not observe Vronsky, who had risen, and was\nserenely waiting till the prince should turn to him.",
      "Kitty felt how distasteful her father s warmth was to Levin after what\nhad happened.",
      "She saw, too, how coldly her father responded at last to\nVronsky s bow, and how Vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her\nfather, as though trying and failing to understand how and why anyone\ncould be hostilely disposed towards him, and she flushed.",
      "Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  said Countess Nordston;\n we want to try an experiment.",
      "What experiment?",
      "Table-turning?",
      "Well, you must excuse me, ladies and\ngentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,  said\nthe old prince, looking at Vronsky, and guessing that it had been his\nsuggestion.",
      "There s some sense in that, anyway.",
      "Vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his resolute eyes, and,\nwith a faint smile, began immediately talking to Countess Nordston of\nthe great ball that was to come off next week.",
      "I hope you will be there?",
      "he said to Kitty.",
      "As soon as the old prince\nturned away from him, Levin went out unnoticed, and the last impression\nhe carried away with him of that evening was the smiling, happy face of\nKitty answering Vronsky s inquiry about the ball.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nAt the end of the evening Kitty told her mother of her conversation\nwith Levin, and in spite of all the pity she felt for Levin, she was\nglad at the thought that she had received an _offer_.",
      "She had no doubt\nthat she had acted rightly.",
      "But after she had gone to bed, for a long\nwhile she could not sleep.",
      "One impression pursued her relentlessly.",
      "It\nwas Levin s face, with his scowling brows, and his kind eyes looking\nout in dark dejection below them, as he stood listening to her father,\nand glancing at her and at Vronsky.",
      "And she felt so sorry for him that\ntears came into her eyes.",
      "But immediately she thought of the man for\nwhom she had given him up.",
      "She vividly recalled his manly, resolute\nface, his noble self-possession, and the good nature conspicuous in\neverything towards everyone.",
      "She remembered the love for her of the man\nshe loved, and once more all was gladness in her soul, and she lay on\nthe pillow, smiling with happiness.",
      "I m sorry, I m sorry; but what\ncould I do?",
      "It s not my fault,  she said to herself; but an inner voice\ntold her something else.",
      "Whether she felt remorse at having won Levin s\nlove, or at having refused him, she did not know.",
      "But her happiness was\npoisoned by doubts.",
      "Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us;\nLord, have pity on us!",
      "she repeated to herself, till she fell asleep.",
      "Meanwhile there took place below, in the prince s little library, one\nof the scenes so often repeated between the parents on account of their\nfavorite daughter.",
      "What?",
      "I ll tell you what!",
      "shouted the prince, waving his arms, and at\nonce wrapping his squirrel-lined dressing-gown round him again.",
      "That\nyou ve no pride, no dignity; that you re disgracing, ruining your\ndaughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!",
      "But, really, for mercy s sake, prince, what have I done?",
      "said the\nprincess, almost crying.",
      "She, pleased and happy after her conversation with her daughter, had\ngone to the prince to say good-night as usual, and though she had no\nintention of telling him of Levin s offer and Kitty s refusal, still\nshe hinted to her husband that she fancied things were practically\nsettled with Vronsky, and that he would declare himself so soon as his\nmother arrived.",
      "And thereupon, at those words, the prince had all at\nonce flown into a passion, and began to use unseemly language.",
      "What have you done?",
      "I ll tell you what.",
      "First of all, you re trying to\ncatch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and\nwith good reason.",
      "If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don t\npick out the possible suitors.",
      "Invite all the young bucks.",
      "Engage a\npiano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays,\nhunting up good matches.",
      "It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you ve\ngone on till you ve turned the poor wench s head.",
      "Levin s a thousand\ntimes the better man.",
      "As for this little Petersburg swell, they re\nturned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.",
      "But if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after\nanyone.",
      "But what have I done?",
      "Why, you ve....",
      "The prince was crying wrathfully.",
      "I know if one were to listen to you,  interrupted the princess,  we\nshould never marry our daughter.",
      "If it s to be so, we d better go into\nthe country.",
      "Well, and we had better.",
      "But do wait a minute.",
      "Do I try and catch them?",
      "I don t try to catch\nthem in the least.",
      "A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love\nwith her, and she, I fancy.... \n\n Oh, yes, you fancy!",
      "And how if she really is in love, and he s no more\nthinking of marriage than I am!...",
      "Oh, that I should live to see it!",
      "Ah!",
      "spiritualism!",
      "Ah!",
      "Nice!",
      "Ah!",
      "the ball!",
      "And the prince, imagining\nthat he was mimicking his wife, made a mincing curtsey at each word.",
      "And this is how we re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she s\nreally got the notion into her head....",
      "But what makes you suppose so?",
      "I don t suppose; I know.",
      "We have eyes for such things, though\nwomen-folk haven t. I see a man who has serious intentions, that s\nLevin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who s only amusing\nhimself.",
      "Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...",
      "Well, you ll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.",
      "Well, well, we won t talk of it,  the princess stopped him,\nrecollecting her unlucky Dolly.",
      "By all means, and good-night!",
      "And signing each other with the cross, the husband and wife parted with\na kiss, feeling that they each remained of their own opinion.",
      "The princess had at first been quite certain that that evening had\nsettled Kitty s future, and that there could be no doubt of Vronsky s\nintentions, but her husband s words had disturbed her.",
      "And returning to\nher own room, in terror before the unknown future, she, too, like\nKitty, repeated several times in her heart,  Lord, have pity; Lord,\nhave pity; Lord, have pity.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nVronsky had never had a real home life.",
      "His mother had been in her\nyouth a brilliant society woman, who had had during her married life,\nand still more afterwards, many love affairs notorious in the whole\nfashionable world.",
      "His father he scarcely remembered, and he had been\neducated in the Corps of Pages.",
      "Leaving the school very young as a brilliant officer, he had at once\ngot into the circle of wealthy Petersburg army men.",
      "Although he did go\nmore or less into Petersburg society, his love affairs had always\nhitherto been outside it.",
      "In Moscow he had for the first time felt, after his luxurious and\ncoarse life at Petersburg, all the charm of intimacy with a sweet and\ninnocent girl of his own rank, who cared for him.",
      "It never even entered\nhis head that there could be any harm in his relations with Kitty.",
      "At\nballs he danced principally with her.",
      "He was a constant visitor at\ntheir house.",
      "He talked to her as people commonly do talk in society all\nsorts of nonsense, but nonsense to which he could not help attaching a\nspecial meaning in her case.",
      "Although he said nothing to her that he\ncould not have said before everybody, he felt that she was becoming\nmore and more dependent upon him, and the more he felt this, the better\nhe liked it, and the tenderer was his feeling for her.",
      "He did not know\nthat his mode of behavior in relation to Kitty had a definite\ncharacter, that it is courting young girls with no intention of\nmarriage, and that such courting is one of the evil actions common\namong brilliant young men such as he was.",
      "It seemed to him that he was\nthe first who had discovered this pleasure, and he was enjoying his\ndiscovery.",
      "If he could have heard what her parents were saying that evening, if he\ncould have put himself at the point of view of the family and have\nheard that Kitty would be unhappy if he did not marry her, he would\nhave been greatly astonished, and would not have believed it.",
      "He could\nnot believe that what gave such great and delicate pleasure to him, and\nabove all to her, could be wrong.",
      "Still less could he have believed\nthat he ought to marry.",
      "Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility.",
      "He not\nonly disliked family life, but a family, and especially a husband was,\nin accordance with the views general in the bachelor world in which he\nlived, conceived as something alien, repellant, and, above all,\nridiculous.",
      "But though Vronsky had not the least suspicion what the parents were\nsaying, he felt on coming away from the Shtcherbatskys  that the secret\nspiritual bond which existed between him and Kitty had grown so much\nstronger that evening that some step must be taken.",
      "But what step could\nand ought to be taken he could not imagine.",
      "What is so exquisite,  he thought, as he returned from the\nShtcherbatskys , carrying away with him, as he always did, a delicious\nfeeling of purity and freshness, arising partly from the fact that he\nhad not been smoking for a whole evening, and with it a new feeling of\ntenderness at her love for him what is so exquisite is that not a word\nhas been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in\nthis unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly\nthan ever she told me she loves me.",
      "And how secretly, simply, and most\nof all, how trustfully!",
      "I feel myself better, purer.",
      "I feel that I have\na heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me.",
      "Those sweet,\nloving eyes!",
      "When she said:  Indeed I do.... \n\n Well, what then?",
      "Oh, nothing.",
      "It s good for me, and good for her.",
      "And\nhe began wondering where to finish the evening.",
      "He passed in review of the places he might go to.",
      "Club?",
      "a game of\nbezique, champagne with Ignatov?",
      "No, I m not going.",
      "_Ch teau des\nFleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan.",
      "No, I m sick\nof it.",
      "That s why I like the Shtcherbatskys , that I m growing better.",
      "I ll go home.",
      "He went straight to his room at Dussots  Hotel, ordered\nsupper, and then undressed, and as soon as his head touched the pillow,\nfell into a sound sleep.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nNext day at eleven o clock in the morning Vronsky drove to the station\nof the Petersburg railway to meet his mother, and the first person he\ncame across on the great flight of steps was Oblonsky, who was\nexpecting his sister by the same train.",
      "Ah!",
      "your excellency!",
      "cried Oblonsky,  whom are you meeting?",
      "My mother,  Vronsky responded, smiling, as everyone did who met\nOblonsky.",
      "He shook hands with him, and together they ascended the\nsteps.",
      "She is to be here from Petersburg today.",
      "I was looking out for you till two o clock last night.",
      "Where did you\ngo after the Shtcherbatskys ?",
      "Home,  answered Vronsky.",
      "I must own I felt so well content yesterday\nafter the Shtcherbatskys  that I didn t care to go anywhere.",
      "I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,\n\nAnd by his eyes I know a youth in love, \n\n\n\ndeclaimed Stepan Arkadyevitch, just as he had done before to Levin.",
      "Vronsky smiled with a look that seemed to say that he did not deny it,\nbut he promptly changed the subject.",
      "And whom are you meeting?",
      "he asked.",
      "I?",
      "I ve come to meet a pretty woman,  said Oblonsky.",
      "You don t say so!",
      "_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.",
      "Ah!",
      "that s Madame Karenina,  said Vronsky.",
      "You know her, no doubt?",
      "I think I do.",
      "Or perhaps not ...",
      "I really am not sure,  Vronsky\nanswered heedlessly, with a vague recollection of something stiff and\ntedious evoked by the name Karenina.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely\nmust know.",
      "All the world knows him.",
      "I know him by reputation and by sight.",
      "I know that he s clever,\nlearned, religious somewhat....",
      "But you know that s not ... _not in my\nline,_  said Vronsky in English.",
      "Yes, he s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid\nman,  observed Stepan Arkadyevitch,  a splendid man.",
      "Oh, well, so much the better for him,  said Vronsky smiling.",
      "Oh,\nyou ve come,  he said, addressing a tall old footman of his mother s,\nstanding at the door;  come here.",
      "Besides the charm Oblonsky had in general for everyone, Vronsky had\nfelt of late specially drawn to him by the fact that in his imagination\nhe was associated with Kitty.",
      "Well, what do you say?",
      "Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the\n_diva?_  he said to him with a smile, taking his arm.",
      "Of course.",
      "I m collecting subscriptions.",
      "Oh, did you make the\nacquaintance of my friend Levin?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Yes; but he left rather early.",
      "He s a capital fellow,  pursued Oblonsky.",
      "Isn t he?",
      "I don t know why it is,  responded Vronsky,  in all Moscow\npeople present company of course excepted,  he put in jestingly,\n there s something uncompromising.",
      "They are all on the defensive, lose\ntheir tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something....",
      "Yes, that s true, it is so,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing\ngood-humoredly.",
      "Will the train soon be in?",
      "Vronsky asked a railway official.",
      "The train s signaled,  answered the man.",
      "The approach of the train was more and more evident by the preparatory\nbustle in the station, the rush of porters, the movement of policemen\nand attendants, and people meeting the train.",
      "Through the frosty vapor\ncould be seen workmen in short sheepskins and soft felt boots crossing\nthe rails of the curving line.",
      "The hiss of the boiler could be heard on\nthe distant rails, and the rumble of something heavy.",
      "No,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who felt a great inclination to tell\nVronsky of Levin s intentions in regard to Kitty.",
      "No, you ve not got a\ntrue impression of Levin.",
      "He s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out\nof humor, it s true, but then he is often very nice.",
      "He s such a true,\nhonest nature, and a heart of gold.",
      "But yesterday there were special\nreasons,  pursued Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a meaning smile, totally\noblivious of the genuine sympathy he had felt the day before for his\nfriend, and feeling the same sympathy now, only for Vronsky.",
      "Yes,\nthere were reasons why he could not help being either particularly\nhappy or particularly unhappy.",
      "Vronsky stood still and asked directly:  How so?",
      "Do you mean he made\nyour _belle-s ur_ an offer yesterday?",
      "Maybe,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I fancied something of the sort\nyesterday.",
      "Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it\nmust mean it....",
      "He s been so long in love, and I m very sorry for\nhim.",
      "So that s it!",
      "I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better\nmatch,  said Vronsky, drawing himself up and walking about again,\n though I don t know him, of course,  he added.",
      "Yes, that is a hateful\nposition!",
      "That s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras.",
      "If\nyou don t succeed with them it only proves that you ve not enough cash,\nbut in this case one s dignity s at stake.",
      "But here s the train.",
      "The engine had already whistled in the distance.",
      "A few instants later\nthe platform was quivering, and with puffs of steam hanging low in the\nair from the frost, the engine rolled up, with the lever of the middle\nwheel rhythmically moving up and down, and the stooping figure of the\nengine-driver covered with frost.",
      "Behind the tender, setting the\nplatform more and more slowly swaying, came the luggage van with a dog\nwhining in it.",
      "At last the passenger carriages rolled in, oscillating\nbefore coming to a standstill.",
      "A smart guard jumped out, giving a whistle, and after him one by one\nthe impatient passengers began to get down: an officer of the guards,\nholding himself erect, and looking severely about him; a nimble little\nmerchant with a satchel, smiling gaily; a peasant with a sack over his\nshoulder.",
      "Vronsky, standing beside Oblonsky, watched the carriages and the\npassengers, totally oblivious of his mother.",
      "What he had just heard\nabout Kitty excited and delighted him.",
      "Unconsciously he arched his\nchest, and his eyes flashed.",
      "He felt himself a conqueror.",
      "Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,  said the smart guard,\ngoing up to Vronsky.",
      "The guard s words roused him, and forced him to think of his mother and\nhis approaching meeting with her.",
      "He did not in his heart respect his\nmother, and without acknowledging it to himself, he did not love her,\nthough in accordance with the ideas of the set in which he lived, and\nwith his own education, he could not have conceived of any behavior to\nhis mother not in the highest degree respectful and obedient, and the\nmore externally obedient and respectful his behavior, the less in his\nheart he respected and loved her.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nVronsky followed the guard to the carriage, and at the door of the\ncompartment he stopped short to make room for a lady who was getting\nout.",
      "With the insight of a man of the world, from one glance at this lady s\nappearance Vronsky classified her as belonging to the best society.",
      "He\nbegged pardon, and was getting into the carriage, but felt he must\nglance at her once more; not that she was very beautiful, not on\naccount of the elegance and modest grace which were apparent in her\nwhole figure, but because in the expression of her charming face, as\nshe passed close by him, there was something peculiarly caressing and\nsoft.",
      "As he looked round, she too turned her head.",
      "Her shining gray\neyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly\nattention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then\npromptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone.",
      "In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness\nwhich played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and\nthe faint smile that curved her red lips.",
      "It was as though her nature\nwere so brimming over with something that against her will it showed\nitself now in the flash of her eyes, and now in her smile.",
      "Deliberately\nshe shrouded the light in her eyes, but it shone against her will in\nthe faintly perceptible smile.",
      "Vronsky stepped into the carriage.",
      "His mother, a dried-up old lady with\nblack eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and\nsmiled slightly with her thin lips.",
      "Getting up from the seat and\nhanding her maid a bag, she gave her little wrinkled hand to her son to\nkiss, and lifting his head from her hand, kissed him on the cheek.",
      "You got my telegram?",
      "Quite well?",
      "Thank God.",
      "You had a good journey?",
      "said her son, sitting down beside her, and\ninvoluntarily listening to a woman s voice outside the door.",
      "He knew it\nwas the voice of the lady he had met at the door.",
      "All the same I don t agree with you,  said the lady s voice.",
      "It s the Petersburg view, madame.",
      "Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,  she responded.",
      "Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.",
      "Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch.",
      "And could you see if my brother is here,\nand send him to me?",
      "said the lady in the doorway, and stepped back\nagain into the compartment.",
      "Well, have you found your brother?",
      "said Countess Vronskaya,\naddressing the lady.",
      "Vronsky understood now that this was Madame Karenina.",
      "Your brother is here,  he said, standing up.",
      "Excuse me, I did not\nknow you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,  said Vronsky,\nbowing,  that no doubt you do not remember me.",
      "Oh, no,  said she,  I should have known you because your mother and I\nhave been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.",
      "As she\nspoke she let the eagerness that would insist on coming out show itself\nin her smile.",
      "And still no sign of my brother.",
      "Do call him, Alexey,  said the old countess.",
      "Vronsky stepped out onto\nthe platform and shouted:\n\n Oblonsky!",
      "Here!",
      "Madame Karenina, however, did not wait for her brother, but catching\nsight of him she stepped out with her light, resolute step.",
      "And as soon\nas her brother had reached her, with a gesture that struck Vronsky by\nits decision and its grace, she flung her left arm around his neck,\ndrew him rapidly to her, and kissed him warmly.",
      "Vronsky gazed, never\ntaking his eyes from her, and smiled, he could not have said why.",
      "But\nrecollecting that his mother was waiting for him, he went back again\ninto the carriage.",
      "She s very sweet, isn t she?",
      "said the countess of Madame Karenina.",
      "Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her.",
      "We ve\nbeen talking all the way.",
      "And so you, I hear ... _vous filez le parfait\namour.",
      "Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux._ \n\n I don t know what you are referring to, maman,  he answered coldly.",
      "Come, maman, let us go.",
      "Madame Karenina entered the carriage again to say good-bye to the\ncountess.",
      "Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,  she said.",
      "And all my gossip is exhausted.",
      "I should have nothing more to tell\nyou.",
      "Oh, no,  said the countess, taking her hand.",
      "I could go all around\nthe world with you and never be dull.",
      "You are one of those delightful\nwomen in whose company it s sweet to be silent as well as to talk.",
      "Now\nplease don t fret over your son; you can t expect never to be parted.",
      "Madame Karenina stood quite still, holding herself very erect, and her\neyes were smiling.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna,  the countess said in explanation to her son,  has a\nlittle son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted\nfrom him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.",
      "Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son\nand she of hers,  said Madame Karenina, and again a smile lighted up\nher face, a caressing smile intended for him.",
      "I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,  he said,\npromptly catching the ball of coquetry she had flung him.",
      "But\napparently she did not care to pursue the conversation in that strain,\nand she turned to the old countess.",
      "Thank you so much.",
      "The time has passed so quickly.",
      "Good-bye,\ncountess.",
      "Good-bye, my love,  answered the countess.",
      "Let me have a kiss of your\npretty face.",
      "I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that\nI ve lost my heart to you.",
      "Stereotyped as the phrase was, Madame Karenina obviously believed it\nand was delighted by it.",
      "She flushed, bent down slightly, and put her\ncheek to the countess s lips, drew herself up again, and with the same\nsmile fluttering between her lips and her eyes, she gave her hand to\nVronsky.",
      "He pressed the little hand she gave him, and was delighted, as\nthough at something special, by the energetic squeeze with which she\nfreely and vigorously shook his hand.",
      "She went out with the rapid step\nwhich bore her rather fully-developed figure with such strange\nlightness.",
      "Very charming,  said the countess.",
      "That was just what her son was thinking.",
      "His eyes followed her till her\ngraceful figure was out of sight, and then the smile remained on his\nface.",
      "He saw out of the window how she went up to her brother, put her\narm in his, and began telling him something eagerly, obviously\nsomething that had nothing to do with him, Vronsky, and at that he felt\nannoyed.",
      "Well, maman, are you perfectly well?",
      "he repeated, turning to his\nmother.",
      "Everything has been delightful.",
      "Alexander has been very good, and\nMarie has grown very pretty.",
      "She s very interesting.",
      "And she began telling him again of what interested her most the\nchristening of her grandson, for which she had been staying in\nPetersburg, and the special favor shown her elder son by the Tsar.",
      "Here s Lavrenty,  said Vronsky, looking out of the window;  now we can\ngo, if you like.",
      "The old butler, who had traveled with the countess, came to the\ncarriage to announce that everything was ready, and the countess got up\nto go.",
      "Come; there s not such a crowd now,  said Vronsky.",
      "The maid took a handbag and the lap dog, the butler and a porter the\nother baggage.",
      "Vronsky gave his mother his arm; but just as they were\ngetting out of the carriage several men ran suddenly by with\npanic-stricken faces.",
      "The station-master, too, ran by in his\nextraordinary colored cap.",
      "Obviously something unusual had happened.",
      "The crowd who had left the train were running back again.",
      "What?...",
      "What?...",
      "Where?...",
      "Flung himself!...",
      "Crushed!...",
      "was heard\namong the crowd.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his sister on his arm,\nturned back.",
      "They too looked scared, and stopped at the carriage door\nto avoid the crowd.",
      "The ladies got in, while Vronsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch followed the\ncrowd to find out details of the disaster.",
      "A guard, either drunk or too much muffled up in the bitter frost, had\nnot heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.",
      "Before Vronsky and Oblonsky came back the ladies heard the facts from\nthe butler.",
      "Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mutilated corpse.",
      "Oblonsky was\nevidently upset.",
      "He frowned and seemed ready to cry.",
      "Ah, how awful!",
      "Ah, Anna, if you had seen it!",
      "Ah, how awful!",
      "he said.",
      "Vronsky did not speak; his handsome face was serious, but perfectly\ncomposed.",
      "Oh, if you had seen it, countess,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And his\nwife was there....",
      "It was awful to see her!...",
      "She flung herself on the\nbody.",
      "They say he was the only support of an immense family.",
      "How\nawful!",
      "Couldn t one do anything for her?",
      "said Madame Karenina in an agitated\nwhisper.",
      "Vronsky glanced at her, and immediately got out of the carriage.",
      "I ll be back directly, maman,  he remarked, turning round in the\ndoorway.",
      "When he came back a few minutes later, Stepan Arkadyevitch was already\nin conversation with the countess about the new singer, while the\ncountess was impatiently looking towards the door, waiting for her son.",
      "Now let us be off,  said Vronsky, coming in.",
      "They went out together.",
      "Vronsky was in front with his mother.",
      "Behind walked Madame Karenina\nwith her brother.",
      "Just as they were going out of the station the\nstation-master overtook Vronsky.",
      "You gave my assistant two hundred roubles.",
      "Would you kindly explain\nfor whose benefit you intend them?",
      "For the widow,  said Vronsky, shrugging his shoulders.",
      "I should have\nthought there was no need to ask.",
      "You gave that?",
      "cried Oblonsky, behind, and, pressing his sister s\nhand, he added:  Very nice, very nice!",
      "Isn t he a splendid fellow?",
      "Good-bye, countess.",
      "And he and his sister stood still, looking for her maid.",
      "When they went out the Vronsky s carriage had already driven away.",
      "People coming in were still talking of what happened.",
      "What a horrible death!",
      "said a gentleman, passing by.",
      "They say he was\ncut in two pieces.",
      "On the contrary, I think it s the easiest instantaneous,  observed\nanother.",
      "How is it they don t take proper precautions?",
      "said a third.",
      "Madame Karenina seated herself in the carriage, and Stepan Arkadyevitch\nsaw with surprise that her lips were quivering, and she was with\ndifficulty restraining her tears.",
      "What is it, Anna?",
      "he asked, when they had driven a few hundred yards.",
      "It s an omen of evil,  she said.",
      "What nonsense!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "You ve come, that s the\nchief thing.",
      "You can t conceive how I m resting my hopes on you.",
      "Have you known Vronsky long?",
      "she asked.",
      "Yes.",
      "You know we re hoping he will marry Kitty.",
      "Yes?",
      "said Anna softly.",
      "Come now, let us talk of you,  she added,\ntossing her head, as though she would physically shake off something\nsuperfluous oppressing her.",
      "Let us talk of your affairs.",
      "I got your\nletter, and here I am.",
      "Yes, all my hopes are in you,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, tell me all about it.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch began to tell his story.",
      "On reaching home Oblonsky helped his sister out, sighed, pressed her\nhand, and set off to his office.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nWhen Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little\ndrawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his\nfather, giving him a lesson in French reading.",
      "As the boy read, he kept\ntwisting and trying to tear off a button that was nearly off his\njacket.",
      "His mother had several times taken his hand from it, but the\nfat little hand went back to the button again.",
      "His mother pulled the\nbutton off and put it in her pocket.",
      "Keep your hands still, Grisha,  she said, and she took up her work, a\ncoverlet she had long been making.",
      "She always set to work on it at\ndepressed moments, and now she knitted at it nervously, twitching her\nfingers and counting the stitches.",
      "Though she had sent word the day\nbefore to her husband that it was nothing to her whether his sister\ncame or not, she had made everything ready for her arrival, and was\nexpecting her sister-in-law with emotion.",
      "Dolly was crushed by her sorrow, utterly swallowed up by it.",
      "Still she\ndid not forget that Anna, her sister-in-law, was the wife of one of the\nmost important personages in Petersburg, and was a Petersburg _grande\ndame_.",
      "And, thanks to this circumstance, she did not carry out her\nthreat to her husband that is to say, she remembered that her\nsister-in-law was coming.",
      "And, after all, Anna is in no wise to\nblame,  thought Dolly.",
      "I know nothing of her except the very best, and\nI have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards\nmyself.",
      "It was true that as far as she could recall her impressions at\nPetersburg at the Karenins , she did not like their household itself;\nthere was something artificial in the whole framework of their family\nlife.",
      "But why should I not receive her?",
      "If only she doesn t take it\ninto her head to console me!",
      "thought Dolly.",
      "All consolation and\ncounsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a\nthousand times, and it s all no use.",
      "All these days Dolly had been alone with her children.",
      "She did not want\nto talk of her sorrow, but with that sorrow in her heart she could not\ntalk of outside matters.",
      "She knew that in one way or another she would\ntell Anna everything, and she was alternately glad at the thought of\nspeaking freely, and angry at the necessity of speaking of her\nhumiliation with her, his sister, and of hearing her ready-made phrases\nof good advice and comfort.",
      "She had been on the lookout for her,\nglancing at her watch every minute, and, as so often happens, let slip\njust that minute when her visitor arrived, so that she did not hear the\nbell.",
      "Catching a sound of skirts and light steps at the door, she looked\nround, and her care-worn face unconsciously expressed not gladness, but\nwonder.",
      "She got up and embraced her sister-in-law.",
      "What, here already!",
      "she said as she kissed her.",
      "Dolly, how glad I am to see you!",
      "I am glad, too,  said Dolly, faintly smiling, and trying by the\nexpression of Anna s face to find out whether she knew.",
      "Most likely\nshe knows,  she thought, noticing the sympathy in Anna s face.",
      "Well,\ncome along, I ll take you to your room,  she went on, trying to defer\nas long as possible the moment of confidences.",
      "Is this Grisha?",
      "Heavens, how he s grown!",
      "said Anna; and kissing him,\nnever taking her eyes off Dolly, she stood still and flushed a little.",
      "No, please, let us stay here.",
      "She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her\nblack hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook\nher hair down.",
      "You are radiant with health and happiness!",
      "said Dolly, almost with\nenvy.",
      "I?...",
      "Yes,  said Anna.",
      "Merciful heavens, Tanya!",
      "You re the same age\nas my Seryozha,  she added, addressing the little girl as she ran in.",
      "She took her in her arms and kissed her.",
      "Delightful child, delightful!",
      "Show me them all.",
      "She mentioned them, not only remembering the names, but the years,\nmonths, characters, illnesses of all the children, and Dolly could not\nbut appreciate that.",
      "Very well, we will go to them,  she said.",
      "It s a pity Vassya s\nasleep.",
      "After seeing the children, they sat down, alone now, in the\ndrawing-room, to coffee.",
      "Anna took the tray, and then pushed it away\nfrom her.",
      "Dolly,  she said,  he has told me.",
      "Dolly looked coldly at Anna; she was waiting now for phrases of\nconventional sympathy, but Anna said nothing of the sort.",
      "Dolly, dear,  she said,  I don t want to speak for him to you, nor to\ntry to comfort you; that s impossible.",
      "But, darling, I m simply sorry,\nsorry from my heart for you!",
      "Under the thick lashes of her shining eyes tears suddenly glittered.",
      "She moved nearer to her sister-in-law and took her hand in her vigorous\nlittle hand.",
      "Dolly did not shrink away, but her face did not lose its\nfrigid expression.",
      "She said:\n\n To comfort me s impossible.",
      "Everything s lost after what has happened,\neverything s over!",
      "And directly she had said this, her face suddenly softened.",
      "Anna lifted\nthe wasted, thin hand of Dolly, kissed it and said:\n\n But, Dolly, what s to be done, what s to be done?",
      "How is it best to\nact in this awful position that s what you must think of.",
      "All s over, and there s nothing more,  said Dolly.",
      "And the worst of\nall is, you see, that I can t cast him off: there are the children, I\nam tied.",
      "And I can t live with him!",
      "it s a torture to me to see him.",
      "Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you:\ntell me about it.",
      "Dolly looked at her inquiringly.",
      "Sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on Anna s face.",
      "Very well,  she said all at once.",
      "But I will tell you it from the\nbeginning.",
      "You know how I was married.",
      "With the education mamma gave us\nI was more than innocent, I was stupid.",
      "I knew nothing.",
      "I know they say\nmen tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva she corrected\nherself Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing.",
      "You ll hardly believe it,\nbut till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known.",
      "So I\nlived eight years.",
      "You must understand that I was so far from\nsuspecting infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then try to\nimagine it with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all\nthe loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me.",
      "To be fully\nconvinced of one s happiness, and all at once....  continued Dolly,\nholding back her sobs,  to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress,\nmy governess.",
      "No, it s too awful!",
      "She hastily pulled out her\nhandkerchief and hid her face in it.",
      "I can understand being carried\naway by feeling,  she went on after a brief silence,  but deliberately,\nslyly deceiving me ... and with whom?...",
      "To go on being my husband\ntogether with her ... it s awful!",
      "You can t understand.... \n\n Oh, yes, I understand!",
      "I understand!",
      "Dolly, dearest, I do understand, \nsaid Anna, pressing her hand.",
      "And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?",
      "Dolly resumed.",
      "Not the slightest!",
      "He s happy and contented.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "Anna interposed quickly.",
      "He s to be pitied, he s weighed\ndown by remorse.... \n\n Is he capable of remorse?",
      "Dolly interrupted, gazing intently into her\nsister-in-law s face.",
      "Yes.",
      "I know him.",
      "I could not look at him without feeling sorry for\nhim.",
      "We both know him.",
      "He s good-hearted, but he s proud, and now he s\nso humiliated.",
      "What touched me most....  (and here Anna guessed what\nwould touch Dolly most)  he s tortured by two things: that he s ashamed\nfor the children s sake, and that, loving you yes, yes, loving you\nbeyond everything on earth,  she hurriedly interrupted Dolly, who would\nhave answered he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart.",
      "No, no, she\ncannot forgive me,  he keeps saying.",
      "Dolly looked dreamily away beyond her sister-in-law as she listened to\nher words.",
      "Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it s worse for the guilty\nthan the innocent,  she said,  if he feels that all the misery comes\nfrom his fault.",
      "But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife\nagain after her?",
      "For me to live with him now would be torture, just\nbecause I love my past love for him.... \n\nAnd sobs cut short her words.",
      "But as though of set design, each time\nshe was softened she began to speak again of what exasperated her.",
      "She s young, you see, she s pretty,  she went on.",
      "Do you know, Anna,\nmy youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom?",
      "By him and his\nchildren.",
      "I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service,\nand now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him.",
      "No\ndoubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent.",
      "Do\nyou understand?",
      "Again her eyes glowed with hatred.",
      "And after that he will tell me.... What!",
      "can I believe him?",
      "Never!",
      "No,\neverything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of\nmy work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching\nGrisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture.",
      "What\nhave I to strive and toil for?",
      "Why are the children here?",
      "What s so\nawful is that all at once my heart s turned, and instead of love and\ntenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred.",
      "I could\nkill him.",
      "Darling Dolly, I understand, but don t torture yourself.",
      "You are so\ndistressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.",
      "Dolly grew calmer, and for two minutes both were silent.",
      "What s to be done?",
      "Think for me, Anna, help me.",
      "I have thought over\neverything, and I see nothing.",
      "Anna could think of nothing, but her heart responded instantly to each\nword, to each change of expression of her sister-in-law.",
      "One thing I would say,  began Anna.",
      "I am his sister, I know his\ncharacter, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything  (she\nwaved her hand before her forehead),  that faculty for being completely\ncarried away, but for completely repenting too.",
      "He cannot believe it,\nhe cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.",
      "No; he understands, he understood!",
      "Dolly broke in.",
      "But I ... you are\nforgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?",
      "Wait a minute.",
      "When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the\nawfulness of your position.",
      "I saw nothing but him, and that the family\nwas broken up.",
      "I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see\nit, as a woman, quite differently.",
      "I see your agony, and I can t tell\nyou how sorry I am for you!",
      "But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your\nsufferings, only there is one thing I don t know; I don t know ...",
      "I\ndon t know how much love there is still in your heart for him.",
      "That you\nknow whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him.",
      "If\nthere is, forgive him!",
      "No,  Dolly was beginning, but Anna cut her short, kissing her hand\nonce more.",
      "I know more of the world than you do,  she said.",
      "I know how men like\nStiva look at it.",
      "You speak of his talking of you with her.",
      "That never\nhappened.",
      "Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred\nto them.",
      "Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt\nby them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family.",
      "They draw\na sort of line that can t be crossed between them and their families.",
      "I\ndon t understand it, but it is so.",
      "Yes, but he has kissed her.... \n\n Dolly, hush, darling.",
      "I saw Stiva when he was in love with you.",
      "I\nremember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all\nthe poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the\nlonger he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes.",
      "You\nknow we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:\n Dolly s a marvelous woman.",
      "You have always been a divinity for him,\nand you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the\nheart....",
      "But if it is repeated?",
      "It cannot be, as I understand it....",
      "Yes, but could you forgive it?",
      "I don t know, I can t judge....",
      "Yes, I can,  said Anna, thinking a\nmoment; and grasping the position in her thought and weighing it in her\ninner balance, she added:  Yes, I can, I can, I can.",
      "Yes, I could\nforgive it.",
      "I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and\nforgive it as though it had never been, never been at all.... \n\n Oh, of course,  Dolly interposed quickly, as though saying what she\nhad more than once thought,  else it would not be forgiveness.",
      "If one\nforgives, it must be completely, completely.",
      "Come, let us go; I ll take\nyou to your room,  she said, getting up, and on the way she embraced\nAnna.",
      "My dear, how glad I am you came.",
      "It has made things better, ever\nso much better.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nThe whole of that day Anna spent at home, that s to say at the\nOblonskys , and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had\nalready heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day.",
      "Anna spent\nthe whole morning with Dolly and the children.",
      "She merely sent a brief\nnote to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.",
      "Come, God is merciful,  she wrote.",
      "Oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,\nspeaking to him, addressed him as  Stiva,  as she had not done before.",
      "In the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still\nremained, but there was no talk now of separation, and Stepan\nArkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.",
      "Immediately after dinner Kitty came in.",
      "She knew Anna Arkadyevna, but\nonly very slightly, and she came now to her sister s with some\ntrepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable Petersburg\nlady, whom everyone spoke so highly of.",
      "But she made a favorable\nimpression on Anna Arkadyevna she saw that at once.",
      "Anna was\nunmistakably admiring her loveliness and her youth: before Kitty knew\nwhere she was she found herself not merely under Anna s sway, but in\nlove with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married\nwomen.",
      "Anna was not like a fashionable lady, nor the mother of a boy of\neight years old.",
      "In the elasticity of her movements, the freshness and\nthe unflagging eagerness which persisted in her face, and broke out in\nher smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of\ntwenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her\neyes, which struck and attracted Kitty.",
      "Kitty felt that Anna was\nperfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another\nhigher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.",
      "After dinner, when Dolly went away to her own room, Anna rose quickly\nand went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.",
      "Stiva,  she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing\ntowards the door,  go, and God help you.",
      "He threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the\ndoorway.",
      "When Stepan Arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa\nwhere she had been sitting, surrounded by the children.",
      "Either because\nthe children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they\nfelt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the\nyounger following their lead, as children so often do, had clung about\ntheir new aunt since before dinner, and would not leave her side.",
      "And\nit had become a sort of game among them to sit as close as possible to\ntheir aunt, to touch her, hold her little hand, kiss it, play with her\nring, or even touch the flounce of her skirt.",
      "Come, come, as we were sitting before,  said Anna Arkadyevna, sitting\ndown in her place.",
      "And again Grisha poked his little face under her arm, and nestled with\nhis head on her gown, beaming with pride and happiness.",
      "And when is your next ball?",
      "she asked Kitty.",
      "Next week, and a splendid ball.",
      "One of those balls where one always\nenjoys oneself.",
      "Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?",
      "Anna said, with\ntender irony.",
      "It s strange, but there are.",
      "At the Bobrishtchevs  one always enjoys\noneself, and at the Nikitins  too, while at the Mezhkovs  it s always\ndull.",
      "Haven t you noticed it?",
      "No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself, \nsaid Anna, and Kitty detected in her eyes that mysterious world which\nwas not open to her.",
      "For me there are some less dull and tiresome.",
      "How can _you_ be dull at a ball?",
      "Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?",
      "inquired Anna.",
      "Kitty perceived that Anna knew what answer would follow.",
      "Because you always look nicer than anyone.",
      "Anna had the faculty of blushing.",
      "She blushed a little, and said:\n\n In the first place it s never so; and secondly, if it were, what\ndifference would it make to me?",
      "Are you coming to this ball?",
      "asked Kitty.",
      "I imagine it won t be possible to avoid going.",
      "Here, take it,  she\nsaid to Tanya, who was pulling the loosely-fitting ring off her white,\nslender-tipped finger.",
      "I shall be so glad if you go.",
      "I should so like to see you at a ball.",
      "Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it s\na pleasure to you ... Grisha, don t pull my hair.",
      "It s untidy enough\nwithout that,  she said, putting up a straying lock, which Grisha had\nbeen playing with.",
      "I imagine you at the ball in lilac.",
      "And why in lilac precisely?",
      "asked Anna, smiling.",
      "Now, children, run\nalong, run along.",
      "Do you hear?",
      "Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,  she\nsaid, tearing the children from her, and sending them off to the\ndining-room.",
      "I know why you press me to come to the ball.",
      "You expect a great deal\nof this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.",
      "How do you know?",
      "Yes.",
      "Oh!",
      "what a happy time you are at,  pursued Anna.",
      "I remember, and I\nknow that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland.",
      "That\nmist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is\njust ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a\npath growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming\nto enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not\nbeen through it?",
      "Kitty smiled without speaking.",
      "But how did she go through it?",
      "How I\nshould like to know all her love story!",
      "thought Kitty, recalling the\nunromantic appearance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, her husband.",
      "I know something.",
      "Stiva told me, and I congratulate you.",
      "I liked him\nso much,  Anna continued.",
      "I met Vronsky at the railway station.",
      "Oh, was he there?",
      "asked Kitty, blushing.",
      "What was it Stiva told\nyou?",
      "Stiva gossiped about it all.",
      "And I should be so glad ...",
      "I traveled\nyesterday with Vronsky s mother,  she went on;  and his mother talked\nwithout a pause of him, he s her favorite.",
      "I know mothers are partial,\nbut.... \n\n What did his mother tell you?",
      "Oh, a great deal!",
      "And I know that he s her favorite; still one can see\nhow chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had\nwanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done\nsomething extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of\nthe water.",
      "He s a hero, in fact,  said Anna, smiling and recollecting\nthe two hundred roubles he had given at the station.",
      "But she did not tell Kitty about the two hundred roubles.",
      "For some\nreason it was disagreeable to her to think of it.",
      "She felt that there\nwas something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought\nnot to have been.",
      "She pressed me very much to go and see her,  Anna went on;  and I\nshall be glad to go to see her tomorrow.",
      "Stiva is staying a long while\nin Dolly s room, thank God,  Anna added, changing the subject, and\ngetting up, Kitty fancied, displeased with something.",
      "No, I m first!",
      "No, I!",
      "screamed the children, who had finished tea,\nrunning up to their Aunt Anna.",
      "All together,  said Anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and\nembraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking\nwith delight.",
      "Chapter 21\n\nDolly came out of her room to the tea of the grown-up people.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch did not come out.",
      "He must have left his wife s room by the\nother door.",
      "I am afraid you ll be cold upstairs,  observed Dolly, addressing Anna;\n I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.",
      "Oh, please, don t trouble about me,  answered Anna, looking intently\ninto Dolly s face, trying to make out whether there had been a\nreconciliation or not.",
      "It will be lighter for you here,  answered her sister-in-law.",
      "I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.",
      "What s the question?",
      "inquired Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out of his\nroom and addressing his wife.",
      "From his tone both Kitty and Anna knew that a reconciliation had taken\nplace.",
      "I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds.",
      "No one\nknows how to do it; I must see to it myself,  answered Dolly addressing\nhim.",
      "God knows whether they are fully reconciled,  thought Anna, hearing\nher tone, cold and composed.",
      "Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,  answered her\nhusband.",
      "Come, I ll do it all, if you like....",
      "Yes, they must be reconciled,  thought Anna.",
      "I know how you do everything,  answered Dolly.",
      "You tell Matvey to do\nwhat can t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle\nof everything,  and her habitual, mocking smile curved the corners of\nDolly s lips as she spoke.",
      "Full, full reconciliation, full,  thought Anna;  thank God!",
      "and\nrejoicing that she was the cause of it, she went up to Dolly and kissed\nher.",
      "Not at all.",
      "Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?",
      "said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, smiling hardly perceptibly, and addressing his wife.",
      "The whole evening Dolly was, as always, a little mocking in her tone to\nher husband, while Stepan Arkadyevitch was happy and cheerful, but not\nso as to seem as though, having been forgiven, he had forgotten his\noffense.",
      "At half-past nine o clock a particularly joyful and pleasant family\nconversation over the tea-table at the Oblonskys  was broken up by an\napparently simple incident.",
      "But this simple incident for some reason\nstruck everyone as strange.",
      "Talking about common acquaintances in\nPetersburg, Anna got up quickly.",
      "She is in my album,  she said;  and, by the way, I ll show you my\nSeryozha,  she added, with a mother s smile of pride.",
      "Towards ten o clock, when she usually said good-night to her son, and\noften before going to a ball put him to bed herself, she felt depressed\nat being so far from him; and whatever she was talking about, she kept\ncoming back in thought to her curly-headed Seryozha.",
      "She longed to look\nat his photograph and talk of him.",
      "Seizing the first pretext, she got\nup, and with her light, resolute step went for her album.",
      "The stairs up\nto her room came out on the landing of the great warm main staircase.",
      "Just as she was leaving the drawing-room, a ring was heard in the hall.",
      "Who can that be?",
      "said Dolly.",
      "It s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it s late, \nobserved Kitty.",
      "Sure to be someone with papers for me,  put in Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "When Anna was passing the top of the staircase, a servant was running\nup to announce the visitor, while the visitor himself was standing\nunder a lamp.",
      "Anna glancing down at once recognized Vronsky, and a\nstrange feeling of pleasure and at the same time of dread of something\nstirred in her heart.",
      "He was standing still, not taking off his coat,\npulling something out of his pocket.",
      "At the instant when she was just\nfacing the stairs, he raised his eyes, caught sight of her, and into\nthe expression of his face there passed a shade of embarrassment and\ndismay.",
      "With a slight inclination of her head she passed, hearing\nbehind her Stepan Arkadyevitch s loud voice calling him to come up, and\nthe quiet, soft, and composed voice of Vronsky refusing.",
      "When Anna returned with the album, he was already gone, and Stepan\nArkadyevitch was telling them that he had called to inquire about the\ndinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who had just arrived.",
      "And nothing would induce him to come up.",
      "What a queer fellow he is!",
      "added Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Kitty blushed.",
      "She thought that she was the only person who knew why he\nhad come, and why he would not come up.",
      "He has been at home,  she\nthought,  and didn t find me, and thought I should be here, but he did\nnot come up because he thought it late, and Anna s here.",
      "All of them looked at each other, saying nothing, and began to look at\nAnna s album.",
      "There was nothing either exceptional or strange in a man s calling at\nhalf-past nine on a friend to inquire details of a proposed dinner\nparty and not coming in, but it seemed strange to all of them.",
      "Above\nall, it seemed strange and not right to Anna.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nThe ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the\ngreat staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen\nin powder and red coats.",
      "From the rooms came a constant, steady hum, as\nfrom a hive, and the rustle of movement; and while on the landing\nbetween trees they gave last touches to their hair and dresses before\nthe mirror, they heard from the ballroom the careful, distinct notes of\nthe fiddles of the orchestra beginning the first waltz.",
      "A little old\nman in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror,\nand diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs,\nand stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know.",
      "A\nbeardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince\nShtcherbatsky called  young bucks,  in an exceedingly open waistcoat,\nstraightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after\nrunning by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille.",
      "As the first\nquadrille had already been given to Vronsky, she had to promise this\nyouth the second.",
      "An officer, buttoning his glove, stood aside in the\ndoorway, and stroking his mustache, admired rosy Kitty.",
      "Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball\nhad cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she\nwalked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip\nas easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the\nminute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment s\nattention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her\nhair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of\nit.",
      "When, just before entering the ballroom, the princess, her mother,\ntried to turn right side out of the ribbon of her sash, Kitty had drawn\nback a little.",
      "She felt that everything must be right of itself, and\ngraceful, and nothing could need setting straight.",
      "It was one of Kitty s best days.",
      "Her dress was not uncomfortable\nanywhere; her lace berthe did not droop anywhere; her rosettes were not\ncrushed nor torn off; her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels\ndid not pinch, but gladdened her feet; and the thick rolls of fair\nchignon kept up on her head as if they were her own hair.",
      "All the three\nbuttons buttoned up without tearing on the long glove that covered her\nhand without concealing its lines.",
      "The black velvet of her locket\nnestled with special softness round her neck.",
      "That velvet was\ndelicious; at home, looking at her neck in the looking-glass, Kitty had\nfelt that that velvet was speaking.",
      "About all the rest there might be a\ndoubt, but the velvet was delicious.",
      "Kitty smiled here too, at the\nball, when she glanced at it in the glass.",
      "Her bare shoulders and arms\ngave Kitty a sense of chill marble, a feeling she particularly liked.",
      "Her eyes sparkled, and her rosy lips could not keep from smiling from\nthe consciousness of her own attractiveness.",
      "She had scarcely entered\nthe ballroom and reached the throng of ladies, all tulle, ribbons,\nlace, and flowers, waiting to be asked to dance Kitty was never one of\nthat throng when she was asked for a waltz, and asked by the best\npartner, the first star in the hierarchy of the ballroom, a renowned\ndirector of dances, a married man, handsome and well-built, Yegorushka\nKorsunsky.",
      "He had only just left the Countess Bonina, with whom he had\ndanced the first half of the waltz, and, scanning his kingdom that is\nto say, a few couples who had started dancing he caught sight of Kitty,\nentering, and flew up to her with that peculiar, easy amble which is\nconfined to directors of balls.",
      "Without even asking her if she cared to\ndance, he put out his arm to encircle her slender waist.",
      "She looked\nround for someone to give her fan to, and their hostess, smiling to\nher, took it.",
      "How nice you ve come in good time,  he said to her, embracing her\nwaist;  such a bad habit to be late.",
      "Bending her left hand, she laid\nit on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began\nswiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in\ntime to the music.",
      "It s a rest to waltz with you,  he said to her, as they fell into the\nfirst slow steps of the waltz.",
      "It s exquisite such lightness,\nprecision.",
      "He said to her the same thing he said to almost all his\npartners whom he knew well.",
      "She smiled at his praise, and continued to look about the room over his\nshoulder.",
      "She was not like a girl at her first ball, for whom all faces\nin the ballroom melt into one vision of fairyland.",
      "And she was not a\ngirl who had gone the stale round of balls till every face in the\nballroom was familiar and tiresome.",
      "But she was in the middle stage\nbetween these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had\nsufficient self-possession to be able to observe.",
      "In the left corner of\nthe ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.",
      "There incredibly naked was the beauty Lidi, Korsunsky s wife; there was\nthe lady of the house; there shone the bald head of Krivin, always to\nbe found where the best people were.",
      "In that direction gazed the young\nmen, not venturing to approach.",
      "There, too, she descried Stiva, and\nthere she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet\ngown.",
      "And _he_ was there.",
      "Kitty had not seen him since the evening she\nrefused Levin.",
      "With her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and\nwas even aware that he was looking at her.",
      "Another turn, eh?",
      "You re not tired?",
      "said Korsunsky, a little out of\nbreath.",
      "No, thank you!",
      "Where shall I take you?",
      "Madame Karenina s here, I think ... take me to her.",
      "Wherever you command.",
      "And Korsunsky began waltzing with measured steps straight towards the\ngroup in the left corner, continually saying,  Pardon, mesdames,\npardon, pardon, mesdames ; and steering his course through the sea of\nlace, tulle, and ribbon, and not disarranging a feather, he turned his\npartner sharply round, so that her slim ankles, in light transparent\nstockings, were exposed to view, and her train floated out in fan shape\nand covered Krivin s knees.",
      "Korsunsky bowed, set straight his open\nshirt front, and gave her his arm to conduct her to Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "Kitty, flushed, took her train from Krivin s knees, and, a little\ngiddy, looked round, seeking Anna.",
      "Anna was not in lilac, as Kitty had\nso urgently wished, but in a black, low-cut, velvet gown, showing her\nfull throat and shoulders, that looked as though carved in old ivory,\nand her rounded arms, with tiny, slender wrists.",
      "The whole gown was\ntrimmed with Venetian guipure.",
      "On her head, among her black hair her\nown, with no false additions was a little wreath of pansies, and a\nbouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace.",
      "Her coiffure was not striking.",
      "All that was noticeable was the little\nwilful tendrils of her curly hair that would always break free about\nher neck and temples.",
      "Round her well-cut, strong neck was a thread of\npearls.",
      "Kitty had been seeing Anna every day; she adored her, and had pictured\nher invariably in lilac.",
      "But now seeing her in black, she felt that she\nhad not fully seen her charm.",
      "She saw her now as someone quite new and\nsurprising to her.",
      "Now she understood that Anna could not have been in\nlilac, and that her charm was just that she always stood out against\nher attire, that her dress could never be noticeable on her.",
      "And her\nblack dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her; it was\nonly the frame, and all that was seen was she simple, natural, elegant,\nand at the same time gay and eager.",
      "She was standing holding herself, as always, very erect, and when Kitty\ndrew near the group she was speaking to the master of the house, her\nhead slightly turned towards him.",
      "No, I don t throw stones,  she was saying, in answer to something,\n though I can t understand it,  she went on, shrugging her shoulders,\nand she turned at once with a soft smile of protection towards Kitty.",
      "With a flying, feminine glance she scanned her attire, and made a\nmovement of her head, hardly perceptible, but understood by Kitty,\nsignifying approval of her dress and her looks.",
      "You came into the room\ndancing,  she added.",
      "This is one of my most faithful supporters,  said Korsunsky, bowing to\nAnna Arkadyevna, whom he had not yet seen.",
      "The princess helps to make\nballs happy and successful.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?",
      "he said, bending\ndown to her.",
      "Why, have you met?",
      "inquired their host.",
      "Is there anyone we have not met?",
      "My wife and I are like white\nwolves everyone knows us,  answered Korsunsky.",
      "A waltz, Anna\nArkadyevna?",
      "I don t dance when it s possible not to dance,  she said.",
      "But tonight it s impossible,  answered Korsunsky.",
      "At that instant Vronsky came up.",
      "Well, since it s impossible tonight, let us start,  she said, not\nnoticing Vronsky s bow, and she hastily put her hand on Korsunsky s\nshoulder.",
      "What is she vexed with him about?",
      "thought Kitty, discerning that Anna\nhad intentionally not responded to Vronsky s bow.",
      "Vronsky went up to\nKitty reminding her of the first quadrille, and expressing his regret\nthat he had not seen her all this time.",
      "Kitty gazed in admiration at\nAnna waltzing, and listened to him.",
      "She expected him to ask her for a\nwaltz, but he did not, and she glanced wonderingly at him.",
      "He flushed\nslightly, and hurriedly asked her to waltz, but he had only just put\nhis arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music\nsuddenly stopped.",
      "Kitty looked into his face, which was so close to her\nown, and long afterwards for several years after that look, full of\nlove, to which he made no response, cut her to the heart with an agony\nof shame.",
      "_Pardon!",
      "pardon!_ Waltz!",
      "waltz!",
      "shouted Korsunsky from the other side\nof the room, and seizing the first young lady he came across he began\ndancing himself.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nVronsky and Kitty waltzed several times round the room.",
      "After the first\nwaltz Kitty went to her mother, and she had hardly time to say a few\nwords to Countess Nordston when Vronsky came up again for the first\nquadrille.",
      "During the quadrille nothing of any significance was said:\nthere was disjointed talk between them of the Korsunskys, husband and\nwife, whom he described very amusingly, as delightful children at\nforty, and of the future town theater; and only once the conversation\ntouched her to the quick, when he asked her about Levin, whether he was\nhere, and added that he liked him so much.",
      "But Kitty did not expect\nmuch from the quadrille.",
      "She looked forward with a thrill at her heart\nto the mazurka.",
      "She fancied that in the mazurka everything must be\ndecided.",
      "The fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the\nmazurka did not trouble her.",
      "She felt sure she would dance the mazurka\nwith him as she had done at former balls, and refused five young men,\nsaying she was engaged for the mazurka.",
      "The whole ball up to the last\nquadrille was for Kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors,\nsounds, and motions.",
      "She only sat down when she felt too tired and\nbegged for a rest.",
      "But as she was dancing the last quadrille with one\nof the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse, she chanced to be\n_vis- -vis_ with Vronsky and Anna.",
      "She had not been near Anna again\nsince the beginning of the evening, and now again she saw her suddenly\nquite new and surprising.",
      "She saw in her the signs of that excitement\nof success she knew so well in herself; she saw that she was\nintoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting.",
      "She knew\nthat feeling and knew its signs, and saw them in Anna; saw the\nquivering, flashing light in her eyes, and the smile of happiness and\nexcitement unconsciously playing on her lips, and the deliberate grace,\nprecision, and lightness of her movements.",
      "Who?",
      "she asked herself.",
      "All or one?",
      "And not assisting the harassed\nyoung man she was dancing with in the conversation, the thread of which\nhe had lost and could not pick up again, she obeyed with external\nliveliness the peremptory shouts of Korsunsky starting them all into\nthe _grand rond_, and then into the _cha ne_, and at the same time she\nkept watch with a growing pang at her heart.",
      "No, it s not the\nadmiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one.",
      "And that one?",
      "can it be he?",
      "Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous\nlight flashed into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red\nlips.",
      "She seemed to make an effort to control herself, to try not to\nshow these signs of delight, but they came out on her face of\nthemselves.",
      "But what of him?",
      "Kitty looked at him and was filled with\nterror.",
      "What was pictured so clearly to Kitty in the mirror of Anna s\nface she saw in him.",
      "What had become of his always self-possessed\nresolute manner, and the carelessly serene expression of his face?",
      "Now\nevery time he turned to her, he bent his head, as though he would have\nfallen at her feet, and in his eyes there was nothing but humble\nsubmission and dread.",
      "I would not offend you,  his eyes seemed every\ntime to be saying,  but I want to save myself, and I don t know how.",
      "On his face was a look such as Kitty had never seen before.",
      "They were speaking of common acquaintances, keeping up the most trivial\nconversation, but to Kitty it seemed that every word they said was\ndetermining their fate and hers.",
      "And strange it was that they were\nactually talking of how absurd Ivan Ivanovitch was with his French, and\nhow the Eletsky girl might have made a better match, yet these words\nhad all the while consequence for them, and they were feeling just as\nKitty did.",
      "The whole ball, the whole world, everything seemed lost in\nfog in Kitty s soul.",
      "Nothing but the stern discipline of her\nbringing-up supported her and forced her to do what was expected of\nher, that is, to dance, to answer questions, to talk, even to smile.",
      "But before the mazurka, when they were beginning to rearrange the\nchairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big\nroom, a moment of despair and horror came for Kitty.",
      "She had refused\nfive partners, and now she was not dancing the mazurka.",
      "She had not\neven a hope of being asked for it, because she was so successful in\nsociety that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained\ndisengaged till now.",
      "She would have to tell her mother she felt ill and\ngo home, but she had not the strength to do this.",
      "She felt crushed.",
      "She\nwent to the furthest end of the little drawing-room and sank into a low\nchair.",
      "Her light, transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her\nslender waist; one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly,\nwas lost in the folds of her pink tunic; in the other she held her fan,\nand with rapid, short strokes fanned her burning face.",
      "But while she\nlooked like a butterfly, clinging to a blade of grass, and just about\nto open its rainbow wings for fresh flight, her heart ached with a\nhorrible despair.",
      "But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?",
      "And again she recalled\nall she had seen.",
      "Kitty, what is it?",
      "said Countess Nordston, stepping noiselessly over\nthe carpet towards her.",
      "I don t understand it.",
      "Kitty s lower lip began to quiver; she got up quickly.",
      "Kitty, you re not dancing the mazurka?",
      "No, no,  said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.",
      "He asked her for the mazurka before me,  said Countess Nordston,\nknowing Kitty would understand who were  he  and  her.",
      "She said:\n Why, aren t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?",
      "Oh, I don t care!",
      "answered Kitty.",
      "No one but she herself understood her position; no one knew that she\nhad just refused the man whom perhaps she loved, and refused him\nbecause she had put her faith in another.",
      "Countess Nordston found Korsunsky, with whom she was to dance the\nmazurka, and told him to ask Kitty.",
      "Kitty danced in the first couple, and luckily for her she had not to\ntalk, because Korsunsky was all the time running about directing the\nfigure.",
      "Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite her.",
      "She saw them with her\nlong-sighted eyes, and saw them, too, close by, when they met in the\nfigures, and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that\nher unhappiness was complete.",
      "She saw that they felt themselves alone\nin that crowded room.",
      "And on Vronsky s face, always so firm and\nindependent, she saw that look that had struck her, of bewilderment and\nhumble submissiveness, like the expression of an intelligent dog when\nit has done wrong.",
      "Anna smiled, and her smile was reflected by him.",
      "She grew thoughtful,\nand he became serious.",
      "Some supernatural force drew Kitty s eyes to\nAnna s face.",
      "She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating\nwere her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck\nwith its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose\nhair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and\nhands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was\nsomething terrible and cruel in her fascination.",
      "Kitty admired her more than ever, and more and more acute was her\nsuffering.",
      "Kitty felt overwhelmed, and her face showed it.",
      "When Vronsky\nsaw her, coming across her in the mazurka, he did not at once recognize\nher, she was so changed.",
      "Delightful ball!",
      "he said to her, for the sake of saying something.",
      "Yes,  she answered.",
      "In the middle of the mazurka, repeating a complicated figure, newly\ninvented by Korsunsky, Anna came forward into the center of the circle,\nchose two gentlemen, and summoned a lady and Kitty.",
      "Kitty gazed at her\nin dismay as she went up.",
      "Anna looked at her with drooping eyelids, and\nsmiled, pressing her hand.",
      "But, noticing that Kitty only responded to\nher smile by a look of despair and amazement, she turned away from her,\nand began gaily talking to the other lady.",
      "Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her, \nKitty said to herself.",
      "Anna did not mean to stay to supper, but the master of the house began\nto press her to do so.",
      "Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,  said Korsunsky, drawing her bare arm under\nthe sleeve of his dress coat,  I ve such an idea for a _cotillion!",
      "Un\nbijou!_ \n\nAnd he moved gradually on, trying to draw her along with him.",
      "Their\nhost smiled approvingly.",
      "No, I am not going to stay,  answered Anna, smiling, but in spite of\nher smile, both Korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her\nresolute tone that she would not stay.",
      "No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I\nhave all the winter in Petersburg,  said Anna, looking round at\nVronsky, who stood near her.",
      "I must rest a little before my journey.",
      "Are you certainly going tomorrow then?",
      "asked Vronsky.",
      "Yes, I suppose so,  answered Anna, as it were wondering at the\nboldness of his question; but the irrepressible, quivering brilliance\nof her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna did not stay to supper, but went home.",
      "Chapter 24\n\n Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,  thought Levin, as\nhe came away from the Shtcherbatskys , and walked in the direction of\nhis brother s lodgings.",
      "And I don t get on with other people.",
      "Pride,\nthey say.",
      "No, I have no pride.",
      "If I had any pride, I should not have\nput myself in such a position.",
      "And he pictured to himself Vronsky,\nhappy, good-natured, clever, and self-possessed, certainly never placed\nin the awful position in which he had been that evening.",
      "Yes, she was\nbound to choose him.",
      "So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone\nor anything.",
      "I am myself to blame.",
      "What right had I to imagine she\nwould care to join her life to mine?",
      "Who am I and what am I?",
      "A nobody,\nnot wanted by anyone, nor of use to anybody.",
      "And he recalled his\nbrother Nikolay, and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him.",
      "Isn t\nhe right that everything in the world is base and loathsome?",
      "And are we\nfair in our judgment of brother Nikolay?",
      "Of course, from the point of\nview of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he s a\ndespicable person.",
      "But I know him differently.",
      "I know his soul, and\nknow that we are like him.",
      "And I, instead of going to seek him out,\nwent out to dinner, and came here.",
      "Levin walked up to a lamppost, read\nhis brother s address, which was in his pocketbook, and called a\nsledge.",
      "All the long way to his brother s, Levin vividly recalled all\nthe facts familiar to him of his brother Nikolay s life.",
      "He remembered\nhow his brother, while at the university, and for a year afterwards,\nhad, in spite of the jeers of his companions, lived like a monk,\nstrictly observing all religious rites, services, and fasts, and\navoiding every sort of pleasure, especially women.",
      "And afterwards, how\nhe had all at once broken out: he had associated with the most horrible\npeople, and rushed into the most senseless debauchery.",
      "He remembered\nlater the scandal over a boy, whom he had taken from the country to\nbring up, and, in a fit of rage, had so violently beaten that\nproceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding.",
      "Then he\nrecalled the scandal with a sharper, to whom he had lost money, and\ngiven a promissory note, and against whom he had himself lodged a\ncomplaint, asserting that he had cheated him.",
      "(This was the money\nSergey Ivanovitch had paid.)",
      "Then he remembered how he had spent a\nnight in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street.",
      "He remembered\nthe shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother\nSergey Ivanovitch, accusing him of not having paid him his share of his\nmother s fortune, and the last scandal, when he had gone to a western\nprovince in an official capacity, and there had got into trouble for\nassaulting a village elder....",
      "It was all horribly disgusting, yet to\nLevin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it\ninevitably would to those who did not know Nikolay, did not know all\nhis story, did not know his heart.",
      "Levin remembered that when Nikolay had been in the devout stage, the\nperiod of fasts and monks and church services, when he was seeking in\nreligion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament, everyone,\nfar from encouraging him, had jeered at him, and he, too, with the\nothers.",
      "They had teased him, called him Noah, and monk; and, when he\nhad broken out, no one had helped him, but everyone had turned away\nfrom him with horror and disgust.",
      "Levin felt that, in spite of all the ugliness of his life, his brother\nNikolay, in his soul, in the very depths of his soul, was no more in\nthe wrong than the people who despised him.",
      "He was not to blame for\nhaving been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited\nintelligence.",
      "But he had always wanted to be good.",
      "I will tell him\neverything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve,\ntoo, and I ll show him that I love him, and so understand him,  Levin\nresolved to himself, as, towards eleven o clock, he reached the hotel\nof which he had the address.",
      "At the top, 12 and 13,  the porter answered Levin s inquiry.",
      "At home?",
      "Sure to be at home.",
      "The door of No.",
      "12 was half open, and there came out into the streak of\nlight thick fumes of cheap, poor tobacco, and the sound of a voice,\nunknown to Levin; but he knew at once that his brother was there; he\nheard his cough.",
      "As he went in the door, the unknown voice was saying:\n\n It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing s done.",
      "Konstantin Levin looked in at the door, and saw that the speaker was a\nyoung man with an immense shock of hair, wearing a Russian jerkin, and\nthat a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown, without collar or cuffs, was\nsitting on the sofa.",
      "His brother was not to be seen.",
      "Konstantin felt a\nsharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which\nhis brother spent his life.",
      "No one had heard him, and Konstantin,\ntaking off his galoshes, listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin\nwas saying.",
      "He was speaking of some enterprise.",
      "Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,  his brother s\nvoice responded, with a cough.",
      "Masha!",
      "get us some supper and some wine\nif there s any left; or else go and get some.",
      "The woman rose, came out from behind the screen, and saw Konstantin.",
      "There s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,  she said.",
      "Whom do you want?",
      "said the voice of Nikolay Levin, angrily.",
      "It s I,  answered Konstantin Levin, coming forward into the light.",
      "Who s _I_?",
      "Nikolay s voice said again, still more angrily.",
      "He could\nbe heard getting up hurriedly, stumbling against something, and Levin\nsaw, facing him in the doorway, the big, scared eyes, and the huge,\nthin, stooping figure of his brother, so familiar, and yet astonishing\nin its weirdness and sickliness.",
      "He was even thinner than three years before, when Konstantin Levin had\nseen him last.",
      "He was wearing a short coat, and his hands and big bones\nseemed huger than ever.",
      "His hair had grown thinner, the same straight\nmustaches hid his lips, the same eyes gazed strangely and na vely at\nhis visitor.",
      "Ah, Kostya!",
      "he exclaimed suddenly, recognizing his brother, and his\neyes lit up with joy.",
      "But the same second he looked round at the young\nman, and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that Konstantin\nknew so well, as if his neckband hurt him; and a quite different\nexpression, wild, suffering, and cruel, rested on his emaciated face.",
      "I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don t know you and\ndon t want to know you.",
      "What is it you want?",
      "He was not at all the same as Konstantin had been fancying him.",
      "The\nworst and most tiresome part of his character, what made all relations\nwith him so difficult, had been forgotten by Konstantin Levin when he\nthought of him, and now, when he saw his face, and especially that\nnervous twitching of his head, he remembered it all.",
      "I didn t want to see you for anything,  he answered timidly.",
      "I ve\nsimply come to see you.",
      "His brother s timidity obviously softened Nikolay.",
      "His lips twitched.",
      "Oh, so that s it?",
      "he said.",
      "Well, come in; sit down.",
      "Like some\nsupper?",
      "Masha, bring supper for three.",
      "No, stop a minute.",
      "Do you know\nwho this is?",
      "he said, addressing his brother, and indicating the\ngentleman in the jerkin:  This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a\nvery remarkable man.",
      "He s persecuted by the police, of course, because\nhe s not a scoundrel.",
      "And he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room.",
      "Seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go, he\nshouted to her,  Wait a minute, I said.",
      "And with the inability to\nexpress himself, the incoherence that Konstantin knew so well, he\nbegan, with another look round at everyone, to tell his brother\nKritsky s story: how he had been expelled from the university for\nstarting a benefit society for the poor students and Sunday schools;\nand how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school, and how\nhe had been driven out of that too, and had afterwards been condemned\nfor something.",
      "You re of the Kiev university?",
      "said Konstantin Levin to Kritsky, to\nbreak the awkward silence that followed.",
      "Yes, I was of Kiev,  Kritsky replied angrily, his face darkening.",
      "And this woman,  Nikolay Levin interrupted him, pointing to her,  is\nthe partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "I took her out of a bad\nhouse,  and he jerked his neck saying this;  but I love her and respect\nher, and anyone who wants to know me,  he added, raising his voice and\nknitting his brows,  I beg to love her and respect her.",
      "She s just the\nsame as my wife, just the same.",
      "So now you know whom you ve to do with.",
      "And if you think you re lowering yourself, well, here s the floor,\nthere s the door.",
      "And again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them.",
      "Why I should be lowering myself, I don t understand.",
      "Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and\nwine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn t matter.... Go along.",
      "Chapter 25\n\n So you see,  pursued Nikolay Levin, painfully wrinkling his forehead\nand twitching.",
      "It was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do.",
      "Here, do you see?",
      "...",
      "He pointed to some sort of iron bars, fastened\ntogether with strings, lying in a corner of the room.",
      "Do you see that?",
      "That s the beginning of a new thing we re going into.",
      "It s a productive\nassociation.... \n\nKonstantin scarcely heard him.",
      "He looked into his sickly, consumptive\nface, and he was more and more sorry for him, and he could not force\nhimself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the\nassociation.",
      "He saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him\nfrom self-contempt.",
      "Nikolay Levin went on talking:\n\n You know that capital oppresses the laborer.",
      "The laborers with us, the\npeasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however\nmuch they work they can t escape from their position of beasts of\nburden.",
      "All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their\nposition, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education,\nall the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists.",
      "And\nsociety s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the\nprofit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of\nburden to the end.",
      "And that state of things must be changed,  he\nfinished up, and he looked questioningly at his brother.",
      "Yes, of course,  said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had\ncome out on his brother s projecting cheekbones.",
      "And so we re founding a locksmiths  association, where all the\nproduction and profit and the chief instruments of production will be\nin common.",
      "Where is the association to be?",
      "asked Konstantin Levin.",
      "In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.",
      "But why in a village?",
      "In the villages, I think, there is plenty of\nwork as it is.",
      "Why a locksmiths  association in a village?",
      "Why?",
      "Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were,\nand that s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don t like people to try and\nget them out of their slavery,  said Nikolay Levin, exasperated by the\nobjection.",
      "Konstantin Levin sighed, looking meanwhile about the cheerless and\ndirty room.",
      "This sigh seemed to exasperate Nikolay still more.",
      "I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch s aristocratic views.",
      "I know that he\napplies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.",
      "No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?",
      "said Levin,\nsmiling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch?",
      "I ll tell you what for!",
      "Nikolay Levin shrieked\nsuddenly at the name of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I ll tell you what for....",
      "But what s the use of talking?",
      "There s only one thing.... What did you\ncome to me for?",
      "You look down on this, and you re welcome to, and go\naway, in God s name go away!",
      "he shrieked, getting up from his chair.",
      "And go away, and go away!",
      "I don t look down on it at all,  said Konstantin Levin timidly.",
      "I\ndon t even dispute it.",
      "At that instant Marya Nikolaevna came back.",
      "Nikolay Levin looked round\nangrily at her.",
      "She went quickly to him, and whispered something.",
      "I m not well; I ve grown irritable,  said Nikolay Levin, getting\ncalmer and breathing painfully;  and then you talk to me of Sergey\nIvanovitch and his article.",
      "It s such rubbish, such lying, such\nself-deception.",
      "What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of\nit?",
      "Have you read his article?",
      "he asked Kritsky, sitting down again at\nthe table, and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes, so\nas to clear a space.",
      "I ve not read it,  Kritsky responded gloomily, obviously not desiring\nto enter into the conversation.",
      "Why not?",
      "said Nikolay Levin, now turning with exasperation upon\nKritsky.",
      "Because I didn t see the use of wasting my time over it.",
      "Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?",
      "That article s too deep for many people that s to say it s over their\nheads.",
      "But with me, it s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I\nknow where its weakness lies.",
      "Everyone was mute.",
      "Kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap.",
      "Won t you have supper?",
      "All right, good-bye!",
      "Come round tomorrow with\nthe locksmith.",
      "Kritsky had hardly gone out when Nikolay Levin smiled and winked.",
      "He s no good either,  he said.",
      "I see, of course....",
      "But at that instant Kritsky, at the door, called him....\n\n What do you want now?",
      "he said, and went out to him in the passage.",
      "Left alone with Marya Nikolaevna, Levin turned to her.",
      "Have you been long with my brother?",
      "he said to her.",
      "Yes, more than a year.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch s health has become very\npoor.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,  she said.",
      "That is ... how does he drink?",
      "Drinks vodka, and it s bad for him.",
      "And a great deal?",
      "whispered Levin.",
      "Yes,  she said, looking timidly towards the doorway, where Nikolay\nLevin had reappeared.",
      "What were you talking about?",
      "he said, knitting his brows, and turning\nhis scared eyes from one to the other.",
      "What was it?",
      "Oh, nothing,  Konstantin answered in confusion.",
      "Oh, if you don t want to say, don t. Only it s no good your talking to\nher.",
      "She s a wench, and you re a gentleman,  he said with a jerk of the\nneck.",
      "You understand everything, I see, and have taken stock of\neverything, and look with commiseration on my shortcomings,  he began\nagain, raising his voice.",
      "Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,  whispered Marya\nNikolaevna, again going up to him.",
      "Oh, very well, very well!...",
      "But where s the supper?",
      "Ah, here it is, \nhe said, seeing a waiter with a tray.",
      "Here, set it here,  he added\nangrily, and promptly seizing the vodka, he poured out a glassful and\ndrank it greedily.",
      "Like a drink?",
      "he turned to his brother, and at\nonce became better humored.",
      "Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I m glad to see you, anyway.",
      "After\nall s said and done, we re not strangers.",
      "Come, have a drink.",
      "Tell me\nwhat you re doing,  he went on, greedily munching a piece of bread, and\npouring out another glassful.",
      "How are you living?",
      "I live alone in the country, as I used to.",
      "I m busy looking after the\nland,  answered Konstantin, watching with horror the greediness with\nwhich his brother ate and drank, and trying to conceal that he noticed\nit.",
      "Why don t you get married?",
      "It hasn t happened so,  Konstantin answered, reddening a little.",
      "Why not?",
      "For me now ... everything s at an end!",
      "I ve made a mess of my\nlife.",
      "But this I ve said, and I say still, that if my share had been\ngiven me when I needed it, my whole life would have been different.",
      "Konstantin made haste to change the conversation.",
      "Do you know your little Vanya s with me, a clerk in the countinghouse\nat Pokrovskoe.",
      "Nikolay jerked his neck, and sank into thought.",
      "Yes, tell me what s going on at Pokrovskoe.",
      "Is the house standing\nstill, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom?",
      "And Philip the\ngardener, is he living?",
      "How I remember the arbor and the seat!",
      "Now mind\nand don t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married,\nand make everything as it used to be again.",
      "Then I ll come and see you,\nif your wife is nice.",
      "But come to me now,  said Levin.",
      "How nicely we would arrange it!",
      "I d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "You wouldn t find him there.",
      "I live quite independently of him.",
      "Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and\nhim,  he said, looking timidly into his brother s face.",
      "This timidity touched Konstantin.",
      "If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you\nthat in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side.",
      "You re\nboth wrong.",
      "You re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.",
      "Ah, ah!",
      "You see that, you see that!",
      "Nikolay shouted joyfully.",
      "But I personally value friendly relations with you more because.... \n\n Why, why?",
      "Konstantin could not say that he valued it more because Nikolay was\nunhappy, and needed affection.",
      "But Nikolay knew that this was just what\nhe meant to say, and scowling he took up the vodka again.",
      "Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!",
      "said Marya Nikolaevna, stretching out\nher plump, bare arm towards the decanter.",
      "Let it be!",
      "Don t insist!",
      "I ll beat you!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna smiled a sweet and good-humored smile, which was at\nonce reflected on Nikolay s face, and she took the bottle.",
      "And do you suppose she understands nothing?",
      "said Nikolay.",
      "She\nunderstands it all better than any of us.",
      "Isn t it true there s\nsomething good and sweet in her?",
      "Were you never before in Moscow?",
      "Konstantin said to her, for the sake\nof saying something.",
      "Only you mustn t be polite and stiff with her.",
      "It frightens her.",
      "No\none ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her\nfor trying to get out of a house of ill-fame.",
      "Mercy on us, the\nsenselessness in the world!",
      "he cried suddenly.",
      "These new\ninstitutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what\nhideousness it all is!",
      "And he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions.",
      "Konstantin Levin heard him, and the disbelief in the sense of all\npublic institutions, which he shared with him, and often expressed, was\ndistasteful to him now from his brother s lips.",
      "In another world we shall understand it all,  he said lightly.",
      "In another world!",
      "Ah, I don t like that other world!",
      "I don t like it, \nhe said, letting his scared eyes rest on his brother s eyes.",
      "Here one\nwould think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one s own\nand other people s, would be a good thing, and yet I m afraid of death,\nawfully afraid of death.",
      "He shuddered.",
      "But do drink something.",
      "Would\nyou like some champagne?",
      "Or shall we go somewhere?",
      "Let s go to the\nGypsies!",
      "Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian\nsongs.",
      "His speech had begun to falter, and he passed abruptly from one subject\nto another.",
      "Konstantin with the help of Masha persuaded him not to go\nout anywhere, and got him to bed hopelessly drunk.",
      "Masha promised to write to Konstantin in case of need, and to persuade\nNikolay Levin to go and stay with his brother.",
      "Chapter 26\n\nIn the morning Konstantin Levin left Moscow, and towards evening he\nreached home.",
      "On the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors\nabout politics and the new railways, and, just as in Moscow, he was\novercome by a sense of confusion of ideas, dissatisfaction with\nhimself, shame of something or other.",
      "But when he got out at his own\nstation, when he saw his one-eyed coachman, Ignat, with the collar of\nhis coat turned up; when, in the dim light reflected by the station\nfires, he saw his own sledge, his own horses with their tails tied up,\nin their harness trimmed with rings and tassels; when the coachman\nIgnat, as he put in his luggage, told him the village news, that the\ncontractor had arrived, and that Pava had calved, he felt that little\nby little the confusion was clearing up, and the shame and\nself-dissatisfaction were passing away.",
      "He felt this at the mere sight\nof Ignat and the horses; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought\nfor him, had sat down wrapped up in the sledge, and had driven off\npondering on the work that lay before him in the village, and staring\nat the side-horse, that had been his saddle-horse, past his prime now,\nbut a spirited beast from the Don, he began to see what had happened to\nhim in quite a different light.",
      "He felt himself, and did not want to be\nanyone else.",
      "All he wanted now was to be better than before.",
      "In the\nfirst place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for\nany extraordinary happiness, such as marriage must have given him, and\nconsequently he would not so disdain what he really had.",
      "Secondly, he\nwould never again let himself give way to low passion, the memory of\nwhich had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make\nan offer.",
      "Then remembering his brother Nikolay, he resolved to himself\nthat he would never allow himself to forget him, that he would follow\nhim up, and not lose sight of him, so as to be ready to help when\nthings should go ill with him.",
      "And that would be soon, he felt.",
      "Then,\ntoo, his brother s talk of communism, which he had treated so lightly\nat the time, now made him think.",
      "He considered a revolution in economic\nconditions nonsense.",
      "But he always felt the injustice of his own\nabundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants, and now he\ndetermined that so as to feel quite in the right, though he had worked\nhard and lived by no means luxuriously before, he would now work still\nharder, and would allow himself even less luxury.",
      "And all this seemed\nto him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in\nthe pleasantest daydreams.",
      "With a resolute feeling of hope in a new,\nbetter life, he reached home before nine o clock at night.",
      "The snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a\nlight in the bedroom windows of his old nurse, Agafea Mihalovna, who\nperformed the duties of housekeeper in his house.",
      "She was not yet\nasleep.",
      "Kouzma, waked up by her, came sidling sleepily out onto the\nsteps.",
      "A setter bitch, Laska, ran out too, almost upsetting Kouzma, and\nwhining, turned round about Levin s knees, jumping up and longing, but\nnot daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.",
      "You re soon back again, sir,  said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "With friends, one is well; but at\nhome, one is better,  he answered, and went into his study.",
      "The study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in.",
      "The familiar\ndetails came out: the stag s horns, the bookshelves, the looking-glass,\nthe stove with its ventilator, which had long wanted mending, his\nfather s sofa, a large table, on the table an open book, a broken\nashtray, a manuscript book with his handwriting.",
      "As he saw all this,\nthere came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of\narranging the new life, of which he had been dreaming on the road.",
      "All\nthese traces of his life seemed to clutch him, and to say to him:  No,\nyou re not going to get away from us, and you re not going to be\ndifferent, but you re going to be the same as you ve always been; with\ndoubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to\namend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you\nwon t get, and which isn t possible for you.",
      "This the things said to him, but another voice in his heart was telling\nhim that he must not fall under the sway of the past, and that one can\ndo anything with oneself.",
      "And hearing that voice, he went into the\ncorner where stood his two heavy dumbbells, and began brandishing them\nlike a gymnast, trying to restore his confident temper.",
      "There was a\ncreak of steps at the door.",
      "He hastily put down the dumbbells.",
      "The bailiff came in, and said everything, thank God, was doing well;\nbut informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been\na little scorched.",
      "This piece of news irritated Levin.",
      "The new drying\nmachine had been constructed and partly invented by Levin.",
      "The bailiff\nhad always been against the drying machine, and now it was with\nsuppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been\nscorched.",
      "Levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been\nscorched, it was only because the precautions had not been taken, for\nwhich he had hundreds of times given orders.",
      "He was annoyed, and\nreprimanded the bailiff.",
      "But there had been an important and joyful\nevent: Pava, his best cow, an expensive beast, bought at a show, had\ncalved.",
      "Kouzma, give me my sheepskin.",
      "And you tell them to take a lantern.",
      "I ll come and look at her,  he said to the bailiff.",
      "The cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house.",
      "Walking across the yard, passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree, he went\ninto the cowhouse.",
      "There was the warm, steamy smell of dung when the\nfrozen door was opened, and the cows, astonished at the unfamiliar\nlight of the lantern, stirred on the fresh straw.",
      "He caught a glimpse\nof the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka.",
      "Berkoot, the\nbull, was lying down with his ring in his lip, and seemed about to get\nup, but thought better of it, and only gave two snorts as they passed\nby him.",
      "Pava, a perfect beauty, huge as a hippopotamus, with her back\nturned to them, prevented their seeing the calf, as she sniffed her all\nover.",
      "Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and\nspotted calf onto her long, tottering legs.",
      "Pava, uneasy, began lowing,\nbut when Levin put the calf close to her she was soothed, and, sighing\nheavily, began licking her with her rough tongue.",
      "The calf, fumbling,\npoked her nose under her mother s udder, and stiffened her tail out\nstraight.",
      "Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,  said Levin, examining the\ncalf.",
      "Like the mother!",
      "though the color takes after the father; but\nthat s nothing.",
      "Very good.",
      "Long and broad in the haunch.",
      "Vassily\nFedorovitch, isn t she splendid?",
      "he said to the bailiff, quite\nforgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in\nthe calf.",
      "How could she fail to be?",
      "Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after\nyou left.",
      "You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  said the\nbailiff.",
      "I did inform you about the machine.",
      "This question was enough to take Levin back to all the details of his\nwork on the estate, which was on a large scale, and complicated.",
      "He\nwent straight from the cowhouse to the counting house, and after a\nlittle conversation with the bailiff and Semyon the contractor, he went\nback to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing-room.",
      "Chapter 27\n\nThe house was big and old-fashioned, and Levin, though he lived alone,\nhad the whole house heated and used.",
      "He knew that this was stupid, he\nknew that it was positively not right, and contrary to his present new\nplans, but this house was a whole world to Levin.",
      "It was the world in\nwhich his father and mother had lived and died.",
      "They had lived just the\nlife that to Levin seemed the ideal of perfection, and that he had\ndreamed of beginning with his wife, his family.",
      "Levin scarcely remembered his mother.",
      "His conception of her was for him\na sacred memory, and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination\na repetition of that exquisite, holy ideal of a woman that his mother\nhad been.",
      "He was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage\nthat he positively pictured to himself first the family, and only\nsecondarily the woman who would give him a family.",
      "His ideas of\nmarriage were, consequently, quite unlike those of the great majority\nof his acquaintances, for whom getting married was one of the numerous\nfacts of social life.",
      "For Levin it was the chief affair of life, on\nwhich its whole happiness turned.",
      "And now he had to give up that.",
      "When he had gone into the little drawing-room, where he always had tea,\nand had settled himself in his armchair with a book, and Agafea\nMihalovna had brought him tea, and with her usual,  Well, I ll stay a\nwhile, sir,  had taken a chair in the window, he felt that, however\nstrange it might be, he had not parted from his daydreams, and that he\ncould not live without them.",
      "Whether with her, or with another, still\nit would be.",
      "He was reading a book, and thinking of what he was\nreading, and stopping to listen to Agafea Mihalovna, who gossiped away\nwithout flagging, and yet with all that, all sorts of pictures of\nfamily life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his\nimagination.",
      "He felt that in the depth of his soul something had been\nput in its place, settled down, and laid to rest.",
      "He heard Agafea Mihalovna talking of how Prohor had forgotten his duty\nto God, and with the money Levin had given him to buy a horse, had been\ndrinking without stopping, and had beaten his wife till he d half\nkilled her.",
      "He listened, and read his book, and recalled the whole\ntrain of ideas suggested by his reading.",
      "It was Tyndall s _Treatise on\nHeat_.",
      "He recalled his own criticisms of Tyndall of his complacent\nsatisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments, and for his lack of\nphilosophic insight.",
      "And suddenly there floated into his mind the\njoyful thought:  In two years  time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava\nherself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot\nand the three others how lovely!",
      "He took up his book again.",
      "Very good, electricity and heat are the\nsame thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the\nother in the equation for the solution of any problem?",
      "No.",
      "Well, then\nwhat of it?",
      "The connection between all the forces of nature is felt\ninstinctively....",
      "It s particulary nice if Pava s daughter should be a\nred-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other\nthree, too!",
      "Splendid!",
      "To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the\nherd.... My wife says,  Kostya and I looked after that calf like a\nchild.",
      "How can it interest you so much?",
      "says a visitor.",
      "Everything\nthat interests him, interests me.",
      "But who will she be?",
      "And he\nremembered what had happened at Moscow....  Well, there s nothing to be\ndone....",
      "It s not my fault.",
      "But now everything shall go on in a new\nway.",
      "It s nonsense to pretend that life won t let one, that the past\nwon t let one.",
      "One must struggle to live better, much better.",
      "...",
      "He\nraised his head, and fell to dreaming.",
      "Old Laska, who had not yet fully\ndigested her delight at his return, and had run out into the yard to\nbark, came back wagging her tail, and crept up to him, bringing in the\nscent of fresh air, put her head under his hand, and whined\nplaintively, asking to be stroked.",
      "There, who d have thought it?",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "The dog now ...\nwhy, she understands that her master s come home, and that he s\nlow-spirited.",
      "Why low-spirited?",
      "Do you suppose I don t see it, sir?",
      "It s high time I should know the\ngentry.",
      "Why, I ve grown up from a little thing with them.",
      "It s nothing,\nsir, so long as there s health and a clear conscience.",
      "Levin looked intently at her, surprised at how well she knew his\nthought.",
      "Shall I fetch you another cup?",
      "said she, and taking his cup she went\nout.",
      "Laska kept poking her head under his hand.",
      "He stroked her, and she\npromptly curled up at his feet, laying her head on a hindpaw.",
      "And in\ntoken of all now being well and satisfactory, she opened her mouth a\nlittle, smacked her lips, and settling her sticky lips more comfortably\nabout her old teeth, she sank into blissful repose.",
      "Levin watched all\nher movements attentively.",
      "That s what I ll do,  he said to himself;  that s what I ll do!",
      "Nothing s amiss.... All s well.",
      "Chapter 28\n\nAfter the ball, early next morning, Anna Arkadyevna sent her husband a\ntelegram that she was leaving Moscow the same day.",
      "No, I must go, I must go ; she explained to her sister-in-law the\nchange in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember\nso many things that there was no enumerating them:  no, it had really\nbetter be today!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was not dining at home, but he promised to come and\nsee his sister off at seven o clock.",
      "Kitty, too, did not come, sending a note that she had a headache.",
      "Dolly\nand Anna dined alone with the children and the English governess.",
      "Whether it was that the children were fickle, or that they had acute\nsenses, and felt that Anna was quite different that day from what she\nhad been when they had taken such a fancy to her, that she was not now\ninterested in them, but they had abruptly dropped their play with their\naunt, and their love for her, and were quite indifferent that she was\ngoing away.",
      "Anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her\ndeparture.",
      "She wrote notes to her Moscow acquaintances, put down her\naccounts, and packed.",
      "Altogether Dolly fancied she was not in a placid\nstate of mind, but in that worried mood, which Dolly knew well with\nherself, and which does not come without cause, and for the most part\ncovers dissatisfaction with self.",
      "After dinner, Anna went up to her\nroom to dress, and Dolly followed her.",
      "How queer you are today!",
      "Dolly said to her.",
      "I?",
      "Do you think so?",
      "I m not queer, but I m nasty.",
      "I am like that\nsometimes.",
      "I keep feeling as if I could cry.",
      "It s very stupid, but\nit ll pass off,  said Anna quickly, and she bent her flushed face over\na tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric\nhandkerchiefs.",
      "Her eyes were particularly bright, and were continually\nswimming with tears.",
      "In the same way I didn t want to leave\nPetersburg, and now I don t want to go away from here.",
      "You came here and did a good deed,  said Dolly, looking intently at\nher.",
      "Anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears.",
      "Don t say that, Dolly.",
      "I ve done nothing, and could do nothing.",
      "I\noften wonder why people are all in league to spoil me.",
      "What have I\ndone, and what could I do?",
      "In your heart there was found love enough to\nforgive....",
      "If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened!",
      "How\nhappy you are, Anna!",
      "said Dolly.",
      "Everything is clear and good in your\nheart.",
      "Every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the English say.",
      "You have no sort of _skeleton_, have you?",
      "Everything is so clear in\nyou.",
      "I have!",
      "said Anna suddenly, and, unexpectedly after her tears, a sly,\nironical smile curved her lips.",
      "Come, he s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing,  said\nDolly, smiling.",
      "No, he s depressing.",
      "Do you know why I m going today instead of\ntomorrow?",
      "It s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to\nyou,  said Anna, letting herself drop definitely into an armchair, and\nlooking straight into Dolly s face.",
      "And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up\nto the curly black ringlets on her neck.",
      "Yes,  Anna went on.",
      "Do you know why Kitty didn t come to dinner?",
      "She s jealous of me.",
      "I have spoiled ...",
      "I ve been the cause of that\nball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure.",
      "But truly, truly,\nit s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,  she said, daintily\ndrawling the words  a little bit.",
      "Oh, how like Stiva you said that!",
      "said Dolly, laughing.",
      "Anna was hurt.",
      "Oh no, oh no!",
      "I m not Stiva,  she said, knitting her brows.",
      "That s\nwhy I m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself\nfor an instant,  said Anna.",
      "But at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they\nwere not true.",
      "She was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at\nthe thought of Vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant,\nsimply to avoid meeting him.",
      "Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he.... \n\n You can t imagine how absurdly it all came about.",
      "I only meant to be\nmatchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently.",
      "Possibly\nagainst my own will.... \n\nShe crimsoned and stopped.",
      "Oh, they feel it directly?",
      "said Dolly.",
      "But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his\nside,  Anna interrupted her.",
      "And I am certain it will all be\nforgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.",
      "All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I m not very anxious for\nthis marriage for Kitty.",
      "And it s better it should come to nothing, if\nhe, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.",
      "Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!",
      "said Anna, and again a deep\nflush of pleasure came out on her face, when she heard the idea, that\nabsorbed her, put into words.",
      "And so here I am going away, having made\nan enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much!",
      "Ah, how sweet she is!",
      "But\nyou ll make it right, Dolly?",
      "Eh?",
      "Dolly could scarcely suppress a smile.",
      "She loved Anna, but she enjoyed\nseeing that she too had her weaknesses.",
      "An enemy?",
      "That can t be.",
      "I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care\nfor you more than ever,  said Anna, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Ah, how\nsilly I am today!",
      "She passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing.",
      "At the very moment of starting Stepan Arkadyevitch arrived, late, rosy\nand good-humored, smelling of wine and cigars.",
      "Anna s emotionalism infected Dolly, and when she embraced her\nsister-in-law for the last time, she whispered:  Remember, Anna, what\nyou ve done for me I shall never forget.",
      "And remember that I love you,\nand shall always love you as my dearest friend!",
      "I don t know why,  said Anna, kissing her and hiding her tears.",
      "You understood me, and you understand.",
      "Good-bye, my darling!",
      "Chapter 29\n\n Come, it s all over, and thank God!",
      "was the first thought that came\nto Anna Arkadyevna, when she had said good-bye for the last time to her\nbrother, who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till\nthe third bell rang.",
      "She sat down on her lounge beside Annushka, and\nlooked about her in the twilight of the sleeping-carriage.",
      "Thank God!",
      "tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life\nwill go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.",
      "Still in the same anxious frame of mind, as she had been all that day,\nAnna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great\ncare.",
      "With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red\nbag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping\nup her feet, settled herself comfortably.",
      "An invalid lady had already\nlain down to sleep.",
      "Two other ladies began talking to Anna, and a stout\nelderly lady tucked up her feet, and made observations about the\nheating of the train.",
      "Anna answered a few words, but not foreseeing any\nentertainment from the conversation, she asked Annushka to get a lamp,\nhooked it onto the arm of her seat, and took from her bag a paper-knife\nand an English novel.",
      "At first her reading made no progress.",
      "The fuss\nand bustle were disturbing; then when the train had started, she could\nnot help listening to the noises; then the snow beating on the left\nwindow and sticking to the pane, and the sight of the muffled guard\npassing by, covered with snow on one side, and the conversations about\nthe terrible snowstorm raging outside, distracted her attention.",
      "Farther on, it was continually the same again and again: the same\nshaking and rattling, the same snow on the window, the same rapid\ntransitions from steaming heat to cold, and back again to heat, the\nsame passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight, and the same\nvoices, and Anna began to read and to understand what she read.",
      "Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her\nbroad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna read and\nunderstood, but it was distasteful to her to read, that is, to follow\nthe reflection of other people s lives.",
      "She had too great a desire to\nlive herself.",
      "If she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a\nsick man, she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a\nsick man; if she read of a member of Parliament making a speech, she\nlonged to be delivering the speech; if she read of how Lady Mary had\nridden after the hounds, and had provoked her sister-in-law, and had\nsurprised everyone by her boldness, she too wished to be doing the\nsame.",
      "But there was no chance of doing anything; and twisting the\nsmooth paper-knife in her little hands, she forced herself to read.",
      "The hero of the novel was already almost reaching his English\nhappiness, a baronetcy and an estate, and Anna was feeling a desire to\ngo with him to the estate, when she suddenly felt that _he_ ought to\nfeel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing.",
      "But what had\nhe to be ashamed of?",
      "What have I to be ashamed of?",
      "she asked herself\nin injured surprise.",
      "She laid down the book and sank against the back\nof the chair, tightly gripping the paper-cutter in both hands.",
      "There\nwas nothing.",
      "She went over all her Moscow recollections.",
      "All were good,\npleasant.",
      "She remembered the ball, remembered Vronsky and his face of\nslavish adoration, remembered all her conduct with him: there was\nnothing shameful.",
      "And for all that, at the same point in her memories,\nthe feeling of shame was intensified, as though some inner voice, just\nat the point when she thought of Vronsky, were saying to her,  Warm,\nvery warm, hot.",
      "Well, what is it?",
      "she said to herself resolutely,\nshifting her seat in the lounge.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "Am I afraid to\nlook it straight in the face?",
      "Why, what is it?",
      "Can it be that between\nme and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations\nthan such as are common with every acquaintance?",
      "She laughed\ncontemptuously and took up her book again; but now she was definitely\nunable to follow what she read.",
      "She passed the paper-knife over the\nwindow pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek, and\nalmost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without\ncause came over her.",
      "She felt as though her nerves were strings being\nstrained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg.",
      "She felt her\neyes opening wider and wider, her fingers and toes twitching nervously,\nsomething within oppressing her breathing, while all shapes and sounds\nseemed in the uncertain half-light to strike her with unaccustomed\nvividness.",
      "Moments of doubt were continually coming upon her, when she\nwas uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards, or\nwere standing still altogether; whether it were Annushka at her side or\na stranger.",
      "What s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some\nbeast?",
      "And what am I myself?",
      "Myself or some other woman?",
      "She was\nafraid of giving way to this delirium.",
      "But something drew her towards\nit, and she could yield to it or resist it at will.",
      "She got up to rouse\nherself, and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress.",
      "For\na moment she regained her self-possession, and realized that the thin\npeasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat, with buttons missing\nfrom it, was the stoveheater, that he was looking at the thermometer,\nthat it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door; but\nthen everything grew blurred again.... That peasant with the long waist\nseemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began\nstretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it\nwith a black cloud; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging, as\nthough someone were being torn to pieces; then there was a blinding\ndazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and\nhide everything.",
      "Anna felt as though she were sinking down.",
      "But it was\nnot terrible, but delightful.",
      "The voice of a man muffled up and covered\nwith snow shouted something in her ear.",
      "She got up and pulled herself\ntogether; she realized that they had reached a station and that this\nwas the guard.",
      "She asked Annushka to hand her the cape she had taken\noff and her shawl, put them on and moved towards the door.",
      "Do you wish to get out?",
      "asked Annushka.",
      "Yes, I want a little air.",
      "It s very hot in here.",
      "And she opened the\ndoor.",
      "The driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled\nwith her over the door.",
      "But she enjoyed the struggle.",
      "She opened the door and went out.",
      "The wind seemed as though lying in\nwait for her; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear\nher off, but she clung to the cold door post, and holding her skirt got\ndown onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages.",
      "The wind\nhad been powerful on the steps, but on the platform, under the lee of\nthe carriages, there was a lull.",
      "With enjoyment she drew deep breaths\nof the frozen, snowy air, and standing near the carriage looked about\nthe platform and the lighted station.",
      "Chapter 30\n\nThe raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the\ncarriages, about the scaffolding, and round the corner of the station.",
      "The carriages, posts, people, everything that was to be seen was\ncovered with snow on one side, and was getting more and more thickly\ncovered.",
      "For a moment there would come a lull in the storm, but then it\nwould swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible\nto stand against it.",
      "Meanwhile men ran to and fro, talking merrily\ntogether, their steps crackling on the platform as they continually\nopened and closed the big doors.",
      "The bent shadow of a man glided by at\nher feet, and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron.",
      "Hand over that\ntelegram!",
      "came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other\nside.",
      "This way!",
      "No.",
      "28!",
      "several different voices shouted again, and\nmuffled figures ran by covered with snow.",
      "Two gentlemen with lighted\ncigarettes passed by her.",
      "She drew one more deep breath of the fresh\nair, and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door\npost and get back into the carriage, when another man in a military\novercoat, quite close beside her, stepped between her and the\nflickering light of the lamp post.",
      "She looked round, and the same\ninstant recognized Vronsky s face.",
      "Putting his hand to the peak of his\ncap, he bowed to her and asked, Was there anything she wanted?",
      "Could he\nbe of any service to her?",
      "She gazed rather a long while at him without\nanswering, and, in spite of the shadow in which he was standing, she\nsaw, or fancied she saw, both the expression of his face and his eyes.",
      "It was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked\nupon her the day before.",
      "More than once she had told herself during the\npast few days, and again only a few moments before, that Vronsky was\nfor her only one of the hundreds of young men, forever exactly the\nsame, that are met everywhere, that she would never allow herself to\nbestow a thought upon him.",
      "But now at the first instant of meeting him,\nshe was seized by a feeling of joyful pride.",
      "She had no need to ask why\nhe had come.",
      "She knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was\nhere to be where she was.",
      "I didn t know you were going.",
      "What are you coming for?",
      "she said,\nletting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post.",
      "And\nirrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face.",
      "What am I coming for?",
      "he repeated, looking straight into her eyes.",
      "You know that I have come to be where you are,  he said;  I can t help\nit.",
      "At that moment the wind, as it were, surmounting all obstacles, sent\nthe snow flying from the carriage roofs, and clanked some sheet of iron\nit had torn off, while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in\nfront, plaintively and gloomily.",
      "All the awfulness of the storm seemed\nto her more splendid now.",
      "He had said what her soul longed to hear,\nthough she feared it with her reason.",
      "She made no answer, and in her\nface he saw conflict.",
      "Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,  he said humbly.",
      "He had spoken courteously, deferentially, yet so firmly, so stubbornly,\nthat for a long while she could make no answer.",
      "It s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you re a good man, to\nforget what you ve said, as I forget it,  she said at last.",
      "Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever\nforget....",
      "Enough, enough!",
      "she cried trying assiduously to give a stern\nexpression to her face, into which he was gazing greedily.",
      "And\nclutching at the cold door post, she clambered up the steps and got\nrapidly into the corridor of the carriage.",
      "But in the little corridor\nshe paused, going over in her imagination what had happened.",
      "Though she\ncould not recall her own words or his, she realized instinctively that\nthe momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer; and she\nwas panic-stricken and blissful at it.",
      "After standing still a few\nseconds, she went into the carriage and sat down in her place.",
      "The\noverstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come\nback, but was intensified, and reached such a pitch that she was afraid\nevery minute that something would snap within her from the excessive\ntension.",
      "She did not sleep all night.",
      "But in that nervous tension, and\nin the visions that filled her imagination, there was nothing\ndisagreeable or gloomy: on the contrary there was something blissful,\nglowing, and exhilarating.",
      "Towards morning Anna sank into a doze,\nsitting in her place, and when she waked it was daylight and the train\nwas near Petersburg.",
      "At once thoughts of home, of husband and of son,\nand the details of that day and the following came upon her.",
      "At Petersburg, as soon as the train stopped and she got out, the first\nperson that attracted her attention was her husband.",
      "Oh, mercy!",
      "why do\nhis ears look like that?",
      "she thought, looking at his frigid and\nimposing figure, and especially the ears that struck her at the moment\nas propping up the brim of his round hat.",
      "Catching sight of her, he\ncame to meet her, his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile,\nand his big, tired eyes looking straight at her.",
      "An unpleasant\nsensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary\nglance, as though she had expected to see him different.",
      "She was\nespecially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that\nshe experienced on meeting him.",
      "That feeling was an intimate, familiar\nfeeling, like a consciousness of hypocrisy, which she experienced in\nher relations with her husband.",
      "But hitherto she had not taken note of\nthe feeling, now she was clearly and painfully aware of it.",
      "Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year\nafter marriage, burned with impatience to see you,  he said in his\ndeliberate, high-pitched voice, and in that tone which he almost always\ntook with her, a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest\nwhat he said.",
      "Is Seryozha quite well?",
      "she asked.",
      "And is this all the reward,  said he,  for my ardor?",
      "He s quite\nwell.... \n\n\nChapter 31\n\nVronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night.",
      "He sat in his\narmchair, looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in\nand out.",
      "If he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed\npeople who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure, he\nseemed now more haughty and self-possessed than ever.",
      "He looked at\npeople as if they were things.",
      "A nervous young man, a clerk in a law\ncourt, sitting opposite him, hated him for that look.",
      "The young man\nasked him for a light, and entered into conversation with him, and even\npushed against him, to make him feel that he was not a thing, but a\nperson.",
      "But Vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp, and the\nyoung man made a wry face, feeling that he was losing his\nself-possession under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him\nas a person.",
      "Vronsky saw nothing and no one.",
      "He felt himself a king, not because he\nbelieved that he had made an impression on Anna he did not yet believe\nthat, but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness\nand pride.",
      "What would come of it all he did not know, he did not even think.",
      "He\nfelt that all his forces, hitherto dissipated, wasted, were centered on\none thing, and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal.",
      "And he\nwas happy at it.",
      "He knew only that he had told her the truth, that he\nhad come where she was, that all the happiness of his life, the only\nmeaning in life for him, now lay in seeing and hearing her.",
      "And when he\ngot out of the carriage at Bologova to get some seltzer water, and\ncaught sight of Anna, involuntarily his first word had told her just\nwhat he thought.",
      "And he was glad he had told her it, that she knew it\nnow and was thinking of it.",
      "He did not sleep all night.",
      "When he was\nback in the carriage, he kept unceasingly going over every position in\nwhich he had seen her, every word she had uttered, and before his\nfancy, making his heart faint with emotion, floated pictures of a\npossible future.",
      "When he got out of the train at Petersburg, he felt after his sleepless\nnight as keen and fresh as after a cold bath.",
      "He paused near his\ncompartment, waiting for her to get out.",
      "Once more,  he said to\nhimself, smiling unconsciously,  once more I shall see her walk, her\nface; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.",
      "But\nbefore he caught sight of her, he saw her husband, whom the\nstation-master was deferentially escorting through the crowd.",
      "Ah, yes!",
      "The husband.",
      "Only now for the first time did Vronsky realize clearly\nthe fact that there was a person attached to her, a husband.",
      "He knew\nthat she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and\nonly now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his\nlegs clad in black trousers; especially when he saw this husband calmly\ntake her arm with a sense of property.",
      "Seeing Alexey Alexandrovitch with his Petersburg face and severely\nself-confident figure, in his round hat, with his rather prominent\nspine, he believed in him, and was aware of a disagreeable sensation,\nsuch as a man might feel tortured by thirst, who, on reaching a spring,\nshould find a dog, a sheep, or a pig, who has drunk of it and muddied\nthe water.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s manner of walking, with a swing of\nthe hips and flat feet, particularly annoyed Vronsky.",
      "He could\nrecognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her.",
      "But\nshe was still the same, and the sight of her affected him the same way,\nphysically reviving him, stirring him, and filling his soul with\nrapture.",
      "He told his German valet, who ran up to him from the second\nclass, to take his things and go on, and he himself went up to her.",
      "He\nsaw the first meeting between the husband and wife, and noted with a\nlover s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her\nhusband.",
      "No, she does not love him and cannot love him,  he decided to\nhimself.",
      "At the moment when he was approaching Anna Arkadyevna he noticed too\nwith joy that she was conscious of his being near, and looked round,\nand seeing him, turned again to her husband.",
      "Have you passed a good night?",
      "he asked, bowing to her and her husband\ntogether, and leaving it up to Alexey Alexandrovitch to accept the bow\non his own account, and to recognize it or not, as he might see fit.",
      "Thank you, very good,  she answered.",
      "Her face looked weary, and there was not that play of eagerness in it,\npeeping out in her smile and her eyes; but for a single instant, as she\nglanced at him, there was a flash of something in her eyes, and\nalthough the flash died away at once, he was happy for that moment.",
      "She\nglanced at her husband to find out whether he knew Vronsky.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch looked at Vronsky with displeasure, vaguely recalling\nwho this was.",
      "Vronsky s composure and self-confidence here struck, like\na scythe against a stone, upon the cold self-confidence of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Count Vronsky,  said Anna.",
      "Ah!",
      "We are acquainted, I believe,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch\nindifferently, giving his hand.",
      "You set off with the mother and you return with the son,  he said,\narticulating each syllable, as though each were a separate favor he was\nbestowing.",
      "You re back from leave, I suppose?",
      "he said, and without waiting for a\nreply, he turned to his wife in his jesting tone:  Well, were a great\nmany tears shed at Moscow at parting?",
      "By addressing his wife like this he gave Vronsky to understand that he\nwished to be left alone, and, turning slightly towards him, he touched\nhis hat; but Vronsky turned to Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,  he said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at Vronsky.",
      "Delighted,  he said coldly.",
      "On Mondays we re at home.",
      "Most\nfortunate,  he said to his wife, dismissing Vronsky altogether,  that I\nshould just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my\ndevotion,  he went on in the same jesting tone.",
      "You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,  she\nresponded in the same jesting tone, involuntarily listening to the\nsound of Vronsky s steps behind them.",
      "But what has it to do with me?",
      "she said to herself, and she began asking her husband how Seryozha had\ngot on without her.",
      "Oh, capitally!",
      "Mariette says he has been very good, And ...",
      "I must\ndisappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has.",
      "But\nonce more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day.",
      "Our dear _Samovar_\nwill be delighted.",
      "(He used to call the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, well\nknown in society, a samovar, because she was always bubbling over with\nexcitement.)",
      "She has been continually asking after you.",
      "And, do you\nknow, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.",
      "You know how she takes everything to heart.",
      "Just now, with all her own\ncares, she s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together.",
      "The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a friend of her husband s, and the\ncenter of that one of the coteries of the Petersburg world with which\nAnna was, through her husband, in the closest relations.",
      "But you know I wrote to her?",
      "Still she ll want to hear details.",
      "Go and see her, if you re not too\ntired, my dear.",
      "Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I\ngo to my committee.",
      "I shall not be alone at dinner again,  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch went on, no longer in a sarcastic tone.",
      "You wouldn t\nbelieve how I ve missed....  And with a long pressure of her hand and a\nmeaning smile, he put her in her carriage.",
      "Chapter 32\n\nThe first person to meet Anna at home was her son.",
      "He dashed down the\nstairs to her, in spite of the governess s call, and with desperate joy\nshrieked:  Mother!",
      "mother!",
      "Running up to her, he hung on her neck.",
      "I told you it was mother!",
      "he shouted to the governess.",
      "I knew!",
      "And her son, like her husband, aroused in Anna a feeling akin to\ndisappointment.",
      "She had imagined him better than he was in reality.",
      "She\nhad to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really\nwas.",
      "But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue\neyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up\nstockings.",
      "Anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation\nof his nearness, and his caresses, and moral soothing, when she met his\nsimple, confiding, and loving glance, and heard his na ve questions.",
      "Anna took out the presents Dolly s children had sent him, and told her\nson what sort of little girl was Tanya at Moscow, and how Tanya could\nread, and even taught the other children.",
      "Why, am I not so nice as she?",
      "asked Seryozha.",
      "To me you re nicer than anyone in the world.",
      "I know that,  said Seryozha, smiling.",
      "Anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the Countess Lidia\nIvanovna was announced.",
      "The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout\nwoman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black\neyes.",
      "Anna liked her, but today she seemed to be seeing her for the\nfirst time with all her defects.",
      "Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?",
      "inquired Countess Lidia\nIvanovna, as soon as she came into the room.",
      "Yes, it s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had\nsupposed,  answered Anna.",
      "My _belle-s ur_ is in general too hasty.",
      "But Countess Lidia Ivanovna, though she was interested in everything\nthat did not concern her, had a habit of never listening to what\ninterested her; she interrupted Anna:\n\n Yes, there s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world.",
      "I am so worried\ntoday.",
      "Oh, why?",
      "asked Anna, trying to suppress a smile.",
      "I m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and\nsometimes I m quite unhinged by it.",
      "The Society of the Little Sisters \n(this was a religiously-patriotic, philanthropic institution)  was\ngoing splendidly, but with these gentlemen it s impossible to do\nanything,  added Countess Lidia Ivanovna in a tone of ironical\nsubmission to destiny.",
      "They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and\nthen work it out so pettily and unworthily.",
      "Two or three people, your\nhusband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the\nothers simply drag it down.",
      "Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me.... \n\nPravdin was a well-known Panslavist abroad, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna\ndescribed the purport of his letter.",
      "Then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against\nthe work of the unification of the churches, and departed in haste, as\nshe had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the\nSlavonic committee.",
      "It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn t notice\nit before?",
      "Anna asked herself.",
      "Or has she been very much irritated\ntoday?",
      "It s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a\nChristian, yet she s always angry; and she always has enemies, and\nalways enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.",
      "After Countess Lidia Ivanovna another friend came, the wife of a chief\nsecretary, who told her all the news of the town.",
      "At three o clock she\ntoo went away, promising to come to dinner.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was\nat the ministry.",
      "Anna, left alone, spent the time till dinner in\nassisting at her son s dinner (he dined apart from his parents) and in\nputting her things in order, and in reading and answering the notes and\nletters which had accumulated on her table.",
      "The feeling of causeless shame, which she had felt on the journey, and\nher excitement, too, had completely vanished.",
      "In the habitual\nconditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable.",
      "She recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day.",
      "What\nwas it?",
      "Nothing.",
      "Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put\na stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done.",
      "To speak of it to my\nhusband would be unnecessary and out of the question.",
      "To speak of it\nwould be to attach importance to what has no importance.",
      "She\nremembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a\ndeclaration made her at Petersburg by a young man, one of her husband s\nsubordinates, and how Alexey Alexandrovitch had answered that every\nwoman living in the world was exposed to such incidents, but that he\nhad the fullest confidence in her tact, and could never lower her and\nhimself by jealousy.",
      "So then there s no reason to speak of it?",
      "And\nindeed, thank God, there s nothing to speak of,  she told herself.",
      "Chapter 33\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at\nfour o clock, but as often happened, he had not time to come in to her.",
      "He went into his study to see the people waiting for him with\npetitions, and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary.",
      "At dinner time (there were always a few people dining with the\nKarenins) there arrived an old lady, a cousin of Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nthe chief secretary of the department and his wife, and a young man who\nhad been recommended to Alexey Alexandrovitch for the service.",
      "Anna\nwent into the drawing-room to receive these guests.",
      "Precisely at five\no clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth\nstroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening\ncoat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner.",
      "Every\nminute of Alexey Alexandrovitch s life was portioned out and occupied.",
      "And to make time to get through all that lay before him every day, he\nadhered to the strictest punctuality.",
      "Unhasting and unresting,  was\nhis motto.",
      "He came into the dining hall, greeted everyone, and\nhurriedly sat down, smiling to his wife.",
      "Yes, my solitude is over.",
      "You wouldn t believe how uncomfortable  (he\nlaid stress on the word _uncomfortable_)  it is to dine alone.",
      "At dinner he talked a little to his wife about Moscow matters, and,\nwith a sarcastic smile, asked her after Stepan Arkadyevitch; but the\nconversation was for the most part general, dealing with Petersburg\nofficial and public news.",
      "After dinner he spent half an hour with his\nguests, and again, with a smile, pressed his wife s hand, withdrew, and\ndrove off to the council.",
      "Anna did not go out that evening either to\nthe Princess Betsy Tverskaya, who, hearing of her return, had invited\nher, nor to the theater, where she had a box for that evening.",
      "She did\nnot go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not\nready.",
      "Altogether, Anna, on turning, after the departure of her guests,\nto the consideration of her attire, was very much annoyed.",
      "She was\ngenerally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense,\nand before leaving Moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to\ntransform.",
      "The dresses had to be altered so that they could not be\nrecognized, and they ought to have been ready three days before.",
      "It\nappeared that two dresses had not been done at all, while the other one\nhad not been altered as Anna had intended.",
      "The dressmaker came to\nexplain, declaring that it would be better as she had done it, and Anna\nwas so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards.",
      "To regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery, and spent\nthe whole evening with her son, put him to bed herself, signed him with\nthe cross, and tucked him up.",
      "She was glad she had not gone out\nanywhere, and had spent the evening so well.",
      "She felt so light-hearted\nand serene, she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so\nimportant on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial\nincidents of fashionable life, and that she had no reason to feel\nashamed before anyone else or before herself.",
      "Anna sat down at the\nhearth with an English novel and waited for her husband.",
      "Exactly at\nhalf-past nine she heard his ring, and he came into the room.",
      "Here you are at last!",
      "she observed, holding out her hand to him.",
      "He kissed her hand and sat down beside her.",
      "Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,  he said to her.",
      "Oh, yes,  she said, and she began telling him about everything from\nthe beginning: her journey with Countess Vronskaya, her arrival, the\naccident at the station.",
      "Then she described the pity she had felt,\nfirst for her brother, and afterwards for Dolly.",
      "I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is\nyour brother,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch severely.",
      "Anna smiled.",
      "She knew that he said that simply to show that family\nconsiderations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine\nopinion.",
      "She knew that characteristic in her husband, and liked it.",
      "I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back\nagain,  he went on.",
      "Come, what do they say about the new act I have\ngot passed in the council?",
      "Anna had heard nothing of this act, and she felt conscience-stricken at\nhaving been able so readily to forget what was to him of such\nimportance.",
      "Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,  he said, with\na complacent smile.",
      "She saw that Alexey Alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something\npleasant to him about it, and she brought him by questions to telling\nit.",
      "With the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had\nreceived in consequence of the act he had passed.",
      "I was very, very glad.",
      "It shows that at last a reasonable and steady\nview of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.",
      "Having drunk his second cup of tea with cream, and bread, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch got up, and was going towards his study.",
      "And you ve not been anywhere this evening?",
      "You ve been dull, I\nexpect?",
      "he said.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "she answered, getting up after him and accompanying him\nacross the room to his study.",
      "What are you reading now?",
      "she asked.",
      "Just now I m reading Duc de Lille, _Po sie des Enfers,_  he answered.",
      "A very remarkable book.",
      "Anna smiled, as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love, and,\nputting her hand under his, she escorted him to the door of the study.",
      "She knew his habit, that had grown into a necessity, of reading in the\nevening.",
      "She knew, too, that in spite of his official duties, which\nswallowed up almost the whole of his time, he considered it his duty to\nkeep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual\nworld.",
      "She knew, too, that he was really interested in books dealing\nwith politics, philosophy, and theology, that art was utterly foreign\nto his nature; but, in spite of this, or rather, in consequence of it,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art,\nbut made it his duty to read everything.",
      "She knew that in politics, in\nphilosophy, in theology, Alexey Alexandrovitch often had doubts, and\nmade investigations; but on questions of art and poetry, and, above\nall, of music, of which he was totally devoid of understanding, he had\nthe most distinct and decided opinions.",
      "He was fond of talking about\nShakespeare, Raphael, Beethoven, of the significance of new schools of\npoetry and music, all of which were classified by him with very\nconspicuous consistency.",
      "Well, God be with you,  she said at the door of the study, where a\nshaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.",
      "And I ll write to Moscow.",
      "He pressed her hand, and again kissed it.",
      "All the same he s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable\nin his own line,  Anna said to herself going back to her room, as\nthough she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said\nthat one could not love him.",
      "But why is it his ears stick out so\nstrangely?",
      "Or has he had his hair cut?",
      "Precisely at twelve o clock, when Anna was still sitting at her\nwriting-table, finishing a letter to Dolly, she heard the sound of\nmeasured steps in slippers, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, freshly washed\nand combed, with a book under his arm, came in to her.",
      "It s time, it s time,  said he, with a meaning smile, and he went into\ntheir bedroom.",
      "And what right had he to look at him like that?",
      "thought Anna,\nrecalling Vronsky s glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Undressing, she went into the bedroom; but her face had none of the\neagerness which, during her stay in Moscow, had fairly flashed from her\neyes and her smile; on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in\nher, hidden somewhere far away.",
      "Chapter 34\n\nWhen Vronsky went to Moscow from Petersburg, he had left his large set\nof rooms in Morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade Petritsky.",
      "Petritsky was a young lieutenant, not particularly well-connected, and\nnot merely not wealthy, but always hopelessly in debt.",
      "Towards evening\nhe was always drunk, and he had often been locked up after all sorts of\nludicrous and disgraceful scandals, but he was a favorite both of his\ncomrades and his superior officers.",
      "On arriving at twelve o clock from\nthe station at his flat, Vronsky saw, at the outer door, a hired\ncarriage familiar to him.",
      "While still outside his own door, as he rang,\nhe heard masculine laughter, the lisp of a feminine voice, and\nPetritsky s voice.",
      "If that s one of the villains, don t let him in!",
      "Vronsky told the servant not to announce him, and slipped quietly into\nthe first room.",
      "Baroness Shilton, a friend of Petritsky s, with a rosy\nlittle face and flaxen hair, resplendent in a lilac satin gown, and\nfilling the whole room, like a canary, with her Parisian chatter, sat\nat the round table making coffee.",
      "Petritsky, in his overcoat, and the\ncavalry captain Kamerovsky, in full uniform, probably just come from\nduty, were sitting each side of her.",
      "Bravo!",
      "Vronsky!",
      "shouted Petritsky, jumping up, scraping his chair.",
      "Our host himself!",
      "Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee\npot.",
      "Why, we didn t expect you!",
      "Hope you re satisfied with the ornament\nof your study,  he said, indicating the baroness.",
      "You know each other,\nof course?",
      "I should think so,  said Vronsky, with a bright smile, pressing the\nbaroness s little hand.",
      "What next!",
      "I m an old friend.",
      "You re home after a journey,  said the baroness,  so I m flying.",
      "Oh,\nI ll be off this minute, if I m in the way.",
      "You re home, wherever you are, baroness,  said Vronsky.",
      "How do you\ndo, Kamerovsky?",
      "he added, coldly shaking hands with Kamerovsky.",
      "There, you never know how to say such pretty things,  said the\nbaroness, turning to Petritsky.",
      "No; what s that for?",
      "After dinner I say things quite as good.",
      "After dinner there s no credit in them?",
      "Well, then, I ll make you some\ncoffee, so go and wash and get ready,  said the baroness, sitting down\nagain, and anxiously turning the screw in the new coffee pot.",
      "Pierre,\ngive me the coffee,  she said, addressing Petritsky, whom she called\nPierre as a contraction of his surname, making no secret of her\nrelations with him.",
      "I ll put it in.",
      "You ll spoil it!",
      "No, I won t spoil it!",
      "Well, and your wife?",
      "said the baroness\nsuddenly, interrupting Vronsky s conversation with his comrade.",
      "We ve\nbeen marrying you here.",
      "Have you brought your wife?",
      "No, baroness.",
      "I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.",
      "So much the better, so much the better.",
      "Shake hands on it.",
      "And the baroness, detaining Vronsky, began telling him, with many\njokes, about her last new plans of life, asking his advice.",
      "He persists in refusing to give me a divorce!",
      "Well, what am I to do?",
      "(_He_ was her husband.)",
      "Now I want to begin a suit against him.",
      "What\ndo you advise?",
      "Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it s boiling over.",
      "You see, I m engrossed with business!",
      "I want a lawsuit, because I must\nhave my property.",
      "Do you understand the folly of it, that on the\npretext of my being unfaithful to him,  she said contemptuously,  he\nwants to get the benefit of my fortune.",
      "Vronsky heard with pleasure this light-hearted prattle of a pretty\nwoman, agreed with her, gave her half-joking counsel, and altogether\ndropped at once into the tone habitual to him in talking to such women.",
      "In his Petersburg world all people were divided into utterly opposed\nclasses.",
      "One, the lower class, vulgar, stupid, and, above all,\nridiculous people, who believe that one husband ought to live with the\none wife whom he has lawfully married; that a girl should be innocent,\na woman modest, and a man manly, self-controlled, and strong; that one\nought to bring up one s children, earn one s bread, and pay one s\ndebts; and various similar absurdities.",
      "This was the class of\nold-fashioned and ridiculous people.",
      "But there was another class of\npeople, the real people.",
      "To this class they all belonged, and in it the\ngreat thing was to be elegant, generous, plucky, gay, to abandon\noneself without a blush to every passion, and to laugh at everything\nelse.",
      "For the first moment only, Vronsky was startled after the impression of\na quite different world that he had brought with him from Moscow.",
      "But\nimmediately as though slipping his feet into old slippers, he dropped\nback into the light-hearted, pleasant world he had always lived in.",
      "The coffee was never really made, but spluttered over everyone, and\nboiled away, doing just what was required of it that is, providing much\ncause for much noise and laughter, and spoiling a costly rug and the\nbaroness s gown.",
      "Well now, good-bye, or you ll never get washed, and I shall have on my\nconscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit.",
      "So you would advise a\nknife to his throat?",
      "To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.",
      "He ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,  answered\nVronsky.",
      "So at the Fran ais!",
      "and, with a rustle of her skirts, she vanished.",
      "Kamerovsky got up too, and Vronsky, not waiting for him to go, shook\nhands and went off to his dressing-room.",
      "While he was washing, Petritsky described to him in brief outlines his\nposition, as far as it had changed since Vronsky had left Petersburg.",
      "No money at all.",
      "His father said he wouldn t give him any and pay his\ndebts.",
      "His tailor was trying to get him locked up, and another fellow,\ntoo, was threatening to get him locked up.",
      "The colonel of the regiment\nhad announced that if these scandals did not cease he would have to\nleave.",
      "As for the baroness, he was sick to death of her, especially\nsince she d taken to offering continually to lend him money.",
      "But he had\nfound a girl he d show her to Vronsky a marvel, exquisite, in the\nstrict Oriental style,  genre of the slave Rebecca, don t you know.",
      "He d had a row, too, with Berkoshov, and was going to send seconds to\nhim, but of course it would come to nothing.",
      "Altogether everything was\nsupremely amusing and jolly.",
      "And, not letting his comrade enter into\nfurther details of his position, Petritsky proceeded to tell him all\nthe interesting news.",
      "As he listened to Petritsky s familiar stories in\nthe familiar setting of the rooms he had spent the last three years in,\nVronsky felt a delightful sense of coming back to the careless\nPetersburg life that he was used to.",
      "Impossible!",
      "he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in\nwhich he had been sousing his healthy red neck.",
      "Impossible!",
      "he cried,\nat the news that Laura had flung over Fertinghof and had made up to\nMileev.",
      "And is he as stupid and pleased as ever?",
      "Well, and how s\nBuzulukov?",
      "Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov simply lovely!",
      "cried Petritsky.",
      "You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court\nball.",
      "He went to a big ball in a new helmet.",
      "Have you seen the new\nhelmets?",
      "Very nice, lighter.",
      "Well, so he s standing.... No, I say, do\nlisten.",
      "I am listening,  answered Vronsky, rubbing himself with a rough towel.",
      "Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as\nill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new\nhelmets.",
      "The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to\nthe ambassador.",
      "They see our friend standing there.",
      "(Petritsky\nmimicked how he was standing with the helmet.)",
      "The Grand Duchess asked\nhim to give her the helmet; he doesn t give it to her.",
      "What do you\nthink of that?",
      "Well, everyone s winking at him, nodding, frowning give\nit to her, do!",
      "He doesn t give it to her.",
      "He s mute as a fish.",
      "Only\npicture it!...",
      "Well, the ... what s his name, whatever he was ... tries\nto take the helmet from him ... he won t give it up!...",
      "He pulls it\nfrom him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess.",
      "Here, your Highness, \nsays he,  is the new helmet.",
      "She turned the helmet the other side up,\nAnd just picture it!",
      "plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two\npounds of sweetmeats!...",
      "He d been storing them up, the darling!",
      "Vronsky burst into roars of laughter.",
      "And long afterwards, when he was\ntalking of other things, he broke out into his healthy laugh, showing\nhis strong, close rows of teeth, when he thought of the helmet.",
      "Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the assistance of his valet,\ngot into his uniform, and went off to report himself.",
      "He intended, when\nhe had done that, to drive to his brother s and to Betsy s and to pay\nseveral visits with a view to beginning to go into that society where\nhe might meet Madame Karenina.",
      "As he always did in Petersburg, he left\nhome not meaning to return till late at night.",
      "PART TWO\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nAt the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys  house, a consultation\nwas being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty s health\nand the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength.",
      "She had\nbeen ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.",
      "The family doctor gave\nher cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first\nand the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his\nadvice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was\ncalled in.",
      "The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still\nyoungish, asked to examine the patient.",
      "He maintained, with peculiar\nsatisfaction, it seemed, that maiden modesty is a mere relic of\nbarbarism, and that nothing could be more natural than for a man still\nyoungish to handle a young girl naked.",
      "He thought it natural because he\ndid it every day, and felt and thought, as it seemed to him, no harm as\nhe did it and consequently he considered modesty in the girl not merely\nas a relic of barbarism, but also as an insult to himself.",
      "There was nothing for it but to submit, since, although all the doctors\nhad studied in the same school, had read the same books, and learned\nthe same science, and though some people said this celebrated doctor\nwas a bad doctor, in the princess s household and circle it was for\nsome reason accepted that this celebrated doctor alone had some special\nknowledge, and that he alone could save Kitty.",
      "After a careful\nexamination and sounding of the bewildered patient, dazed with shame,\nthe celebrated doctor, having scrupulously washed his hands, was\nstanding in the drawing-room talking to the prince.",
      "The prince frowned\nand coughed, listening to the doctor.",
      "As a man who had seen something\nof life, and neither a fool nor an invalid, he had no faith in\nmedicine, and in his heart was furious at the whole farce, specially as\nhe was perhaps the only one who fully comprehended the cause of Kitty s\nillness.",
      "Conceited blockhead!",
      "he thought, as he listened to the\ncelebrated doctor s chatter about his daughter s symptoms.",
      "The doctor\nwas meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt\nfor this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level\nof his intelligence.",
      "He perceived that it was no good talking to the\nold man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.",
      "Before her he decided to scatter his pearls.",
      "At that instant the\nprincess came into the drawing-room with the family doctor.",
      "The prince\nwithdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole\nperformance.",
      "The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.",
      "She felt she had sinned against Kitty.",
      "Well, doctor, decide our fate,  said the princess.",
      "Tell me\neverything.",
      "Is there hope?",
      "she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could\nnot utter the question.",
      "Well, doctor?",
      "Immediately, princess.",
      "I will talk it over with my colleague, and then\nI will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.",
      "So we had better leave you?",
      "As you please.",
      "The princess went out with a sigh.",
      "When the doctors were left alone, the family doctor began timidly\nexplaining his opinion, that there was a commencement of tuberculous\ntrouble, but ... and so on.",
      "The celebrated doctor listened to him, and\nin the middle of his sentence looked at his big gold watch.",
      "Yes,  said he.",
      "But....",
      "The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his\nobservations.",
      "The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are\naware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing\ndefinite.",
      "But we may suspect it.",
      "And there are indications;\nmalnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.",
      "The question stands\nthus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be\ndone to maintain nutrition?",
      "But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in\nthese cases,  the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a\nsubtle smile.",
      "Yes, that s an understood thing,  responded the celebrated physician,\nagain glancing at his watch.",
      "Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done\nyet, or shall I have to drive around?",
      "he asked.",
      "Ah!",
      "it is.",
      "Oh, well,\nthen I can do it in twenty minutes.",
      "So we were saying the problem may\nbe put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.",
      "The\none is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides\nat once.",
      "And how about a tour abroad?",
      "asked the family doctor.",
      "I ve no liking for foreign tours.",
      "And take note: if there is an early\nstage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign\ntour will be of no use.",
      "What is wanted is means of improving nutrition,\nand not for lowering it.",
      "And the celebrated doctor expounded his plan\nof treatment with Soden waters, a remedy obviously prescribed primarily\non the ground that they could do no harm.",
      "The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.",
      "But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the\nremoval from conditions calling up reminiscences.",
      "And then the mother\nwishes it,  he added.",
      "Ah!",
      "Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go.",
      "Only, those German\nquacks are mischievous....",
      "They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let\nthem go then.",
      "He glanced once more at his watch.",
      "Oh!",
      "time s up already,  And he went to the door.",
      "The celebrated doctor\nannounced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated\nhis doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.",
      "What!",
      "another examination!",
      "cried the mother, with horror.",
      "Oh, no, only a few details, princess.",
      "Come this way.",
      "And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing-room\nto Kitty.",
      "Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left\nthere by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in\nthe middle of the room.",
      "When the doctor came in she flushed crimson,\nand her eyes filled with tears.",
      "All her illness and treatment struck\nher as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!",
      "Doctoring her seemed to her\nas absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.",
      "Her heart\nwas broken.",
      "Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders?",
      "But\nshe could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered\nherself to blame.",
      "May I trouble you to sit down, princess?",
      "the celebrated doctor said\nto her.",
      "He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began\nasking her tiresome questions.",
      "She answered him, and all at once got\nup, furious.",
      "Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.",
      "This is the\nthird time you ve asked me the same thing.",
      "The celebrated doctor did not take offense.",
      "Nervous irritability,  he said to the princess, when Kitty had left\nthe room.",
      "However, I had finished.... \n\nAnd the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an\nexceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess,\nand concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were\ncertainly harmless.",
      "At the question: Should they go abroad?",
      "the doctor\nplunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem.",
      "Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put\nno faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.",
      "It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after\nthe doctor had gone.",
      "The mother was much more cheerful when she went\nback to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.",
      "She had\noften, almost always, to be pretending now.",
      "Really, I m quite well, mamma.",
      "But if you want to go abroad, let s\ngo!",
      "she said, and trying to appear interested in the proposed tour,\nshe began talking of the preparations for the journey.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nSoon after the doctor, Dolly had arrived.",
      "She knew that there was to be\na consultation that day, and though she was only just up after her\nconfinement (she had another baby, a little girl, born at the end of\nthe winter), though she had trouble and anxiety enough of her own, she\nhad left her tiny baby and a sick child, to come and hear Kitty s fate,\nwhich was to be decided that day.",
      "Well, well?",
      "she said, coming into the drawing-room, without taking\noff her hat.",
      "You re all in good spirits.",
      "Good news, then?",
      "They tried to tell her what the doctor had said, but it appeared that\nthough the doctor had talked distinctly enough and at great length, it\nwas utterly impossible to report what he had said.",
      "The only point of\ninterest was that it was settled they should go abroad.",
      "Dolly could not help sighing.",
      "Her dearest friend, her sister, was going\naway.",
      "And her life was not a cheerful one.",
      "Her relations with Stepan\nArkadyevitch after their reconciliation had become humiliating.",
      "The\nunion Anna had cemented turned out to be of no solid character, and\nfamily harmony was breaking down again at the same point.",
      "There had\nbeen nothing definite, but Stepan Arkadyevitch was hardly ever at home;\nmoney, too, was hardly ever forthcoming, and Dolly was continually\ntortured by suspicions of infidelity, which she tried to dismiss,\ndreading the agonies of jealousy she had been through already.",
      "The\nfirst onslaught of jealousy, once lived through, could never come back\nagain, and even the discovery of infidelities could never now affect\nher as it had the first time.",
      "Such a discovery now would only mean\nbreaking up family habits, and she let herself be deceived, despising\nhim and still more herself, for the weakness.",
      "Besides this, the care of\nher large family was a constant worry to her: first, the nursing of her\nyoung baby did not go well, then the nurse had gone away, now one of\nthe children had fallen ill.\n\n Well, how are all of you?",
      "asked her mother.",
      "Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own.",
      "Lili is ill, and I m\nafraid it s scarlatina.",
      "I have come here now to hear about Kitty, and\nthen I shall shut myself up entirely, if God forbid it should be\nscarlatina.",
      "The old prince too had come in from his study after the doctor s\ndeparture, and after presenting his cheek to Dolly, and saying a few\nwords to her, he turned to his wife:\n\n How have you settled it?",
      "you re going?",
      "Well, and what do you mean to\ndo with me?",
      "I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,  said his wife.",
      "That s as you like.",
      "Mamma, why shouldn t father come with us?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "It would be\nnicer for him and for us too.",
      "The old prince got up and stroked Kitty s hair.",
      "She lifted her head and\nlooked at him with a forced smile.",
      "It always seemed to her that he\nunderstood her better than anyone in the family, though he did not say\nmuch about her.",
      "Being the youngest, she was her father s favorite, and\nshe fancied that his love gave him insight.",
      "When now her glance met his\nblue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw\nright through her, and understood all that was not good that was\npassing within her.",
      "Reddening, she stretched out towards him expecting\na kiss, but he only patted her hair and said:\n\n These stupid chignons!",
      "There s no getting at the real daughter.",
      "One\nsimply strokes the bristles of dead women.",
      "Well, Dolinka,  he turned to\nhis elder daughter,  what s your young buck about, hey?",
      "Nothing, father,  answered Dolly, understanding that her husband was\nmeant.",
      "He s always out; I scarcely ever see him,  she could not resist\nadding with a sarcastic smile.",
      "Why, hasn t he gone into the country yet to see about selling that\nforest?",
      "No, he s still getting ready for the journey.",
      "Oh, that s it!",
      "said the prince.",
      "And so am I to be getting ready for\na journey too?",
      "At your service,  he said to his wife, sitting down.",
      "And I tell you what, Katia,  he went on to his younger daughter,  you\nmust wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I m quite well, and\nmerry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the\nfrost.",
      "Hey?",
      "What her father said seemed simple enough, yet at these words Kitty\nbecame confused and overcome like a detected criminal.",
      "Yes, he sees it\nall, he understands it all, and in these words he s telling me that\nthough I m ashamed, I must get over my shame.",
      "She could not pluck up\nspirit to make any answer.",
      "She tried to begin, and all at once burst\ninto tears, and rushed out of the room.",
      "See what comes of your jokes!",
      "the princess pounced down on her\nhusband.",
      "You re always....  she began a string of reproaches.",
      "The prince listened to the princess s scolding rather a long while\nwithout speaking, but his face was more and more frowning.",
      "She s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you\ndon t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the\ncause of it.",
      "Ah!",
      "to be so mistaken in people!",
      "said the princess, and\nby the change in her tone both Dolly and the prince knew she was\nspeaking of Vronsky.",
      "I don t know why there aren t laws against such\nbase, dishonorable people.",
      "Ah, I can t bear to hear you!",
      "said the prince gloomily, getting up\nfrom his low chair, and seeming anxious to get away, yet stopping in\nthe doorway.",
      "There are laws, madam, and since you ve challenged me to\nit, I ll tell you who s to blame for it all: you and you, you and\nnobody else.",
      "Laws against such young gallants there have always been,\nand there still are!",
      "Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to\nhave been, old as I am, I d have called him out to the barrier, the\nyoung dandy.",
      "Yes, and now you physic her and call in these quacks.",
      "The prince apparently had plenty more to say, but as soon as the\nprincess heard his tone she subsided at once, and became penitent, as\nshe always did on serious occasions.",
      "Alexander, Alexander,  she whispered, moving to him and beginning to\nweep.",
      "As soon as she began to cry the prince too calmed down.",
      "He went up to\nher.",
      "There, that s enough, that s enough!",
      "You re wretched too, I know.",
      "It\ncan t be helped.",
      "There s no great harm done.",
      "God is merciful ...\nthanks....  he said, not knowing what he was saying, as he responded to\nthe tearful kiss of the princess that he felt on his hand.",
      "And the\nprince went out of the room.",
      "Before this, as soon as Kitty went out of the room in tears, Dolly,\nwith her motherly, family instincts, had promptly perceived that here a\nwoman s work lay before her, and she prepared to do it.",
      "She took off\nher hat, and, morally speaking, tucked up her sleeves and prepared for\naction.",
      "While her mother was attacking her father, she tried to\nrestrain her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow.",
      "During the\nprince s outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and\ntender towards her father for so quickly being kind again.",
      "But when her\nfather left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needful to\ngo to Kitty and console her.",
      "I d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did\nyou know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the\nlast time?",
      "He told Stiva so.",
      "Well, what then?",
      "I don t understand....",
      "So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?...",
      "She didn t tell you so?",
      "No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she s too\nproud.",
      "But I know it s all on account of the other.",
      "Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn t have refused\nhim if it hadn t been for the other, I know.",
      "And then, he has deceived\nher so horribly.",
      "It was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned\nagainst her daughter, and she broke out angrily.",
      "Oh, I really don t understand!",
      "Nowadays they will all go their own\nway, and mothers haven t a word to say in anything, and then.... \n\n Mamma, I ll go up to her.",
      "Well, do.",
      "Did I tell you not to?",
      "said her mother.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nWhen she went into Kitty s little room, a pretty, pink little room,\nfull of knick-knacks in _vieux saxe,_ as fresh, and pink, and white,\nand gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how\nthey had decorated the room the year before together, with what love\nand gaiety.",
      "Her heart turned cold when she saw Kitty sitting on a low\nchair near the door, her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug.",
      "Kitty glanced at her sister, and the cold, rather ill-tempered\nexpression of her face did not change.",
      "I m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won t be able\nto come to see me,  said Dolly, sitting down beside her.",
      "I want to\ntalk to you.",
      "What about?",
      "Kitty asked swiftly, lifting her head in dismay.",
      "What should it be, but your trouble?",
      "I have no trouble.",
      "Nonsense, Kitty.",
      "Do you suppose I could help knowing?",
      "I know all about\nit.",
      "And believe me, it s of so little consequence.... We ve all been\nthrough it.",
      "Kitty did not speak, and her face had a stern expression.",
      "He s not worth your grieving over him,  pursued Darya Alexandrovna,\ncoming straight to the point.",
      "No, because he has treated me with contempt,  said Kitty, in a\nbreaking voice.",
      "Don t talk of it!",
      "Please, don t talk of it!",
      "But who can have told you so?",
      "No one has said that.",
      "I m certain he was\nin love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it\nhadn t.... \n\n Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!",
      "shrieked\nKitty, suddenly flying into a passion.",
      "She turned round on her chair,\nflushed crimson, and rapidly moving her fingers, pinched the clasp of\nher belt first with one hand and then with the other.",
      "Dolly knew this\ntrick her sister had of clenching her hands when she was much excited;\nshe knew, too, that in moments of excitement Kitty was capable of\nforgetting herself and saying a great deal too much, and Dolly would\nhave soothed her, but it was too late.",
      "What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?",
      "said Kitty quickly.",
      "That I ve been in love with a man who didn t care a straw for me, and\nthat I m dying of love for him?",
      "And this is said to me by my own\nsister, who imagines that ... that ... that she s sympathizing with\nme!...",
      "I don t want these condolences and humbug!",
      "Kitty, you re unjust.",
      "Why are you tormenting me?",
      "But I ... quite the contrary ...",
      "I see you re unhappy....",
      "But Kitty in her fury did not hear her.",
      "I ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about.",
      "I am too proud\never to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.",
      "Yes, I don t say so either.... Only one thing.",
      "Tell me the truth, \nsaid Darya Alexandrovna, taking her by the hand:  tell me, did Levin\nspeak to you?...",
      "The mention of Levin s name seemed to deprive Kitty of the last vestige\nof self-control.",
      "She leaped up from her chair, and flinging her clasp\non the ground, she gesticulated rapidly with her hands and said:\n\n Why bring Levin in too?",
      "I can t understand what you want to torment me\nfor.",
      "I ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and\nnever, _never_ would I do as you re doing go back to a man who s\ndeceived you, who has cared for another woman.",
      "I can t understand it!",
      "You may, but I can t!",
      "And saying these words she glanced at her sister, and seeing that Dolly\nsat silent, her head mournfully bowed, Kitty, instead of running out of\nthe room as she had meant to do, sat down near the door, and hid her\nface in her handkerchief.",
      "The silence lasted for two minutes: Dolly was thinking of herself.",
      "That\nhumiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with a\npeculiar bitterness when her sister reminded her of it.",
      "She had not\nlooked for such cruelty in her sister, and she was angry with her.",
      "But\nsuddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt, and with it the sound of\nheart-rending, smothered sobbing, and felt arms about her neck.",
      "Kitty\nwas on her knees before her.",
      "Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!",
      "she whispered penitently.",
      "And the\nsweet face covered with tears hid itself in Darya Alexandrovna s skirt.",
      "As though tears were the indispensable oil, without which the machinery\nof mutual confidence could not run smoothly between the two sisters,\nthe sisters after their tears talked, not of what was uppermost in\ntheir minds, but, though they talked of outside matters, they\nunderstood each other.",
      "Kitty knew that the words she had uttered in\nanger about her husband s infidelity and her humiliating position had\ncut her poor sister to the heart, but that she had forgiven her.",
      "Dolly\nfor her part knew all she had wanted to find out.",
      "She felt certain that\nher surmises were correct; that Kitty s misery, her inconsolable\nmisery, was due precisely to the fact that Levin had made her an offer\nand she had refused him, and Vronsky had deceived her, and that she was\nfully prepared to love Levin and to detest Vronsky.",
      "Kitty said not a\nword of that; she talked of nothing but her spiritual condition.",
      "I have nothing to make me miserable,  she said, getting calmer;  but\ncan you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome,\ncoarse to me, and I myself most of all?",
      "You can t imagine what\nloathsome thoughts I have about everything.",
      "Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?",
      "asked Dolly, smiling.",
      "The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can t tell you.",
      "It s not\nunhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse.",
      "As though everything that\nwas good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most\nloathsome.",
      "Come, how am I to tell you?",
      "she went on, seeing the puzzled\nlook in her sister s eyes.",
      "Father began saying something to me just\nnow....",
      "It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married.",
      "Mother\ntakes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married\noff as soon as may be, and be rid of me.",
      "I know it s not the truth, but\nI can t drive away such thoughts.",
      "Eligible suitors, as they call them I\ncan t bear to see them.",
      "It seems to me they re taking stock of me and\nsumming me up.",
      "In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple\njoy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward.",
      "And then!",
      "The doctor.... Then....  Kitty hesitated; she wanted to say further\nthat ever since this change had taken place in her, Stepan Arkadyevitch\nhad become insufferably repulsive to her, and that she could not see\nhim without the grossest and most hideous conceptions rising before her\nimagination.",
      "Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most\nloathsome light,  she went on.",
      "That s my illness.",
      "Perhaps it will pass\noff.",
      "But you mustn t think about it.",
      "I can t help it.",
      "I m never happy except with the children at your\nhouse.",
      "What a pity you can t be with me!",
      "Oh, yes, I m coming.",
      "I ve had scarlatina, and I ll persuade mamma to\nlet me.",
      "Kitty insisted on having her way, and went to stay at her sister s and\nnursed the children all through the scarlatina, for scarlatina it\nturned out to be.",
      "The two sisters brought all the six children\nsuccessfully through it, but Kitty was no better in health, and in Lent\nthe Shtcherbatskys went abroad.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nThe highest Petersburg society is essentially one: in it everyone knows\neveryone else, everyone even visits everyone else.",
      "But this great set\nhas its subdivisions.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close\nties in three different circles of this highest society.",
      "One circle was\nher husband s government official set, consisting of his colleagues and\nsubordinates, brought together in the most various and capricious\nmanner, and belonging to different social strata.",
      "Anna found it\ndifficult now to recall the feeling of almost awe-stricken reverence\nwhich she had at first entertained for these persons.",
      "Now she knew all\nof them as people know one another in a country town; she knew their\nhabits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them.",
      "She\nknew their relations with one another and with the head authorities,\nknew who was for whom, and how each one maintained his position, and\nwhere they agreed and disagreed.",
      "But the circle of political, masculine\ninterests had never interested her, in spite of countess Lidia\nIvanovna s influence, and she avoided it.",
      "Another little set with which Anna was in close relations was the one\nby means of which Alexey Alexandrovitch had made his career.",
      "The center\nof this circle was the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "It was a set made up of\nelderly, ugly, benevolent, and godly women, and clever, learned, and\nambitious men.",
      "One of the clever people belonging to the set had called\nit  the conscience of Petersburg society.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had\nthe highest esteem for this circle, and Anna with her special gift for\ngetting on with everyone, had in the early days of her life in\nPetersburg made friends in this circle also.",
      "Now, since her return from\nMoscow, she had come to feel this set insufferable.",
      "It seemed to her\nthat both she and all of them were insincere, and she felt so bored and\nill at ease in that world that she went to see the Countess Lidia\nIvanovna as little as possible.",
      "The third circle with which Anna had ties was preeminently the\nfashionable world the world of balls, of dinners, of sumptuous dresses,\nthe world that hung on to the court with one hand, so as to avoid\nsinking to the level of the demi-monde.",
      "For the demi-monde the members\nof that fashionable world believed that they despised, though their\ntastes were not merely similar, but in fact identical.",
      "Her connection\nwith this circle was kept up through Princess Betsy Tverskaya, her\ncousin s wife, who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand\nroubles, and who had taken a great fancy to Anna ever since she first\ncame out, showed her much attention, and drew her into her set, making\nfun of Countess Lidia Ivanovna s coterie.",
      "When I m old and ugly I ll be the same,  Betsy used to say;  but for a\npretty young woman like you it s early days for that house of charity.",
      "Anna had at first avoided as far as she could Princess Tverskaya s\nworld, because it necessitated an expenditure beyond her means, and\nbesides in her heart she preferred the first circle.",
      "But since her\nvisit to Moscow she had done quite the contrary.",
      "She avoided her\nserious-minded friends, and went out into the fashionable world.",
      "There\nshe met Vronsky, and experienced an agitating joy at those meetings.",
      "She met Vronsky specially often at Betsy s for Betsy was a Vronsky by\nbirth and his cousin.",
      "Vronsky was everywhere where he had any chance of\nmeeting Anna, and speaking to her, when he could, of his love.",
      "She gave\nhim no encouragement, but every time she met him there surged up in her\nheart that same feeling of quickened life that had come upon her that\nday in the railway carriage when she saw him for the first time.",
      "She\nwas conscious herself that her delight sparkled in her eyes and curved\nher lips into a smile, and she could not quench the expression of this\ndelight.",
      "At first Anna sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for\ndaring to pursue her.",
      "Soon after her return from Moscow, on arriving at\na _soir e_ where she had expected to meet him, and not finding him\nthere, she realized distinctly from the rush of disappointment that she\nhad been deceiving herself, and that this pursuit was not merely not\ndistasteful to her, but that it made the whole interest of her life.",
      "The celebrated singer was singing for the second time, and all the\nfashionable world was in the theater.",
      "Vronsky, seeing his cousin from\nhis stall in the front row, did not wait till the _entr acte_, but went\nto her box.",
      "Why didn t you come to dinner?",
      "she said to him.",
      "I marvel at the\nsecond sight of lovers,  she added with a smile, so that no one but he\ncould hear;  _she wasn t there_.",
      "But come after the opera.",
      "Vronsky looked inquiringly at her.",
      "She nodded.",
      "He thanked her by a\nsmile, and sat down beside her.",
      "But how I remember your jeers!",
      "continued Princess Betsy, who took a\npeculiar pleasure in following up this passion to a successful issue.",
      "What s become of all that?",
      "You re caught, my dear boy.",
      "That s my one desire, to be caught,  answered Vronsky, with his\nserene, good-humored smile.",
      "If I complain of anything it s only that\nI m not caught enough, to tell the truth.",
      "I begin to lose hope.",
      "Why, whatever hope can you have?",
      "said Betsy, offended on behalf of\nher friend.",
      "_Entendons nous...._  But in her eyes there were gleams of\nlight that betrayed that she understood perfectly and precisely as he\ndid what hope he might have.",
      "None whatever,  said Vronsky, laughing and showing his even rows of\nteeth.",
      "Excuse me,  he added, taking an opera-glass out of her hand,\nand proceeding to scrutinize, over her bare shoulder, the row of boxes\nfacing them.",
      "I m afraid I m becoming ridiculous.",
      "He was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the\neyes of Betsy or any other fashionable people.",
      "He was very well aware\nthat in their eyes the position of an unsuccessful lover of a girl, or\nof any woman free to marry, might be ridiculous.",
      "But the position of a\nman pursuing a married woman, and, regardless of everything, staking\nhis life on drawing her into adultery, has something fine and grand\nabout it, and can never be ridiculous; and so it was with a proud and\ngay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the opera-glass and\nlooked at his cousin.",
      "But why was it you didn t come to dinner?",
      "she said, admiring him.",
      "I must tell you about that.",
      "I was busily employed, and doing what, do\nyou suppose?",
      "I ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you d\nnever guess.",
      "I ve been reconciling a husband with a man who d insulted\nhis wife.",
      "Yes, really!",
      "Well, did you succeed?",
      "Almost.",
      "You really must tell me about it,  she said, getting up.",
      "Come to me\nin the next _entr acte._ \n\n I can t; I m going to the French theater.",
      "From Nilsson?",
      "Betsy queried in horror, though she could not herself\nhave distinguished Nilsson s voice from any chorus girl s.\n\n Can t help it.",
      "I ve an appointment there, all to do with my mission of\npeace.",
      "Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven,  said\nBetsy, vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from\nsomeone.",
      "Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it s all about.",
      "And she sat down again.",
      "Chapter 5\n\n This is rather indiscreet, but it s so good it s an awful temptation\nto tell the story,  said Vronsky, looking at her with his laughing\neyes.",
      "I m not going to mention any names.",
      "But I shall guess, so much the better.",
      "Well, listen: two festive young men were driving \n\n Officers of your regiment, of course?",
      "I didn t say they were officers, two young men who had been lunching.",
      "In other words, drinking.",
      "Possibly.",
      "They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in\nthe most festive state of mind.",
      "And they beheld a pretty woman in a\nhired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they\nfancy anyway, nods to them and laughs.",
      "They, of course, follow her.",
      "They gallop at full speed.",
      "To their amazement, the fair one alights at\nthe entrance of the very house to which they were going.",
      "The fair one\ndarts upstairs to the top story.",
      "They get a glimpse of red lips under a\nshort veil, and exquisite little feet.",
      "You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the\ntwo.",
      "And after what you said, just now!",
      "Well, the young men go in to their\ncomrade s; he was giving a farewell dinner.",
      "There they certainly did\ndrink a little too much, as one always does at farewell dinners.",
      "And at\ndinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house.",
      "No one knows;\nonly their host s valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any  young\nladies  are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great\nmany of them about there.",
      "After dinner the two young men go into their\nhost s study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one.",
      "They compose\nan ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter\nupstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not\nperfectly intelligible in the letter.",
      "Why are you telling me these horrible stories?",
      "Well?",
      "They ring.",
      "A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the letter,\nand assure the maid that they re both so in love that they ll die on\nthe spot at the door.",
      "The maid, stupefied, carries in their messages.",
      "All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as\na lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his\nwife, and sends them both about their business.",
      "How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?",
      "Ah, you shall hear.",
      "I ve just been to make peace between them.",
      "Well, and what then?",
      "That s the most interesting part of the story.",
      "It appears that it s a\nhappy couple, a government clerk and his lady.",
      "The government clerk\nlodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!...",
      "I\nassure you Talleyrand couldn t hold a candle to me.",
      "Why, where was the difficulty?",
      "Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we\nentreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding.",
      "The\ngovernment clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too, desires\nto express his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express\nthem, he begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again I m obliged\nto trot out all my diplomatic talents.",
      "I allowed that their conduct was\nbad, but I urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness,\ntheir youth; then, too, the young men had only just been lunching\ntogether.",
      "You understand.",
      "They regret it deeply, and beg you to\noverlook their misbehavior.",
      "The government clerk was softened once\nmore.",
      "I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but you perceive\nthat my wife my wife s a respectable woman has been exposed to the\npersecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts,\nscoundrels....  And you must understand, the young upstarts are present\nall the while, and I have to keep the peace between them.",
      "Again I call\nout all my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an\nend, our friend the government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages\nstand on end with wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic\nwiles.",
      "Ah, he must tell you this story!",
      "said Betsy, laughing, to a lady who\ncame into her box.",
      "He has been making me laugh so.",
      "Well, _bonne chance_!",
      "she added, giving Vronsky one finger of the\nhand in which she held her fan, and with a shrug of her shoulders she\ntwitched down the bodice of her gown that had worked up, so as to be\nduly naked as she moved forward towards the footlights into the light\nof the gas, and the sight of all eyes.",
      "Vronsky drove to the French theater, where he really had to see the\ncolonel of his regiment, who never missed a single performance there.",
      "He wanted to see him, to report on the result of his mediation, which\nhad occupied and amused him for the last three days.",
      "Petritsky, whom he\nliked, was implicated in the affair, and the other culprit was a\ncapital fellow and first-rate comrade, who had lately joined the\nregiment, the young Prince Kedrov.",
      "And what was most important, the\ninterests of the regiment were involved in it too.",
      "Both the young men were in Vronsky s company.",
      "The colonel of the\nregiment was waited upon by the government clerk, Venden, with a\ncomplaint against his officers, who had insulted his wife.",
      "His young\nwife, so Venden told the story he had been married half a year was at\nchurch with her mother, and suddenly overcome by indisposition, arising\nfrom her interesting condition, she could not remain standing, she\ndrove home in the first sledge, a smart-looking one, she came across.",
      "On the spot the officers set off in pursuit of her; she was alarmed,\nand feeling still more unwell, ran up the staircase home.",
      "Venden\nhimself, on returning from his office, heard a ring at their bell and\nvoices, went out, and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter, he\nhad turned them out.",
      "He asked for exemplary punishment.",
      "Yes, it s all very well,  said the colonel to Vronsky, whom he had\ninvited to come and see him.",
      "Petritsky s becoming impossible.",
      "Not a\nweek goes by without some scandal.",
      "This government clerk won t let it\ndrop, he ll go on with the thing.",
      "Vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business, and that there could\nbe no question of a duel in it, that everything must be done to soften\nthe government clerk, and hush the matter up.",
      "The colonel had called in\nVronsky just because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent\nman, and, more than all, a man who cared for the honor of the regiment.",
      "They talked it over, and decided that Petritsky and Kedrov must go with\nVronsky to Venden s to apologize.",
      "The colonel and Vronsky were both\nfully aware that Vronsky s name and rank would be sure to contribute\ngreatly to the softening of the injured husband s feelings.",
      "And these two influences were not in fact without effect; though the\nresult remained, as Vronsky had described, uncertain.",
      "On reaching the French theater, Vronsky retired to the foyer with the\ncolonel, and reported to him his success, or non-success.",
      "The colonel,\nthinking it all over, made up his mind not to pursue the matter\nfurther, but then for his own satisfaction proceeded to cross-examine\nVronsky about his interview; and it was a long while before he could\nrestrain his laughter, as Vronsky described how the government clerk,\nafter subsiding for a while, would suddenly flare up again, as he\nrecalled the details, and how Vronsky, at the last half word of\nconciliation, skillfully man uvered a retreat, shoving Petritsky out\nbefore him.",
      "It s a disgraceful story, but killing.",
      "Kedrov really can t fight the\ngentleman!",
      "Was he so awfully hot?",
      "he commented, laughing.",
      "But what do\nyou say to Claire today?",
      "She s marvelous,  he went on, speaking of a\nnew French actress.",
      "However often you see her, every day she s\ndifferent.",
      "It s only the French who can do that.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nPrincess Betsy drove home from the theater, without waiting for the end\nof the last act.",
      "She had only just time to go into her dressing-room,\nsprinkle her long, pale face with powder, rub it, set her dress to\nrights, and order tea in the big drawing-room, when one after another\ncarriages drove up to her huge house in Bolshaia Morskaia.",
      "Her guests\nstepped out at the wide entrance, and the stout porter, who used to\nread the newspapers in the mornings behind the glass door, to the\nedification of the passers-by, noiselessly opened the immense door,\nletting the visitors pass by him into the house.",
      "Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure\nand freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other\ndoor of the drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and\na brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white\ncloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea-things.",
      "The hostess sat down at the table and took off her gloves.",
      "Chairs were\nset with the aid of footmen, moving almost imperceptibly about the\nroom; the party settled itself, divided into two groups: one round the\nsamovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the\ndrawing-room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black\nvelvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows.",
      "In both groups\nconversation wavered, as it always does, for the first few minutes,\nbroken up by meetings, greetings, offers of tea, and as it were,\nfeeling about for something to rest upon.",
      "She s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she s studied\nKaulbach,  said a diplomatic attach  in the group round the\nambassador s wife.",
      "Did you notice how she fell down?...",
      "Oh, please, don t let us talk about Nilsson!",
      "No one can possibly say\nanything new about her,  said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady,\nwithout eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress.",
      "This was\nPrincess Myakaya, noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her\nmanners, and nicknamed _enfant terrible_.",
      "Princess Myakaya, sitting in\nthe middle between the two groups, and listening to both, took part in\nthe conversation first of one and then of the other.",
      "Three people have\nused that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as\nthough they had made a compact about it.",
      "And I can t see why they liked\nthat remark so.",
      "The conversation was cut short by this observation, and a new subject\nhad to be thought of again.",
      "Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,  said the ambassador s\nwife, a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called\nby the English _small talk_.",
      "She addressed the attach , who was at a\nloss now what to begin upon.",
      "They say that that s a difficult task, that nothing s amusing that\nisn t spiteful,  he began with a smile.",
      "But I ll try.",
      "Get me a\nsubject.",
      "It all lies in the subject.",
      "If a subject s given me, it s easy\nto spin something round it.",
      "I often think that the celebrated talkers\nof the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.",
      "Everything clever is so stale.... \n\n That has been said long ago,  the ambassador s wife interrupted him,\nlaughing.",
      "The conversation began amiably, but just because it was too amiable, it\ncame to a stop again.",
      "They had to have recourse to the sure,\nnever-failing topic gossip.",
      "Don t you think there s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?",
      "he\nsaid, glancing towards a handsome, fair-haired young man, standing at\nthe table.",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "He s in the same style as the drawing-room and that s why it\nis he s so often here.",
      "This conversation was maintained, since it rested on allusions to what\ncould not be talked of in that room that is to say, of the relations of\nTushkevitch with their hostess.",
      "Round the samovar and the hostess the conversation had been meanwhile\nvacillating in just the same way between three inevitable topics: the\nlatest piece of public news, the theater, and scandal.",
      "It, too, came\nfinally to rest on the last topic, that is, ill-natured gossip.",
      "Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman the mother, not the\ndaughter has ordered a costume in _diable rose_ color?",
      "Nonsense!",
      "No, that s too lovely!",
      "I wonder that with her sense for she s not a fool, you know that she\ndoesn t see how funny she is.",
      "Everyone had something to say in censure or ridicule of the luckless\nMadame Maltishtcheva, and the conversation crackled merrily, like a\nburning faggot-stack.",
      "The husband of Princess Betsy, a good-natured fat man, an ardent\ncollector of engravings, hearing that his wife had visitors, came into\nthe drawing-room before going to his club.",
      "Stepping noiselessly over\nthe thick rugs, he went up to Princess Myakaya.",
      "How did you like Nilsson?",
      "he asked.",
      "Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that!",
      "How you startled me!",
      "she\nresponded.",
      "Please don t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing\nabout music.",
      "I d better meet you on your own ground, and talk about\nyour majolica and engravings.",
      "Come now, what treasure have you been\nbuying lately at the old curiosity shops?",
      "Would you like me to show you?",
      "But you don t understand such things.",
      "Oh, do show me!",
      "I ve been learning about them at those what s their\nnames?...",
      "the bankers ... they ve some splendid engravings.",
      "They showed\nthem to us.",
      "Why, have you been at the Sch tzburgs?",
      "asked the hostess from the\nsamovar.",
      "Yes, _ma ch re_.",
      "They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told us\nthe sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,  Princess Myakaya said,\nspeaking loudly, and conscious everyone was listening;  and very nasty\nsauce it was, some green mess.",
      "We had to ask them, and I made them\nsauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.",
      "I can t run to hundred-pound sauces.",
      "She s unique!",
      "said the lady of the house.",
      "Marvelous!",
      "said someone.",
      "The sensation produced by Princess Myakaya s speeches was always\nunique, and the secret of the sensation she produced lay in the fact\nthat though she spoke not always appropriately, as now, she said simple\nthings with some sense in them.",
      "In the society in which she lived such\nplain statements produced the effect of the wittiest epigram.",
      "Princess\nMyakaya could never see why it had that effect, but she knew it had,\nand took advantage of it.",
      "As everyone had been listening while Princess Myakaya spoke, and so the\nconversation around the ambassador s wife had dropped, Princess Betsy\ntried to bring the whole party together, and turned to the ambassador s\nwife.",
      "Will you really not have tea?",
      "You should come over here by us.",
      "No, we re very happy here,  the ambassador s wife responded with a\nsmile, and she went on with the conversation that had been begun.",
      "It was a very agreeable conversation.",
      "They were criticizing the\nKarenins, husband and wife.",
      "Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow.",
      "There s something\nstrange about her,  said her friend.",
      "The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of\nAlexey Vronsky,  said the ambassador s wife.",
      "Well, what of it?",
      "There s a fable of Grimm s about a man without a\nshadow, a man who s lost his shadow.",
      "And that s his punishment for\nsomething.",
      "I never could understand how it was a punishment.",
      "But a\nwoman must dislike being without a shadow.",
      "Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,  said Anna s\nfriend.",
      "Bad luck to your tongue!",
      "said Princess Myakaya suddenly.",
      "Madame\nKarenina s a splendid woman.",
      "I don t like her husband, but I like her\nvery much.",
      "Why don t you like her husband?",
      "He s such a remarkable man,  said the\nambassador s wife.",
      "My husband says there are few statesmen like him in\nEurope.",
      "And my husband tells me just the same, but I don t believe it,  said\nPrincess Myakaya.",
      "If our husbands didn t talk to us, we should see the\nfacts as they are.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking, is simply a\nfool.",
      "I say it in a whisper ... but doesn t it really make everything\nclear?",
      "Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept looking\nfor his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but\ndirectly I said, _he s a fool,_ though only in a whisper, everything s\nexplained, isn t it?",
      "How spiteful you are today!",
      "Not a bit.",
      "I d no other way out of it.",
      "One of the two had to be a\nfool.",
      "And, well, you know one can t say that of oneself.",
      "No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied with\nhis wit.",
      "The attach  repeated the French saying.",
      "That s just it, just it,  Princess Myakaya turned to him.",
      "But the\npoint is that I won t abandon Anna to your mercies.",
      "She s so nice, so\ncharming.",
      "How can she help it if they re all in love with her, and\nfollow her about like shadows?",
      "Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it,  Anna s friend said in\nself-defense.",
      "If no one follows us about like a shadow, that s no proof that we ve\nany right to blame her.",
      "And having duly disposed of Anna s friend, the Princess Myakaya got up,\nand together with the ambassador s wife, joined the group at the table,\nwhere the conversation was dealing with the king of Prussia.",
      "What wicked gossip were you talking over there?",
      "asked Betsy.",
      "About the Karenins.",
      "The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch,  said the ambassador s wife with a smile, as she sat\ndown at the table.",
      "Pity we didn t hear it!",
      "said Princess Betsy, glancing towards the\ndoor.",
      "Ah, here you are at last!",
      "she said, turning with a smile to\nVronsky, as he came in.",
      "Vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was\nmeeting here; he saw them all every day; and so he came in with the\nquiet manner with which one enters a room full of people from whom one\nhas only just parted.",
      "Where do I come from?",
      "he said, in answer to a question from the\nambassador s wife.",
      "Well, there s no help for it, I must confess.",
      "From\nthe _opera bouffe_.",
      "I do believe I ve seen it a hundred times, and\nalways with fresh enjoyment.",
      "It s exquisite!",
      "I know it s disgraceful,\nbut I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the _opera bouffe_ to the\nlast minute, and enjoy it.",
      "This evening....",
      "He mentioned a French actress, and was going to tell something about\nher; but the ambassador s wife, with playful horror, cut him short.",
      "Please don t tell us about that horror.",
      "All right, I won t especially as everyone knows those horrors.",
      "And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct\nthing, like the opera,  chimed in Princess Myakaya.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nSteps were heard at the door, and Princess Betsy, knowing it was Madame\nKarenina, glanced at Vronsky.",
      "He was looking towards the door, and his\nface wore a strange new expression.",
      "Joyfully, intently, and at the same\ntime timidly, he gazed at the approaching figure, and slowly he rose to\nhis feet.",
      "Anna walked into the drawing-room.",
      "Holding herself extremely\nerect, as always, looking straight before her, and moving with her\nswift, resolute, and light step, that distinguished her from all other\nsociety women, she crossed the short space to her hostess, shook hands\nwith her, smiled, and with the same smile looked around at Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her.",
      "She acknowledged this only by a slight nod, flushed a little, and\nfrowned.",
      "But immediately, while rapidly greeting her acquaintances, and\nshaking the hands proffered to her, she addressed Princess Betsy:\n\n I have been at Countess Lidia s, and meant to have come here earlier,\nbut I stayed on.",
      "Sir John was there.",
      "He s very interesting.",
      "Oh, that s this missionary?",
      "Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting things.",
      "The conversation, interrupted by her coming in, flickered up again like\nthe light of a lamp being blown out.",
      "Sir John!",
      "Yes, Sir John; I ve seen him.",
      "He speaks well.",
      "The Vlassieva\ngirl s quite in love with him.",
      "And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl s to marry Topov?",
      "Yes, they say it s quite a settled thing.",
      "I wonder at the parents!",
      "They say it s a marriage for love.",
      "For love?",
      "What antediluvian notions you have!",
      "Can one talk of love in\nthese days?",
      "said the ambassador s wife.",
      "What s to be done?",
      "It s a foolish old fashion that s kept up still, \nsaid Vronsky.",
      "So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion.",
      "The only happy\nmarriages I know are marriages of prudence.",
      "Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies\naway like dust just because that passion turns up that they have\nrefused to recognize,  said Vronsky.",
      "But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have\nsown their wild oats already.",
      "That s like scarlatina one has to go\nthrough it and get it over.",
      "Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.",
      "I was in love in my young days with a deacon,  said the Princess\nMyakaya.",
      "I don t know that it did me any good.",
      "No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes\nand then correct them,  said Princess Betsy.",
      "Even after marriage?",
      "said the ambassador s wife playfully.",
      "It s never too late to mend.",
      "The attach  repeated the English\nproverb.",
      "Just so,  Betsy agreed;  one must make mistakes and correct them.",
      "What\ndo you think about it?",
      "she turned to Anna, who, with a faintly\nperceptible resolute smile on her lips, was listening in silence to the\nconversation.",
      "I think,  said Anna, playing with the glove she had taken off,  I\nthink ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so\nmany kinds of love.",
      "Vronsky was gazing at Anna, and with a fainting heart waiting for what\nshe would say.",
      "He sighed as after a danger escaped when she uttered\nthese words.",
      "Anna suddenly turned to him.",
      "Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow.",
      "They write me that Kitty\nShtcherbatskaya s very ill. \n\n Really?",
      "said Vronsky, knitting his brows.",
      "Anna looked sternly at him.",
      "That doesn t interest you?",
      "On the contrary, it does, very much.",
      "What was it exactly they told\nyou, if I may know?",
      "he questioned.",
      "Anna got up and went to Betsy.",
      "Give me a cup of tea,  she said, standing at her table.",
      "While Betsy was pouring out the tea, Vronsky went up to Anna.",
      "What is it they write to you?",
      "he repeated.",
      "I often think men have no understanding of what s not honorable though\nthey re always talking of it,  said Anna, without answering him.",
      "I ve\nwanted to tell you so a long while,  she added, and moving a few steps\naway, she sat down at a table in a corner covered with albums.",
      "I don t quite understand the meaning of your words,  he said, handing\nher the cup.",
      "She glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.",
      "Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,  she said, not looking at him.",
      "You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.",
      "Do you suppose I don t know that I ve acted wrongly?",
      "But who was the\ncause of my doing so?",
      "What do you say that to me for?",
      "she said, glancing severely at him.",
      "You know what for,  he answered boldly and joyfully, meeting her\nglance and not dropping his eyes.",
      "Not he, but she, was confused.",
      "That only shows you have no heart,  she said.",
      "But her eyes said that\nshe knew he had a heart, and that was why she was afraid of him.",
      "What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.",
      "Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful\nword,  said Anna, with a shudder.",
      "But at once she felt that by that\nvery word  forbidden  she had shown that she acknowledged certain\nrights over him, and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of\nlove.",
      "I have long meant to tell you this,  she went on, looking\nresolutely into his eyes, and hot all over from the burning flush on\nher cheeks.",
      "I ve come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet\nyou.",
      "I have come to tell you that this must end.",
      "I have never blushed\nbefore anyone, and you force me to feel to blame for something.",
      "He looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face.",
      "What do you wish of me?",
      "he said simply and seriously.",
      "I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty s forgiveness,  she said.",
      "You don t wish that?",
      "he said.",
      "He saw she was saying what she forced herself to say, not what she\nwanted to say.",
      "If you love me, as you say,  she whispered,  do so that I may be at\npeace.",
      "His face grew radiant.",
      "Don t you know that you re all my life to me?",
      "But I know no peace, and\nI can t give it to you; all myself and love ... yes.",
      "I can t think of\nyou and myself apart.",
      "You and I are one to me.",
      "And I see no chance\nbefore us of peace for me or for you.",
      "I see a chance of despair, of\nwretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss, what bliss!...",
      "Can it be\nthere s no chance of it?",
      "he murmured with his lips; but she heard.",
      "She strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said.",
      "But\ninstead of that she let her eyes rest on him, full of love, and made no\nanswer.",
      "It s come!",
      "he thought in ecstasy.",
      "When I was beginning to despair,\nand it seemed there would be no end it s come!",
      "She loves me!",
      "She owns\nit!",
      "Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be\nfriends,  she said in words; but her eyes spoke quite differently.",
      "Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself.",
      "Whether we shall be\nthe happiest or the wretchedest of people that s in your hands.",
      "She would have said something, but he interrupted her.",
      "I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.",
      "But if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I disappear.",
      "You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.",
      "I don t want to drive you away.",
      "Only don t change anything, leave everything as it is,  he said in a\nshaky voice.",
      "Here s your husband.",
      "At that instant Alexey Alexandrovitch did in fact walk into the room\nwith his calm, awkward gait.",
      "Glancing at his wife and Vronsky, he went up to the lady of the house,\nand sitting down for a cup of tea, began talking in his deliberate,\nalways audible voice, in his habitual tone of banter, ridiculing\nsomeone.",
      "Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,  he said, looking round at all\nthe party;  the graces and the muses.",
      "But Princess Betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering,  as she\ncalled it, using the English word, and like a skillful hostess she at\nonce brought him into a serious conversation on the subject of\nuniversal conscription.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was immediately\ninterested in the subject, and began seriously defending the new\nimperial decree against Princess Betsy, who had attacked it.",
      "Vronsky and Anna still sat at the little table.",
      "This is getting indecorous,  whispered one lady, with an expressive\nglance at Madame Karenina, Vronsky, and her husband.",
      "What did I tell you?",
      "said Anna s friend.",
      "But not only those ladies, almost everyone in the room, even the\nPrincess Myakaya and Betsy herself, looked several times in the\ndirection of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle, as\nthough that were a disturbing fact.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was the only\nperson who did not once look in that direction, and was not diverted\nfrom the interesting discussion he had entered upon.",
      "Noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone,\nPrincess Betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, and went up to Anna.",
      "I m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband s\nlanguage,  she said.",
      "The most transcendental ideas seem to be within\nmy grasp when he s speaking.",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "said Anna, radiant with a smile of happiness, and not\nunderstanding a word of what Betsy had said.",
      "She crossed over to the\nbig table and took part in the general conversation.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, after staying half an hour, went up to his wife\nand suggested that they should go home together.",
      "But she answered, not\nlooking at him, that she was staying to supper.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nmade his bows and withdrew.",
      "The fat old Tatar, Madame Karenina s coachman, was with difficulty\nholding one of her pair of grays, chilled with the cold and rearing at\nthe entrance.",
      "A footman stood opening the carriage door.",
      "The\nhall-porter stood holding open the great door of the house.",
      "Anna\nArkadyevna, with her quick little hand, was unfastening the lace of her\nsleeve, caught in the hook of her fur cloak, and with bent head\nlistening to the words Vronsky murmured as he escorted her down.",
      "You ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,  he was saying;\n but you know that friendship s not what I want: that there s only one\nhappiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so ... yes,\nlove!...",
      "Love,  she repeated slowly, in an inner voice, and suddenly, at the\nvery instant she unhooked the lace, she added,  Why I don t like the\nword is that it means too much to me, far more than you can\nunderstand,  and she glanced into his face.",
      "_Au revoir!_ \n\nShe gave him her hand, and with her rapid, springy step she passed by\nthe porter and vanished into the carriage.",
      "Her glance, the touch of her hand, set him aflame.",
      "He kissed the palm\nof his hand where she had touched it, and went home, happy in the sense\nthat he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than\nduring the last two months.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact\nthat his wife was sitting with Vronsky at a table apart, in eager\nconversation with him about something.",
      "But he noticed that to the rest\nof the party this appeared something striking and improper, and for\nthat reason it seemed to him too to be improper.",
      "He made up his mind\nthat he must speak of it to his wife.",
      "On reaching home Alexey Alexandrovitch went to his study, as he usually\ndid, seated himself in his low chair, opened a book on the Papacy at\nthe place where he had laid the paper-knife in it, and read till one\no clock, just as he usually did.",
      "But from time to time he rubbed his\nhigh forehead and shook his head, as though to drive away something.",
      "At\nhis usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night.",
      "Anna\nArkadyevna had not yet come in.",
      "With a book under his arm he went\nupstairs.",
      "But this evening, instead of his usual thoughts and\nmeditations upon official details, his thoughts were absorbed by his\nwife and something disagreeable connected with her.",
      "Contrary to his\nusual habit, he did not get into bed, but fell to walking up and down\nthe rooms with his hands clasped behind his back.",
      "He could not go to\nbed, feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think\nthoroughly over the position that had just arisen.",
      "When Alexey Alexandrovitch had made up his mind that he must talk to\nhis wife about it, it had seemed a very easy and simple matter.",
      "But\nnow, when he began to think over the question that had just presented\nitself, it seemed to him very complicated and difficult.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was not jealous.",
      "Jealousy according to his\nnotions was an insult to one s wife, and one ought to have confidence\nin one s wife.",
      "Why one ought to have confidence that is to say,\ncomplete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did\nnot ask himself.",
      "But he had no experience of lack of confidence,\nbecause he had confidence in her, and told himself that he ought to\nhave it.",
      "Now, though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful\nfeeling and that one ought to feel confidence, had not broken down, he\nfelt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and\nirrational, and did not know what was to be done.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nwas standing face to face with life, with the possibility of his wife s\nloving someone other than himself, and this seemed to him very\nirrational and incomprehensible because it was life itself.",
      "All his\nlife Alexey Alexandrovitch had lived and worked in official spheres,\nhaving to do with the reflection of life.",
      "And every time he had\nstumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it.",
      "Now he\nexperienced a feeling akin to that of a man who, while calmly crossing\na precipice by a bridge, should suddenly discover that the bridge is\nbroken, and that there is a chasm below.",
      "That chasm was life itself,\nthe bridge that artificial life in which Alexey Alexandrovitch had\nlived.",
      "For the first time the question presented itself to him of the\npossibility of his wife s loving someone else, and he was horrified at\nit.",
      "He did not undress, but walked up and down with his regular tread over\nthe resounding parquet of the dining-room, where one lamp was burning,\nover the carpet of the dark drawing-room, in which the light was\nreflected on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa, and\nacross her boudoir, where two candles burned, lighting up the portraits\nof her parents and woman friends, and the pretty knick-knacks of her\nwriting-table, that he knew so well.",
      "He walked across her boudoir to\nthe bedroom door, and turned back again.",
      "At each turn in his walk,\nespecially at the parquet of the lighted dining-room, he halted and\nsaid to himself,  Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must\nexpress my view of it and my decision.",
      "And he turned back again.",
      "But\nexpress what what decision?",
      "he said to himself in the drawing-room,\nand he found no reply.",
      "But after all,  he asked himself before turning\ninto the boudoir,  what has occurred?",
      "Nothing.",
      "She was talking a long\nwhile with him.",
      "But what of that?",
      "Surely women in society can talk to\nwhom they please.",
      "And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and\nher,  he told himself as he went into her boudoir; but this dictum,\nwhich had always had such weight with him before, had now no weight and\nno meaning at all.",
      "And from the bedroom door he turned back again; but\nas he entered the dark drawing-room some inner voice told him that it\nwas not so, and that if others noticed it that showed that there was\nsomething.",
      "And he said to himself again in the dining-room,  Yes, I\nmust decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it....  And\nagain at the turn in the drawing-room he asked himself,  Decide how?",
      "And again he asked himself,  What had occurred?",
      "and answered,\n Nothing,  and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his\nwife; but again in the drawing-room he was convinced that something had\nhappened.",
      "His thoughts, like his body, went round a complete circle,\nwithout coming upon anything new.",
      "He noticed this, rubbed his forehead,\nand sat down in her boudoir.",
      "There, looking at her table, with the malachite blotting case lying at\nthe top and an unfinished letter, his thoughts suddenly changed.",
      "He\nbegan to think of her, of what she was thinking and feeling.",
      "For the\nfirst time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life, her ideas,\nher desires, and the idea that she could and should have a separate\nlife of her own seemed to him so alarming that he made haste to dispel\nit.",
      "It was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into.",
      "To put himself\nin thought and feeling in another person s place was a spiritual\nexercise not natural to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He looked on this\nspiritual exercise as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy.",
      "And the worst of it all,  thought he,  is that just now, at the very\nmoment when my great work is approaching completion  (he was thinking\nof the project he was bringing forward at the time),  when I stand in\nneed of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid\nworry should fall foul of me.",
      "But what s to be done?",
      "I m not one of\nthose men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force\nof character to face them.",
      "I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind, \nhe said aloud.",
      "The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in\nher soul, that s not my affair; that s the affair of her conscience,\nand falls under the head of religion,  he said to himself, feeling\nconsolation in the sense that he had found to which division of\nregulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred.",
      "And so,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself,  questions as to her\nfeelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can\nhave nothing to do.",
      "My duty is clearly defined.",
      "As the head of the\nfamily, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in\npart the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I\nperceive, to warn her, even to use my authority.",
      "I ought to speak\nplainly to her.",
      "And everything that he would say tonight to his wife\ntook clear shape in Alexey Alexandrovitch s head.",
      "Thinking over what he\nwould say, he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time\nand mental powers for domestic consumption, with so little to show for\nit, but, in spite of that, the form and contents of the speech before\nhim shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a\nministerial report.",
      "I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition\nof the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly,\nexposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be,\nreference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly,\nreference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.",
      "And,\ninterlacing his fingers, Alexey Alexandrovitch stretched them, and the\njoints of the fingers cracked.",
      "This trick, a bad habit, the cracking of\nhis fingers, always soothed him, and gave precision to his thoughts, so\nneedful to him at this juncture.",
      "There was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch halted in the middle of the room.",
      "A woman s step was heard mounting the stairs.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nready for his speech, stood compressing his crossed fingers, waiting to\nsee if the crack would not come again.",
      "One joint cracked.",
      "Already, from the sound of light steps on the stairs, he was aware that\nshe was close, and though he was satisfied with his speech, he felt\nfrightened of the explanation confronting him....\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nAnna came in with hanging head, playing with the tassels of her hood.",
      "Her face was brilliant and glowing; but this glow was not one of\nbrightness; it suggested the fearful glow of a conflagration in the\nmidst of a dark night.",
      "On seeing her husband, Anna raised her head and\nsmiled, as though she had just waked up.",
      "You re not in bed?",
      "What a wonder!",
      "she said, letting fall her hood,\nand without stopping, she went on into the dressing-room.",
      "It s late,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch,  she said, when she had gone through the\ndoorway.",
      "Anna, it s necessary for me to have a talk with you.",
      "With me?",
      "she said, wonderingly.",
      "She came out from behind the door of\nthe dressing-room, and looked at him.",
      "Why, what is it?",
      "What about?",
      "she asked, sitting down.",
      "Well, let s talk, if it s so necessary.",
      "But\nit would be better to get to sleep.",
      "Anna said what came to her lips, and marveled, hearing herself, at her\nown capacity for lying.",
      "How simple and natural were her words, and how\nlikely that she was simply sleepy!",
      "She felt herself clad in an\nimpenetrable armor of falsehood.",
      "She felt that some unseen force had\ncome to her aid and was supporting her.",
      "Anna, I must warn you,  he began.",
      "Warn me?",
      "she said.",
      "Of what?",
      "She looked at him so simply, so brightly, that anyone who did not know\nher as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural,\neither in the sound or the sense of her words.",
      "But to him, knowing her,\nknowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual, she\nnoticed it, and asked him the reason; to him, knowing that every joy,\nevery pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once;\nto him, now to see that she did not care to notice his state of mind,\nthat she did not care to say a word about herself, meant a great deal.",
      "He saw that the inmost recesses of her soul, that had always hitherto\nlain open before him, were closed against him.",
      "More than that, he saw\nfrom her tone that she was not even perturbed at that, but as it were\nsaid straight out to him:  Yes, it s shut up, and so it must be, and\nwill be in future.",
      "Now he experienced a feeling such as a man might\nhave, returning home and finding his own house locked up.",
      "But perhaps\nthe key may yet be found,  thought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I want to warn you,  he said in a low voice,  that through\nthoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked\nabout in society.",
      "Your too animated conversation this evening with\nCount Vronsky  (he enunciated the name firmly and with deliberate\nemphasis)  attracted attention.",
      "He talked and looked at her laughing eyes, which frightened him now\nwith their impenetrable look, and, as he talked, he felt all the\nuselessness and idleness of his words.",
      "You re always like that,  she answered, as though completely\nmisapprehending him, and of all he had said only taking in the last\nphrase.",
      "One time you don t like my being dull, and another time you\ndon t like my being lively.",
      "I wasn t dull.",
      "Does that offend you?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch shivered, and bent his hands to make the joints\ncrack.",
      "Oh, please, don t do that, I do so dislike it,  she said.",
      "Anna, is this you?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, quietly making an\neffort over himself, and restraining the motion of his fingers.",
      "But what is it all about?",
      "she said, with such genuine and droll\nwonder.",
      "What do you want of me?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused, and rubbed his forehead and his eyes.",
      "He\nsaw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say, warning\nhis wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had\nunconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her\nconscience, and was struggling against the barrier he fancied between\nthem.",
      "This is what I meant to say to you,  he went on coldly and composedly,\n and I beg you to listen to it.",
      "I consider jealousy, as you know, a\nhumiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be\ninfluenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot\nbe disregarded with impunity.",
      "This evening it was not I observed it,\nbut judging by the impression made on the company, everyone observed\nthat your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be\ndesired.",
      "I positively don t understand,  said Anna, shrugging her shoulders He\ndoesn t care,  she thought.",
      "But other people noticed it, and that s\nwhat upsets him.",
      "You re not well, Alexey Alexandrovitch,  she added,\nand she got up, and would have gone towards the door; but he moved\nforward as though he would stop her.",
      "His face was ugly and forbidding, as Anna had never seen him.",
      "She\nstopped, and bending her head back and on one side, began with her\nrapid hand taking out her hairpins.",
      "Well, I m listening to what s to come,  she said, calmly and\nironically;  and indeed I listen with interest, for I should like to\nunderstand what s the matter.",
      "She spoke, and marveled at the confident, calm, and natural tone in\nwhich she was speaking, and the choice of the words she used.",
      "To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and\nbesides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,  began Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Ferreting in one s soul, one often ferrets out\nsomething that might have lain there unnoticed.",
      "Your feelings are an\naffair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to\nmyself, and to God, to point out to you your duties.",
      "Our life has been\njoined, not by man, but by God.",
      "That union can only be severed by a\ncrime, and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement.",
      "I don t understand a word.",
      "And, oh dear!",
      "how sleepy I am, unluckily, \nshe said, rapidly passing her hand through her hair, feeling for the\nremaining hairpins.",
      "Anna, for God s sake don t speak like that!",
      "he said gently.",
      "Perhaps\nI am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as\nfor you.",
      "I am your husband, and I love you.",
      "For an instant her face fell, and the mocking gleam in her eyes died\naway; but the word _love_ threw her into revolt again.",
      "She thought:\n Love?",
      "Can he love?",
      "If he hadn t heard there was such a thing as love,\nhe would never have used the word.",
      "He doesn t even know what love is.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don t understand,  she said.",
      "Define\nwhat it is you find....",
      "Pardon, let me say all I have to say.",
      "I love you.",
      "But I am not\nspeaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our\nson and yourself.",
      "It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to\nyou utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are\ncalled forth by my mistaken impression.",
      "In that case, I beg you to\nforgive me.",
      "But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest\nfoundation for them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your\nheart prompts you, to speak out to me.... \n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike\nwhat he had prepared.",
      "I have nothing to say.",
      "And besides,  she said hurriedly, with\ndifficulty repressing a smile,  it s really time to be in bed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, and, without saying more, went into the\nbedroom.",
      "When she came into the bedroom, he was already in bed.",
      "His lips were\nsternly compressed, and his eyes looked away from her.",
      "Anna got into\nher bed, and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to\nher again.",
      "She both feared his speaking and wished for it.",
      "But he was\nsilent.",
      "She waited for a long while without moving, and had forgotten\nabout him.",
      "She thought of that other; she pictured him, and felt how\nher heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of\nhim.",
      "Suddenly she heard an even, tranquil snore.",
      "For the first instant\nAlexey Alexandrovitch seemed, as it were, appalled at his own snoring,\nand ceased; but after an interval of two breathings the snore sounded\nagain, with a new tranquil rhythm.",
      "It s late, it s late,  she whispered with a smile.",
      "A long while she\nlay, not moving, with open eyes, whose brilliance she almost fancied\nshe could herself see in the darkness.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nFrom that time a new life began for Alexey Alexandrovitch and for his\nwife.",
      "Nothing special happened.",
      "Anna went out into society, as she had\nalways done, was particularly often at Princess Betsy s, and met\nVronsky everywhere.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch saw this, but could do\nnothing.",
      "All his efforts to draw her into open discussion she\nconfronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate, made up of a\nsort of amused perplexity.",
      "Outwardly everything was the same, but their\ninner relations were completely changed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, a man\nof great power in the world of politics, felt himself helpless in this.",
      "Like an ox with head bent, submissively he awaited the blow which he\nfelt was lifted over him.",
      "Every time he began to think about it, he\nfelt that he must try once more, that by kindness, tenderness, and\npersuasion there was still hope of saving her, of bringing her back to\nherself, and every day he made ready to talk to her.",
      "But every time he\nbegan talking to her, he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit, which\nhad taken possession of her, had possession of him too, and he talked\nto her in a tone quite unlike that in which he had meant to talk.",
      "Involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of jeering at\nanyone who should say what he was saying.",
      "And in that tone it was\nimpossible to say what needed to be said to her.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nThat which for Vronsky had been almost a whole year the one absorbing\ndesire of his life, replacing all his old desires; that which for Anna\nhad been an impossible, terrible, and even for that reason more\nentrancing dream of bliss, that desire had been fulfilled.",
      "He stood\nbefore her, pale, his lower jaw quivering, and besought her to be calm,\nnot knowing how or why.",
      "Anna!",
      "Anna!",
      "he said with a choking voice,  Anna, for pity s sake!...",
      "But the louder he spoke, the lower she dropped her once proud and gay,\nnow shame-stricken head, and she bowed down and sank from the sofa\nwhere she was sitting, down on the floor, at his feet; she would have\nfallen on the carpet if he had not held her.",
      "My God!",
      "Forgive me!",
      "she said, sobbing, pressing his hands to her\nbosom.",
      "She felt so sinful, so guilty, that nothing was left her but to\nhumiliate herself and beg forgiveness; and as now there was no one in\nher life but him, to him she addressed her prayer for forgiveness.",
      "Looking at him, she had a physical sense of her humiliation, and she\ncould say nothing more.",
      "He felt what a murderer must feel, when he sees\nthe body he has robbed of life.",
      "That body, robbed by him of life, was\ntheir love, the first stage of their love.",
      "There was something awful\nand revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful\nprice of shame.",
      "Shame at their spiritual nakedness crushed her and\ninfected him.",
      "But in spite of all the murderer s horror before the body\nof his victim, he must hack it to pieces, hide the body, must use what\nhe has gained by his murder.",
      "And with fury, as it were with passion, the murderer falls on the body,\nand drags it and hacks at it; so he covered her face and shoulders with\nkisses.",
      "She held his hand, and did not stir.",
      "Yes, these kisses that is\nwhat has been bought by this shame.",
      "Yes, and one hand, which will\nalways be mine the hand of my accomplice.",
      "She lifted up that hand and\nkissed it.",
      "He sank on his knees and tried to see her face; but she hid\nit, and said nothing.",
      "At last, as though making an effort over herself,\nshe got up and pushed him away.",
      "Her face was still as beautiful, but it\nwas only the more pitiful for that.",
      "All is over,  she said;  I have nothing but you.",
      "Remember that.",
      "I can never forget what is my whole life.",
      "For one instant of this\nhappiness.... \n\n Happiness!",
      "she said with horror and loathing and her horror\nunconsciously infected him.",
      "For pity s sake, not a word, not a word\nmore.",
      "She rose quickly and moved away from him.",
      "Not a word more,  she repeated, and with a look of chill despair,\nincomprehensible to him, she parted from him.",
      "She felt that at that\nmoment she could not put into words the sense of shame, of rapture, and\nof horror at this stepping into a new life, and she did not want to\nspeak of it, to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words.",
      "But\nlater too, and the next day and the third day, she still found no words\nin which she could express the complexity of her feelings; indeed, she\ncould not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all\nthat was in her soul.",
      "She said to herself:  No, just now I can t think of it, later on, when\nI am calmer.",
      "But this calm for thought never came; every time the\nthought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her, and\nwhat she ought to do, a horror came over her and she drove those\nthoughts away.",
      "Later, later,  she said when I am calmer.",
      "But in dreams, when she had no control over her thoughts, her position\npresented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness.",
      "One dream haunted\nher almost every night.",
      "She dreamed that both were her husbands at\nonce, that both were lavishing caresses on her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nwas weeping, kissing her hands, and saying,  How happy we are now!",
      "And\nAlexey Vronsky was there too, and he too was her husband.",
      "And she was\nmarveling that it had once seemed impossible to her, was explaining to\nthem, laughing, that this was ever so much simpler, and that now both\nof them were happy and contented.",
      "But this dream weighed on her like a\nnightmare, and she awoke from it in terror.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nIn the early days after his return from Moscow, whenever Levin\nshuddered and grew red, remembering the disgrace of his rejection, he\nsaid to himself:  This was just how I used to shudder and blush,\nthinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not\nget my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had\nmismanaged that affair of my sister s that was entrusted to me.",
      "And\nyet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could\ndistress me so much.",
      "It will be the same thing too with this trouble.",
      "Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.",
      "But three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it;\nand it was as painful for him to think of it as it had been those first\ndays.",
      "He could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family\nlife, and feeling himself so ripe for it, he was still not married, and\nwas further than ever from marriage.",
      "He was painfully conscious\nhimself, as were all about him, that at his years it is not well for\nman to be alone.",
      "He remembered how before starting for Moscow he had\nonce said to his cowman Nikolay, a simple-hearted peasant, whom he\nliked talking to:  Well, Nikolay!",
      "I mean to get married,  and how\nNikolay had promptly answered, as of a matter on which there could be\nno possible doubt:  And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "But\nmarriage had now become further off than ever.",
      "The place was taken, and\nwhenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place, he\nfelt that it was utterly impossible.",
      "Moreover, the recollection of the\nrejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with\nshame.",
      "However often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in\nit, that recollection, like other humiliating reminiscences of a\nsimilar kind, made him twinge and blush.",
      "There had been in his past, as\nin every man s, actions, recognized by him as bad, for which his\nconscience ought to have tormented him; but the memory of these evil\nactions was far from causing him so much suffering as those trivial but\nhumiliating reminiscences.",
      "These wounds never healed.",
      "And with these\nmemories was now ranged his rejection and the pitiful position in which\nhe must have appeared to others that evening.",
      "But time and work did\ntheir part.",
      "Bitter memories were more and more covered up by the\nincidents paltry in his eyes, but really important of his country life.",
      "Every week he thought less often of Kitty.",
      "He was impatiently looking\nforward to the news that she was married, or just going to be married,\nhoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure\nhim.",
      "Meanwhile spring came on, beautiful and kindly, without the delays and\ntreacheries of spring, one of those rare springs in which plants,\nbeasts, and man rejoice alike.",
      "This lovely spring roused Levin still\nmore, and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past\nand building up his lonely life firmly and independently.",
      "Though many\nof the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been\ncarried out, still his most important resolution that of purity had\nbeen kept by him.",
      "He was free from that shame, which had usually\nharassed him after a fall; and he could look everyone straight in the\nface.",
      "In February he had received a letter from Marya Nikolaevna\ntelling him that his brother Nikolay s health was getting worse, but\nthat he would not take advice, and in consequence of this letter Levin\nwent to Moscow to his brother s and succeeded in persuading him to see\na doctor and to go to a watering-place abroad.",
      "He succeeded so well in\npersuading his brother, and in lending him money for the journey\nwithout irritating him, that he was satisfied with himself in that\nmatter.",
      "In addition to his farming, which called for special attention\nin spring, and in addition to reading, Levin had begun that winter a\nwork on agriculture, the plan of which turned on taking into account\nthe character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data\nof the question, like the climate and the soil, and consequently\ndeducing all the principles of scientific culture, not simply from the\ndata of soil and climate, but from the data of soil, climate, and a\ncertain unalterable character of the laborer.",
      "Thus, in spite of his\nsolitude, or in consequence of his solitude, his life was exceedingly\nfull.",
      "Only rarely he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate\nhis stray ideas to someone besides Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "With her indeed he\nnot infrequently fell into discussion upon physics, the theory of\nagriculture, and especially philosophy; philosophy was Agafea\nMihalovna s favorite subject.",
      "Spring was slow in unfolding.",
      "For the last few weeks it had been\nsteadily fine frosty weather.",
      "In the daytime it thawed in the sun, but\nat night there were even seven degrees of frost.",
      "There was such a\nfrozen surface on the snow that they drove the wagons anywhere off the\nroads.",
      "Easter came in the snow.",
      "Then all of a sudden, on Easter Monday,\na warm wind sprang up, storm clouds swooped down, and for three days\nand three nights the warm, driving rain fell in streams.",
      "On Thursday\nthe wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though\nhiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in\nnature.",
      "Behind the fog there was the flowing of water, the cracking and\nfloating of ice, the swift rush of turbid, foaming torrents; and on the\nfollowing Monday, in the evening, the fog parted, the storm clouds\nsplit up into little curling crests of cloud, the sky cleared, and the\nreal spring had come.",
      "In the morning the sun rose brilliant and quickly\nwore away the thin layer of ice that covered the water, and all the\nwarm air was quivering with the steam that rose up from the quickened\nearth.",
      "The old grass looked greener, and the young grass thrust up its\ntiny blades; the buds of the guelder-rose and of the currant and the\nsticky birch-buds were swollen with sap, and an exploring bee was\nhumming about the golden blossoms that studded the willow.",
      "Larks\ntrilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered\nstubble-land; peewits wailed over the low lands and marshes flooded by\nthe pools; cranes and wild geese flew high across the sky uttering\ntheir spring calls.",
      "The cattle, bald in patches where the new hair had\nnot grown yet, lowed in the pastures; the bowlegged lambs frisked round\ntheir bleating mothers.",
      "Nimble children ran about the drying paths,\ncovered with the prints of bare feet.",
      "There was a merry chatter of\npeasant women over their linen at the pond, and the ring of axes in the\nyard, where the peasants were repairing ploughs and harrows.",
      "The real\nspring had come.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nLevin put on his big boots, and, for the first time, a cloth jacket,\ninstead of his fur cloak, and went out to look after his farm, stepping\nover streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his\neyes, and treading one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud.",
      "Spring is the time of plans and projects.",
      "And, as he came out into the\nfarmyard, Levin, like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be\ntaken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds,\nhardly knew what undertakings he was going to begin upon now in the\nfarm work that was so dear to him.",
      "But he felt that he was full of the\nmost splendid plans and projects.",
      "First of all he went to the cattle.",
      "The cows had been let out into their paddock, and their smooth sides\nwere already shining with their new, sleek, spring coats; they basked\nin the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow.",
      "Levin gazed admiringly\nat the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their\ncondition, and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow,\nand the calves to be let into the paddock.",
      "The herdsman ran gaily to\nget ready for the meadow.",
      "The cowherd girls, picking up their\npetticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white,\nnot yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing\nthe calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring.",
      "After admiring the young ones of that year, who were particularly\nfine the early calves were the size of a peasant s cow, and Pava s\ndaughter, at three months old, was as big as a yearling Levin gave\norders for a trough to be brought out and for them to be fed in the\npaddock.",
      "But it appeared that as the paddock had not been used during\nthe winter, the hurdles made in the autumn for it were broken.",
      "He sent\nfor the carpenter, who, according to his orders, ought to have been at\nwork at the thrashing machine.",
      "But it appeared that the carpenter was\nrepairing the harrows, which ought to have been repaired before Lent.",
      "This was very annoying to Levin.",
      "It was annoying to come upon that\neverlasting slovenliness in the farm work against which he had been\nstriving with all his might for so many years.",
      "The hurdles, as he\nascertained, being not wanted in winter, had been carried to the\ncart-horses  stable; and there broken, as they were of light\nconstruction, only meant for feeding calves.",
      "Moreover, it was apparent\nalso that the harrows and all the agricultural implements, which he had\ndirected to be looked over and repaired in the winter, for which very\npurpose he had hired three carpenters, had not been put into repair,\nand the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been\nharrowing the field.",
      "Levin sent for his bailiff, but immediately went\noff himself to look for him.",
      "The bailiff, beaming all over, like\neveryone that day, in a sheepskin bordered with astrachan, came out of\nthe barn, twisting a bit of straw in his hands.",
      "Why isn t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?",
      "Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing.",
      "Here\nit s time they got to work in the fields.",
      "But what were they doing in the winter, then?",
      "But what did you want the carpenter for?",
      "Where are the hurdles for the calves  paddock?",
      "I ordered them to be got ready.",
      "What would you have with those\npeasants!",
      "said the bailiff, with a wave of his hand.",
      "It s not those peasants but this bailiff!",
      "said Levin, getting angry.",
      "Why, what do I keep you for?",
      "he cried.",
      "But, bethinking himself that\nthis would not help matters, he stopped short in the middle of a\nsentence, and merely sighed.",
      "Well, what do you say?",
      "Can sowing begin?",
      "he asked, after a pause.",
      "Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.",
      "And the clover?",
      "I ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they re sowing.",
      "Only I don t know if\nthey ll manage to get through; it s so slushy.",
      "How many acres?",
      "About fifteen.",
      "Why not sow all?",
      "cried Levin.",
      "That they were only sowing the clover on fifteen acres, not on all the\nforty-five, was still more annoying to him.",
      "Clover, as he knew, both\nfrom books and from his own experience, never did well except when it\nwas sown as early as possible, almost in the snow.",
      "And yet Levin could\nnever get this done.",
      "There s no one to send.",
      "What would you have with such a set of\npeasants?",
      "Three haven t turned up.",
      "And there s Semyon.... \n\n Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.",
      "And so I have, as it is.",
      "Where are the peasants, then?",
      "Five are making comp te  (which meant compost),  four are shifting the\noats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.",
      "Levin knew very well that  a touch of mildew  meant that his English\nseed oats were already ruined.",
      "Again they had not done as he had\nordered.",
      "Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,  he cried.",
      "Don t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.",
      "Levin waved his hand angrily, went into the granary to glance at the\noats, and then to the stable.",
      "The oats were not yet spoiled.",
      "But the\npeasants were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let\nthem slide down into the lower granary; and arranging for this to be\ndone, and taking two workmen from there for sowing clover, Levin got\nover his vexation with the bailiff.",
      "Indeed, it was such a lovely day\nthat one could not be angry.",
      "Ignat!",
      "he called to the coachman, who, with his sleeves tucked up,\nwas washing the carriage wheels,  saddle me....",
      "Which, sir?",
      "Well, let it be Kolpik.",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "While they were saddling his horse, Levin again called up the bailiff,\nwho was hanging about in sight, to make it up with him, and began\ntalking to him about the spring operations before them, and his plans\nfor the farm.",
      "The wagons were to begin carting manure earlier, so as to get all done\nbefore the early mowing.",
      "And the ploughing of the further land to go on\nwithout a break so as to let it ripen lying fallow.",
      "And the mowing to\nbe all done by hired labor, not on half-profits.",
      "The bailiff listened\nattentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of his employer s\nprojects.",
      "But still he had that look Levin knew so well that always\nirritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency.",
      "That look said:\n That s all very well, but as God wills.",
      "Nothing mortified Levin so much as that tone.",
      "But it was the tone\ncommon to all the bailiffs he had ever had.",
      "They had all taken up that\nattitude to his plans, and so now he was not angered by it, but\nmortified, and felt all the more roused to struggle against this, as it\nseemed, elemental force continually ranged against him, for which he\ncould find no other expression than  as God wills.",
      "If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  said the bailiff.",
      "Why ever shouldn t you manage it?",
      "We positively must have another fifteen laborers.",
      "And they don t turn\nup.",
      "There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.",
      "Levin was silent.",
      "Again he was brought face to face with that opposing\nforce.",
      "He knew that however much they tried, they could not hire more\nthan forty thirty-seven perhaps or thirty-eight laborers for a\nreasonable sum.",
      "Some forty had been taken on, and there were no more.",
      "But still he could not help struggling against it.",
      "Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don t come we must look for\nthem.",
      "Oh, I ll send, to be sure,  said Vassily Fedorovitch despondently.",
      "But there are the horses, too, they re not good for much.",
      "We ll get some more.",
      "I know, of course,  Levin added laughing,  you\nalways want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but\nthis year I m not going to let you have things your own way.",
      "I ll see\nto everything myself.",
      "Why, I don t think you take much rest as it is.",
      "It cheers us up to\nwork under the master s eye....",
      "So they re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale?",
      "I ll go and have a\nlook at them,  he said, getting on to the little bay cob, Kolpik, who\nwas led up by the coachman.",
      "You can t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  the\ncoachman shouted.",
      "All right, I ll go by the forest.",
      "And Levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out\ninto the open country, his good little horse, after his long\ninactivity, stepping out gallantly, snorting over the pools, and\nasking, as it were, for guidance.",
      "If Levin had felt happy before in the\ncattle pens and farmyard, he felt happier yet in the open country.",
      "Swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob,\ndrinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air, as he\nrode through his forest over the crumbling, wasted snow, still left in\nparts, and covered with dissolving tracks, he rejoiced over every tree,\nwith the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots.",
      "When he came out of the forest, in the immense plain before him, his\ngrass fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green, without one bare\nplace or swamp, only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches\nof melting snow.",
      "He was not put out of temper even by the sight of the\npeasants  horses and colts trampling down his young grass (he told a\npeasant he met to drive them out), nor by the sarcastic and stupid\nreply of the peasant Ipat, whom he met on the way, and asked,  Well,\nIpat, shall we soon be sowing?",
      "We must get the ploughing done first,\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch,  answered Ipat.",
      "The further he rode, the\nhappier he became, and plans for the land rose to his mind each better\nthan the last; to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern\nborders, so that the snow should not lie under them; to divide them up\ninto six fields of arable and three of pasture and hay; to build a\ncattle yard at the further end of the estate, and to dig a pond and to\nconstruct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land.",
      "And then eight hundred acres of wheat, three hundred of potatoes, and\nfour hundred of clover, and not one acre exhausted.",
      "Absorbed in such dreams, carefully keeping his horse by the hedges, so\nas not to trample his young crops, he rode up to the laborers who had\nbeen sent to sow clover.",
      "A cart with the seed in it was standing, not\nat the edge, but in the middle of the crop, and the winter corn had\nbeen torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse.",
      "Both the laborers\nwere sitting in the hedge, probably smoking a pipe together.",
      "The earth\nin the cart, with which the seed was mixed, was not crushed to powder,\nbut crusted together or adhering in clods.",
      "Seeing the master, the\nlaborer, Vassily, went towards the cart, while Mishka set to work\nsowing.",
      "This was not as it should be, but with the laborers Levin\nseldom lost his temper.",
      "When Vassily came up, Levin told him to lead\nthe horse to the hedge.",
      "It s all right, sir, it ll spring up again,  responded Vassily.",
      "Please don t argue,  said Levin,  but do as you re told.",
      "Yes, sir,  answered Vassily, and he took the horse s head.",
      "What a\nsowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  he said, hesitating;  first rate.",
      "Only it s a work to get about!",
      "You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.",
      "Why is it you have earth that s not sifted?",
      "said Levin.",
      "Well, we crumble it up,  answered Vassily, taking up some seed and\nrolling the earth in his palms.",
      "Vassily was not to blame for their having filled up his cart with\nunsifted earth, but still it was annoying.",
      "Levin had more than once already tried a way he knew for stifling his\nanger, and turning all that seemed dark right again, and he tried that\nway now.",
      "He watched how Mishka strode along, swinging the huge clods of\nearth that clung to each foot; and getting off his horse, he took the\nsieve from Vassily and started sowing himself.",
      "Where did you stop?",
      "Vassily pointed to the mark with his foot, and Levin went forward as\nbest he could, scattering the seed on the land.",
      "Walking was as\ndifficult as on a bog, and by the time Levin had ended the row he was\nin a great heat, and he stopped and gave up the sieve to Vassily.",
      "Well, master, when summer s here, mind you don t scold me for these\nrows,  said Vassily.",
      "Eh?",
      "said Levin cheerily, already feeling the effect of his method.",
      "Why, you ll see in the summer time.",
      "It ll look different.",
      "Look you\nwhere I sowed last spring.",
      "How I did work at it!",
      "I do my best,\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, d ye see, as I would for my own father.",
      "I\ndon t like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it.",
      "What s\ngood for the master s good for us too.",
      "To look out yonder now,  said\nVassily, pointing,  it does one s heart good.",
      "It s a lovely spring, Vassily.",
      "Why, it s a spring such as the old men don t remember the like of.",
      "I\nwas up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of\nit.",
      "He was saying you wouldn t know it from rye.",
      "Have you been sowing wheat long?",
      "Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last.",
      "You gave me two\nmeasures.",
      "We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.",
      "Well, mind you crumble up the clods,  said Levin, going towards his\nhorse,  and keep an eye on Mishka.",
      "And if there s a good crop you shall\nhave half a rouble for every acre.",
      "Humbly thankful.",
      "We are very well content, sir, as it is.",
      "Levin got on his horse and rode towards the field where was last year s\nclover, and the one which was ploughed ready for the spring corn.",
      "The crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent.",
      "It had\nsurvived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken\nstalks of last year s wheat.",
      "The horse sank in up to the pasterns, and\nhe drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the half-thawed ground.",
      "Over the ploughland riding was utterly impossible; the horse could only\nkeep a foothold where there was ice, and in the thawing furrows he sank\ndeep in at each step.",
      "The ploughland was in splendid condition; in a\ncouple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing.",
      "Everything was\ncapital, everything was cheering.",
      "Levin rode back across the streams,\nhoping the water would have gone down.",
      "And he did in fact get across,\nand startled two ducks.",
      "There must be snipe too,  he thought, and just\nas he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper, who\nconfirmed his theory about the snipe.",
      "Levin went home at a trot, so as to have time to eat his dinner and get\nhis gun ready for the evening.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nAs he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind, Levin heard\nthe bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house.",
      "Yes, that s someone from the railway station,  he thought,  just the\ntime to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be?",
      "What if it s\nbrother Nikolay?",
      "He did say:  Maybe I ll go to the waters, or maybe\nI ll come down to you.",
      "He felt dismayed and vexed for the first\nminute, that his brother Nikolay s presence should come to disturb his\nhappy mood of spring.",
      "But he felt ashamed of the feeling, and at once\nhe opened, as it were, the arms of his soul, and with a softened\nfeeling of joy and expectation, now he hoped with all his heart that it\nwas his brother.",
      "He pricked up his horse, and riding out from behind\nthe acacias he saw a hired three-horse sledge from the railway station,\nand a gentleman in a fur coat.",
      "It was not his brother.",
      "Oh, if it were\nonly some nice person one could talk to a little!",
      "he thought.",
      "Ah,  cried Levin joyfully, flinging up both his hands.",
      "Here s a\ndelightful visitor!",
      "Ah, how glad I am to see you!",
      "he shouted,\nrecognizing Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I shall find out for certain whether she s married, or when she s\ngoing to be married,  he thought.",
      "And on that delicious spring day he\nfelt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all.",
      "Well, you didn t expect me, eh?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting out\nof the sledge, splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose, on his\ncheek, and on his eyebrows, but radiant with health and good spirits.",
      "I ve come to see you in the first place,  he said, embracing and\nkissing him,  to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the\nforest at Ergushovo third.",
      "Delightful!",
      "What a spring we re having!",
      "How ever did you get along in\na sledge?",
      "In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, \nanswered the driver, who knew him.",
      "Well, I m very, very glad to see you,  said Levin, with a genuine\nsmile of childlike delight.",
      "Levin led his friend to the room set apart for visitors, where Stepan\nArkadyevitch s things were carried also a bag, a gun in a case, a\nsatchel for cigars.",
      "Leaving him there to wash and change his clothes,\nLevin went off to the counting house to speak about the ploughing and\nclover.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, always very anxious for the credit of the\nhouse, met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner.",
      "Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,  he said, and\nwent to the bailiff.",
      "When he came back, Stepan Arkadyevitch, washed and combed, came out of\nhis room with a beaming smile, and they went upstairs together.",
      "Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you!",
      "Now I shall understand\nwhat the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.",
      "No, really, I envy you.",
      "What a house, how nice it all is!",
      "So bright, so\ncheerful!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting that it was not always\nspring and fine weather like that day.",
      "And your nurse is simply\ncharming!",
      "A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable,\nperhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch told him many interesting pieces of news;\nespecially interesting to Levin was the news that his brother, Sergey\nIvanovitch, was intending to pay him a visit in the summer.",
      "Not one word did Stepan Arkadyevitch say in reference to Kitty and the\nShtcherbatskys; he merely gave him greetings from his wife.",
      "Levin was\ngrateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visitor.",
      "As\nalways happened with him during his solitude, a mass of ideas and\nfeelings had been accumulating within him, which he could not\ncommunicate to those about him.",
      "And now he poured out upon Stepan\nArkadyevitch his poetic joy in the spring, and his failures and plans\nfor the land, and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been\nreading, and the idea of his own book, the basis of which really was,\nthough he was unaware of it himself, a criticism of all the old books\non agriculture.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, always charming, understanding\neverything at the slightest reference, was particularly charming on\nthis visit, and Levin noticed in him a special tenderness, as it were,\nand a new tone of respect that flattered him.",
      "The efforts of Agafea Mihalovna and the cook, that the dinner should be\nparticularly good, only ended in the two famished friends attacking the\npreliminary course, eating a great deal of bread and butter, salt goose\nand salted mushrooms, and in Levin s finally ordering the soup to be\nserved without the accompaniment of little pies, with which the cook\nhad particularly meant to impress their visitor.",
      "But though Stepan\nArkadyevitch was accustomed to very different dinners, he thought\neverything excellent: the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter,\nand above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup,\nand the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine everything\nwas superb and delicious.",
      "Splendid, splendid!",
      "he said, lighting a fat cigar after the roast.",
      "I\nfeel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the\nnoise and jolting of a steamer.",
      "And so you maintain that the laborer\nhimself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of\nmethods in agriculture.",
      "Of course, I m an ignorant outsider; but I\nshould fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the\nlaborer too.",
      "Yes, but wait a bit.",
      "I m not talking of political economy, I m talking\nof the science of agriculture.",
      "It ought to be like the natural\nsciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his\neconomic, ethnographical.... \n\nAt that instant Agafea Mihalovna came in with jam.",
      "Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, kissing the tips of\nhis plump fingers,  what salt goose, what herb brandy!...",
      "What do you\nthink, isn t it time to start, Kostya?",
      "he added.",
      "Levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare\ntree-tops of the forest.",
      "Yes, it s time,  he said.",
      "Kouzma, get ready the trap,  and he ran\ndownstairs.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, going down, carefully took the canvas cover off\nhis varnished gun case with his own hands, and opening it, began to get\nready his expensive new-fashioned gun.",
      "Kouzma, who already scented a\nbig tip, never left Stepan Arkadyevitch s side, and put on him both his\nstockings and boots, a task which Stepan Arkadyevitch readily left him.",
      "Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ...",
      "I told him\nto come today, he s to be brought in and to wait for me.... \n\n Why, do you mean to say you re selling the forest to Ryabinin?",
      "Yes.",
      "Do you know him?",
      "To be sure I do.",
      "I have had to do business with him,  positively and\nconclusively.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch laughed.",
      "Positively and conclusively  were the\nmerchant s favorite words.",
      "Yes, it s wonderfully funny the way he talks.",
      "She knows where her\nmaster s going!",
      "he added, patting Laska, who hung about Levin, whining\nand licking his hands, his boots, and his gun.",
      "The trap was already at the steps when they went out.",
      "I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?",
      "No, we d better drive,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting into the\ntrap.",
      "He sat down, tucked the tiger-skin rug round him, and lighted a\ncigar.",
      "How is it you don t smoke?",
      "A cigar is a sort of thing, not\nexactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure.",
      "Come,\nthis is life!",
      "How splendid it is!",
      "This is how I should like to live!",
      "Why, who prevents you?",
      "said Levin, smiling.",
      "No, you re a lucky man!",
      "You ve got everything you like.",
      "You like\nhorses and you have them; dogs you have them; shooting you have it;\nfarming you have it.",
      "Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don t fret for what I\nhaven t,  said Levin, thinking of Kitty.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch comprehended, looked at him, but said nothing.",
      "Levin was grateful to Oblonsky for noticing, with his never-failing\ntact, that he dreaded conversation about the Shtcherbatskys, and so\nsaying nothing about them.",
      "But now Levin was longing to find out what\nwas tormenting him so, yet he had not the courage to begin.",
      "Come, tell me how things are going with you,  said Levin, bethinking\nhimself that it was not nice of him to think only of himself.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s eyes sparkled merrily.",
      "You don t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when one\nhas had one s rations of bread to your mind it s a crime; but I don t\ncount life as life without love,  he said, taking Levin s question his\nown way.",
      "What am I to do?",
      "I m made that way.",
      "And really, one does so\nlittle harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure.... \n\n What!",
      "is there something new, then?",
      "queried Levin.",
      "Yes, my boy, there is!",
      "There, do you see, you know the type of\nOssian s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well, these\nwomen are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are\nterrible.",
      "Woman, don t you know, is such a subject that however much\nyou study it, it s always perfectly new.",
      "Well, then, it would be better not to study it.",
      "No.",
      "Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for\ntruth, not in the finding it.",
      "Levin listened in silence, and in spite of all the efforts he made, he\ncould not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and\nunderstand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nThe place fixed on for the stand-shooting was not far above a stream in\na little aspen copse.",
      "On reaching the copse, Levin got out of the trap\nand led Oblonsky to a corner of a mossy, swampy glade, already quite\nfree from snow.",
      "He went back himself to a double birch tree on the\nother side, and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch, he\ntook off his full overcoat, fastened his belt again, and worked his\narms to see if they were free.",
      "Gray old Laska, who had followed them, sat down warily opposite him and\npricked up her ears.",
      "The sun was setting behind a thick forest, and in\nthe glow of sunset the birch trees, dotted about in the aspen copse,\nstood out clearly with their hanging twigs, and their buds swollen\nalmost to bursting.",
      "From the thickest parts of the copse, where the snow still remained,\ncame the faint sound of narrow winding threads of water running away.",
      "Tiny birds twittered, and now and then fluttered from tree to tree.",
      "In the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last\nyear s leaves, stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of\nthe grass.",
      "Imagine!",
      "One can hear and see the grass growing!",
      "Levin said to\nhimself, noticing a wet, slate-colored aspen leaf moving beside a blade\nof young grass.",
      "He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet\nmossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the\nsea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes\nat the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud.",
      "A hawk flew high over a forest far away with slow sweep of its wings;\nanother flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and\nvanished.",
      "The birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the\nthicket.",
      "An owl hooted not far off, and Laska, starting, stepped\ncautiously a few steps forward, and putting her head on one side, began\nto listen intently.",
      "Beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo.",
      "Twice she\nuttered her usual cuckoo call, and then gave a hoarse, hurried call and\nbroke down.",
      "Imagine!",
      "the cuckoo already!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, coming out\nfrom behind a bush.",
      "Yes, I hear it,  answered Levin, reluctantly breaking the stillness\nwith his voice, which sounded disagreeable to himself.",
      "Now it s\ncoming!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw\nnothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and\nblue smoke of a cigarette.",
      "Tchk!",
      "tchk!",
      "came the snapping sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch cocking\nhis gun.",
      "What s that cry?",
      "asked Oblonsky, drawing Levin s attention to a\nprolonged cry, as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice, in\nplay.",
      "Oh, don t you know it?",
      "That s the hare.",
      "But enough talking!",
      "Listen,\nit s flying!",
      "almost shrieked Levin, cocking his gun.",
      "They heard a shrill whistle in the distance, and in the exact time, so\nwell known to the sportsman, two seconds later another, a third, and\nafter the third whistle the hoarse, guttural cry could be heard.",
      "Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him\nagainst the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of\nthe aspens, he saw the flying bird.",
      "It was flying straight towards him;\nthe guttural cry, like the even tearing of some strong stuff, sounded\nclose to his ear; the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and\nat the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where\nOblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning: the bird dropped\nlike an arrow, and darted upwards again.",
      "Again came the red flash and\nthe sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep\nup in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with\na heavy splash on the slushy ground.",
      "Can I have missed it?",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, who could not see\nfor the smoke.",
      "Here it is!",
      "said Levin, pointing to Laska, who with one ear raised,\nwagging the end of her shaggy tail, came slowly back as though she\nwould prolong the pleasure, and as it were smiling, brought the dead\nbird to her master.",
      "Well, I m glad you were successful,  said Levin,\nwho, at the same time, had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in\nshooting the snipe.",
      "It was a bad shot from the right barrel,  responded Stepan\nArkadyevitch, loading his gun.",
      "Sh... it s flying!",
      "The shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again.",
      "Two\nsnipe, playing and chasing one another, and only whistling, not crying,\nflew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen.",
      "There was the report\nof four shots, and like swallows the snipe turned swift somersaults in\nthe air and vanished from sight.",
      "The stand-shooting was capital.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shot two more birds\nand Levin two, of which one was not found.",
      "It began to get dark.",
      "Venus,\nbright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west\nbehind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights\nof Arcturus.",
      "Over his head Levin made out the stars of the Great Bear\nand lost them again.",
      "The snipe had ceased flying; but Levin resolved to\nstay a little longer, till Venus, which he saw below a branch of birch,\nshould be above it, and the stars of the Great Bear should be perfectly\nplain.",
      "Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear\nwith its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky,\nyet still he waited.",
      "Isn t it time to go home?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "It was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.",
      "Let s stay a little while,  answered Levin.",
      "As you like.",
      "They were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.",
      "Stiva!",
      "said Levin unexpectedly;  how is it you don t tell me whether\nyour sister-in-law s married yet, or when she s going to be?",
      "Levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could\naffect him.",
      "But he had never dreamed of what Stepan Arkadyevitch\nreplied.",
      "She s never thought of being married, and isn t thinking of it; but\nshe s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad.",
      "They re\npositively afraid she may not live.",
      "What!",
      "cried Levin.",
      "Very ill?",
      "What is wrong with her?",
      "How has\nshe...?",
      "While they were saying this, Laska, with ears pricked up, was looking\nupwards at the sky, and reproachfully at them.",
      "They have chosen a time to talk,  she was thinking.",
      "It s on the\nwing....",
      "Here it is, yes, it is.",
      "They ll miss it,  thought Laska.",
      "But at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which, as\nit were, smote on their ears, and both suddenly seized their guns and\ntwo flashes gleamed, and two bangs sounded at the very same instant.",
      "The snipe flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a\nthicket, bending down the delicate shoots.",
      "Splendid!",
      "Together!",
      "cried Levin, and he ran with Laska into the\nthicket to look for the snipe.",
      "Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?",
      "he wondered.",
      "Yes, Kitty s\nill.... Well, it can t be helped; I m very sorry,  he thought.",
      "She s found it!",
      "Isn t she a clever thing?",
      "he said, taking the warm\nbird from Laska s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.",
      "I ve got it, Stiva!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nOn the way home Levin asked all details of Kitty s illness and the\nShtcherbatskys  plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit\nit, he was pleased at what he heard.",
      "He was pleased that there was\nstill hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had\nmade him suffer so much.",
      "But when Stepan Arkadyevitch began to speak of\nthe causes of Kitty s illness, and mentioned Vronsky s name, Levin cut\nhim short.",
      "I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the\ntruth, no interest in them either.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled hardly perceptibly, catching the\ninstantaneous change he knew so well in Levin s face, which had become\nas gloomy as it had been bright a minute before.",
      "Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Yes, it s settled.",
      "The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.",
      "Eight straight away, and the rest in six years.",
      "I ve been bothering\nabout it for ever so long.",
      "No one would give more.",
      "Then you ve as good as given away your forest for nothing,  said Levin\ngloomily.",
      "How do you mean for nothing?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\ngood-humored smile, knowing that nothing would be right in Levin s eyes\nnow.",
      "Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the\nacre,  answered Levin.",
      "Oh, these farmers!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch playfully.",
      "Your tone of\ncontempt for us poor townsfolk!...",
      "But when it comes to business, we do\nit better than anyone.",
      "I assure you I have reckoned it all out,  he\nsaid,  and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that I m\nafraid of this fellow s crying off, in fact.",
      "You know it s not\n timber,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, hoping by this distinction to\nconvince Levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts.",
      "And it\nwon t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he s\ngiving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.",
      "Levin smiled contemptuously.",
      "I know,  he thought,  that fashion not\nonly in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten\nyears in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in\nseason and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it.",
      "_Timber, run to so many yards the acre._  He says those words without\nunderstanding them himself.",
      "I wouldn t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office, \nsaid he,  and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it.",
      "But\nyou re so positive you know all the lore of the forest.",
      "It s difficult.",
      "Have you counted the trees?",
      "How count the trees?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing, still trying\nto draw his friend out of his ill-temper.",
      "Count the sands of the sea,\nnumber the stars.",
      "Some higher power might do it.",
      "Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can.",
      "Not a single merchant ever\nbuys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them\nfor nothing, as you re doing now.",
      "I know your forest.",
      "I go there every\nyear shooting, and your forest s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an\nacre paid down, while he s giving you sixty by installments.",
      "So that in\nfact you re making him a present of thirty thousand.",
      "Come, don t let your imagination run away with you,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch piteously.",
      "Why was it none would give it, then?",
      "Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he s bought\nthem off.",
      "I ve had to do with all of them; I know them.",
      "They re not\nmerchants, you know: they re speculators.",
      "He wouldn t look at a bargain\nthat gave him ten, fifteen per cent.",
      "profit, but holds back to buy a\nrouble s worth for twenty kopecks.",
      "Well, enough of it!",
      "You re out of temper.",
      "Not the least,  said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.",
      "At the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather,\nwith a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar-straps.",
      "In the\ntrap sat the chubby, tightly belted clerk who served Ryabinin as\ncoachman.",
      "Ryabinin himself was already in the house, and met the\nfriends in the hall.",
      "Ryabinin was a tall, thinnish, middle-aged man,\nwith mustache and a projecting clean-shaven chin, and prominent\nmuddy-looking eyes.",
      "He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with\nbuttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over\nthe ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over\nthem.",
      "He rubbed his face with his handkerchief, and wrapping round him\nhis coat, which sat extremely well as it was, he greeted them with a\nsmile, holding out his hand to Stepan Arkadyevitch, as though he wanted\nto catch something.",
      "So here you are,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, giving him his hand.",
      "That s capital.",
      "I did not venture to disregard your excellency s commands, though the\nroad was extremely bad.",
      "I positively walked the whole way, but I am\nhere at my time.",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects ; he turned to\nLevin, trying to seize his hand too.",
      "But Levin, scowling, made as\nthough he did not notice his hand, and took out the snipe.",
      "Your honors\nhave been diverting yourselves with the chase?",
      "What kind of bird may it\nbe, pray?",
      "added Ryabinin, looking contemptuously at the snipe:  a\ngreat delicacy, I suppose.",
      "And he shook his head disapprovingly, as\nthough he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.",
      "Would you like to go into my study?",
      "Levin said in French to Stepan\nArkadyevitch, scowling morosely.",
      "Go into my study; you can talk\nthere.",
      "Quite so, where you please,  said Ryabinin with contemptuous dignity,\nas though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties\nas to how to behave, but that he could never be in any difficulty about\nanything.",
      "On entering the study Ryabinin looked about, as his habit was, as\nthough seeking the holy picture, but when he had found it, he did not\ncross himself.",
      "He scanned the bookcases and bookshelves, and with the\nsame dubious air with which he had regarded the snipe, he smiled\ncontemptuously and shook his head disapprovingly, as though by no means\nwilling to allow that this game were worth the candle.",
      "Well, have you brought the money?",
      "asked Oblonsky.",
      "Sit down.",
      "Oh, don t trouble about the money.",
      "I ve come to see you to talk it\nover.",
      "What is there to talk over?",
      "But do sit down.",
      "I don t mind if I do,  said Ryabinin, sitting down and leaning his\nelbows on the back of his chair in a position of the intensest\ndiscomfort to himself.",
      "You must knock it down a bit, prince.",
      "It would\nbe too bad.",
      "The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing.",
      "As to\npaying the money down, there ll be no hitch there.",
      "Levin, who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard, was\njust going out of the door, but catching the merchant s words, he\nstopped.",
      "Why, you ve got the forest for nothing as it is,  he said.",
      "He came to\nme too late, or I d have fixed the price for him.",
      "Ryabinin got up, and in silence, with a smile, he looked Levin down and\nup.",
      "Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  he said with a\nsmile, turning to Stepan Arkadyevitch;  there s positively no dealing\nwith him.",
      "I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I\noffered too.",
      "Why should I give you my goods for nothing?",
      "I didn t pick it up on the\nground, nor steal it either.",
      "Mercy on us!",
      "nowadays there s no chance at all of stealing.",
      "With the\nopen courts and everything done in style, nowadays there s no question\nof stealing.",
      "We are just talking things over like gentlemen.",
      "His\nexcellency s asking too much for the forest.",
      "I can t make both ends\nmeet over it.",
      "I must ask for a little concession.",
      "But is the thing settled between you or not?",
      "If it s settled, it s\nuseless haggling; but if it s not,  said Levin,  I ll buy the forest.",
      "The smile vanished at once from Ryabinin s face.",
      "A hawklike, greedy,\ncruel expression was left upon it.",
      "With rapid, bony fingers he\nunbuttoned his coat, revealing a shirt, bronze waistcoat buttons, and a\nwatch chain, and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook.",
      "Here you are, the forest is mine,  he said, crossing himself quickly,\nand holding out his hand.",
      "Take the money; it s my forest.",
      "That s\nRyabinin s way of doing business; he doesn t haggle over every\nhalf-penny,  he added, scowling and waving the pocketbook.",
      "I wouldn t be in a hurry if I were you,  said Levin.",
      "Come, really,  said Oblonsky in surprise.",
      "I ve given my word, you\nknow.",
      "Levin went out of the room, slamming the door.",
      "Ryabinin looked towards\nthe door and shook his head with a smile.",
      "It s all youthfulness positively nothing but boyishness.",
      "Why, I m\nbuying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that\nRyabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.",
      "And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives.",
      "In God s name.",
      "If you would kindly sign the title-deed....",
      "Within an hour the merchant, stroking his big overcoat neatly down, and\nhooking up his jacket, with the agreement in his pocket, seated himself\nin his tightly covered trap, and drove homewards.",
      "Ugh, these gentlefolks!",
      "he said to the clerk.",
      "They they re a nice\nlot!",
      "That s so,  responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning\nthe leather apron.",
      "But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail\nIgnatitch?",
      "Well, well.... \n\n\nChapter 17\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes,\nwhich the merchant had paid him for three months in advance.",
      "The\nbusiness of the forest was over, the money in his pocket; their\nshooting had been excellent, and Stepan Arkadyevitch was in the\nhappiest frame of mind, and so he felt specially anxious to dissipate\nthe ill-humor that had come upon Levin.",
      "He wanted to finish the day at\nsupper as pleasantly as it had been begun.",
      "Levin certainly was out of humor, and in spite of all his desire to be\naffectionate and cordial to his charming visitor, he could not control\nhis mood.",
      "The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married had\ngradually begun to work upon him.",
      "Kitty was not married, but ill, and ill from love for a man who had\nslighted her.",
      "This slight, as it were, rebounded upon him.",
      "Vronsky had\nslighted her, and she had slighted him, Levin.",
      "Consequently Vronsky had\nthe right to despise Levin, and therefore he was his enemy.",
      "But all\nthis Levin did not think out.",
      "He vaguely felt that there was something\nin it insulting to him, and he was not angry now at what had disturbed\nhim, but he fell foul of everything that presented itself.",
      "The stupid\nsale of the forest, the fraud practiced upon Oblonsky and concluded in\nhis house, exasperated him.",
      "Well, finished?",
      "he said, meeting Stepan Arkadyevitch upstairs.",
      "Would\nyou like supper?",
      "Well, I wouldn t say no to it.",
      "What an appetite I get in the country!",
      "Wonderful!",
      "Why didn t you offer Ryabinin something?",
      "Oh, damn him!",
      "Still, how you do treat him!",
      "said Oblonsky.",
      "You didn t even shake\nhands with him.",
      "Why not shake hands with him?",
      "Because I don t shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter s a hundred\ntimes better than he is.",
      "What a reactionist you are, really!",
      "What about the amalgamation of\nclasses?",
      "said Oblonsky.",
      "Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens me.",
      "You re a regular reactionist, I see.",
      "Really, I have never considered what I am.",
      "I am Konstantin Levin, and\nnothing else.",
      "And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why?",
      "Because excuse me of\nyour stupid sale.... \n\nStepan Arkadyevitch frowned good-humoredly, like one who feels himself\nteased and attacked for no fault of his own.",
      "Come, enough about it!",
      "he said.",
      "When did anybody ever sell anything\nwithout being told immediately after the sale,  It was worth much\nmore ?",
      "But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... No, I\nsee you ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin.",
      "Maybe I have.",
      "And do you know why?",
      "You ll say again that I m a\nreactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does\nannoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the\nnobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of\nclasses, I m glad to belong.",
      "And their impoverishment is not due to\nextravagance that would be nothing; living in good style that s the\nproper thing for noblemen; it s only the nobles who know how to do it.",
      "Now the peasants about us buy land, and I don t mind that.",
      "The\ngentleman does nothing, while the peasant works and supplants the idle\nman.",
      "That s as it ought to be.",
      "And I m very glad for the peasant.",
      "But I\ndo mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of I don t\nknow what to call it innocence.",
      "Here a Polish speculator bought for\nhalf its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in\nNice.",
      "And there a merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten\nroubles, as security for the loan of one rouble.",
      "Here, for no kind of\nreason, you ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles.",
      "Well, what should I have done?",
      "Counted every tree?",
      "Of course, they must be counted.",
      "You didn t count them, but Ryabinin\ndid.",
      "Ryabinin s children will have means of livelihood and education,\nwhile yours maybe will not!",
      "Well, you must excuse me, but there s something mean in this counting.",
      "We have our business and they have theirs, and they must make their\nprofit.",
      "Anyway, the thing s done, and there s an end of it.",
      "And here\ncome some poached eggs, my favorite dish.",
      "And Agafea Mihalovna will\ngive us that marvelous herb-brandy.... \n\nStepan Arkadyevitch sat down at the table and began joking with Agafea\nMihalovna, assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a\ndinner and such a supper.",
      "Well, you do praise it, anyway,  said Agafea Mihalovna,  but\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will a crust of bread he ll\neat it and walk away.",
      "Though Levin tried to control himself, he was gloomy and silent.",
      "He\nwanted to put one question to Stepan Arkadyevitch, but he could not\nbring himself to the point, and could not find the words or the moment\nin which to put it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had gone down to his room,\nundressed, again washed, and attired in a nightshirt with goffered\nfrills, he had got into bed, but Levin still lingered in his room,\ntalking of various trifling matters, and not daring to ask what he\nwanted to know.",
      "How wonderfully they make this soap,  he said gazing at a piece of\nsoap he was handling, which Agafea Mihalovna had put ready for the\nvisitor but Oblonsky had not used.",
      "Only look; why, it s a work of\nart.",
      "Yes, everything s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays, \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, with a moist and blissful yawn.",
      "The theater,\nfor instance, and the entertainments ... a a a!",
      "he yawned.",
      "The\nelectric light everywhere ... a a a!",
      "Yes, the electric light,  said Levin.",
      "Yes.",
      "Oh, and where s Vronsky\nnow?",
      "he asked suddenly, laying down the soap.",
      "Vronsky?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, checking his yawn;  he s in\nPetersburg.",
      "He left soon after you did, and he s not once been in\nMoscow since.",
      "And do you know, Kostya, I ll tell you the truth,  he\nwent on, leaning his elbow on the table, and propping on his hand his\nhandsome ruddy face, in which his moist, good-natured, sleepy eyes\nshone like stars.",
      "It s your own fault.",
      "You took fright at the sight of\nyour rival.",
      "But, as I told you at the time, I couldn t say which had\nthe better chance.",
      "Why didn t you fight it out?",
      "I told you at the time\nthat....",
      "He yawned inwardly, without opening his mouth.",
      "Does he know, or doesn t he, that I did make an offer?",
      "Levin\nwondered, gazing at him.",
      "Yes, there s something humbugging, diplomatic\nin his face,  and feeling he was blushing, he looked Stepan\nArkadyevitch straight in the face without speaking.",
      "If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but a\nsuperficial attraction,  pursued Oblonsky.",
      "His being such a perfect\naristocrat, don t you know, and his future position in society, had an\ninfluence not with her, but with her mother.",
      "Levin scowled.",
      "The humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart,\nas though it were a fresh wound he had only just received.",
      "But he was\nat home, and the walls of home are a support.",
      "Stay, stay,  he began, interrupting Oblonsky.",
      "You talk of his being\nan aristocrat.",
      "But allow me to ask what it consists in, that\naristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked\ndown upon?",
      "You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don t. A man whose\nfather crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother God\nknows whom she wasn t mixed up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider\nmyself aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past\nto three or four honorable generations of their family, of the highest\ndegree of breeding (talent and intellect, of course that s another\nmatter), and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on\nanyone for anything, like my father and my grandfather.",
      "And I know many\nsuch.",
      "You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while\nyou make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from\nyour lands and I don t know what, while I don t and so I prize what s\ncome to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work.... We are\naristocrats, and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful\nof this world, and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny.",
      "Well, but whom are you attacking?",
      "I agree with you,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, sincerely and genially; though he was aware that in the\nclass of those who could be bought for twopence halfpenny Levin was\nreckoning him too.",
      "Levin s warmth gave him genuine pleasure.",
      "Whom are\nyou attacking?",
      "Though a good deal is not true that you say about\nVronsky, but I won t talk about that.",
      "I tell you straight out, if I\nwere you, I should go back with me to Moscow, and.... \n\n No; I don t know whether you know it or not, but I don t care.",
      "And I\ntell you I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina\nAlexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating\nreminiscence.",
      "What ever for?",
      "What nonsense!",
      "But we won t talk about it.",
      "Please forgive me, if I ve been nasty, \nsaid Levin.",
      "Now that he had opened his heart, he became as he had been\nin the morning.",
      "You re not angry with me, Stiva?",
      "Please don t be\nangry,  he said, and smiling, he took his hand.",
      "Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be.",
      "I m glad we ve spoken\nopenly.",
      "And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually\ngood why not go?",
      "I couldn t sleep the night anyway, but I might go\nstraight from shooting to the station.",
      "Capital.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nAlthough all Vronsky s inner life was absorbed in his passion, his\nexternal life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old\naccustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests.",
      "The\ninterests of his regiment took an important place in Vronsky s life,\nboth because he was fond of the regiment, and because the regiment was\nfond of him.",
      "They were not only fond of Vronsky in his regiment, they\nrespected him too, and were proud of him; proud that this man, with his\nimmense wealth, his brilliant education and abilities, and the path\nopen before him to every kind of success, distinction, and ambition,\nhad disregarded all that, and of all the interests of life had the\ninterests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart.",
      "Vronsky was aware of his comrades  view of him, and in addition to his\nliking for the life, he felt bound to keep up that reputation.",
      "It need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his\ncomrades, nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking\nbouts (though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of\nhimself).",
      "And he shut up any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted\nto allude to his connection.",
      "But in spite of that, his love was known\nto all the town; everyone guessed with more or less confidence at his\nrelations with Madame Karenina.",
      "The majority of the younger men envied\nhim for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted\nposition of Karenin, and the consequent publicity of their connection\nin society.",
      "The greater number of the young women, who envied Anna and had long\nbeen weary of hearing her called _virtuous_, rejoiced at the\nfulfillment of their predictions, and were only waiting for a decisive\nturn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their\nscorn.",
      "They were already making ready their handfuls of mud to fling at\nher when the right moment arrived.",
      "The greater number of the\nmiddle-aged people and certain great personages were displeased at the\nprospect of the impending scandal in society.",
      "Vronsky s mother, on hearing of his connection, was at first pleased at\nit, because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a\nbrilliant young man as a _liaison_ in the highest society; she was\npleased, too, that Madame Karenina, who had so taken her fancy, and had\ntalked so much of her son, was, after all, just like all other pretty\nand well-bred women, at least according to the Countess Vronskaya s\nideas.",
      "But she had heard of late that her son had refused a position\noffered him of great importance to his career, simply in order to\nremain in the regiment, where he could be constantly seeing Madame\nKarenina.",
      "She learned that great personages were displeased with him on\nthis account, and she changed her opinion.",
      "She was vexed, too, that\nfrom all she could learn of this connection it was not that brilliant,\ngraceful, worldly _liaison_ which she would have welcomed, but a sort\nof Wertherish, desperate passion, so she was told, which might well\nlead him into imprudence.",
      "She had not seen him since his abrupt\ndeparture from Moscow, and she sent her elder son to bid him come to\nsee her.",
      "This elder son, too, was displeased with his younger brother.",
      "He did\nnot distinguish what sort of love his might be, big or little,\npassionate or passionless, lasting or passing (he kept a ballet girl\nhimself, though he was the father of a family, so he was lenient in\nthese matters), but he knew that this love affair was viewed with\ndispleasure by those whom it was necessary to please, and therefore he\ndid not approve of his brother s conduct.",
      "Besides the service and society, Vronsky had another great\ninterest horses; he was passionately fond of horses.",
      "That year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers.",
      "Vronsky had put his name down, bought a thoroughbred English mare, and\nin spite of his love affair, he was looking forward to the races with\nintense, though reserved, excitement....",
      "These two passions did not interfere with one another.",
      "On the contrary,\nhe needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love, so as\nto recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated\nhim.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nOn the day of the races at Krasnoe Selo, Vronsky had come earlier than\nusual to eat beefsteak in the common messroom of the regiment.",
      "He had\nno need to be strict with himself, as he had very quickly been brought\ndown to the required light weight; but still he had to avoid gaining\nflesh, and so he eschewed farinaceous and sweet dishes.",
      "He sat with his\ncoat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the\ntable, and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a\nFrench novel that lay open on his plate.",
      "He was only looking at the\nbook to avoid conversation with the officers coming in and out; he was\nthinking.",
      "He was thinking of Anna s promise to see him that day after the races.",
      "But he had not seen her for three days, and as her husband had just\nreturned from abroad, he did not know whether she would be able to meet\nhim today or not, and he did not know how to find out.",
      "He had had his\nlast interview with her at his cousin Betsy s summer villa.",
      "He visited\nthe Karenins  summer villa as rarely as possible.",
      "Now he wanted to go\nthere, and he pondered the question how to do it.",
      "Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she s coming to\nthe races.",
      "Of course, I ll go,  he decided, lifting his head from the\nbook.",
      "And as he vividly pictured the happiness of seeing her, his face\nlighted up.",
      "Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and three\nhorses as quick as they can,  he said to the servant, who handed him\nthe steak on a hot silver dish, and moving the dish up he began eating.",
      "From the billiard room next door came the sound of balls knocking, of\ntalk and laughter.",
      "Two officers appeared at the entrance-door: one, a\nyoung fellow, with a feeble, delicate face, who had lately joined the\nregiment from the Corps of Pages; the other, a plump, elderly officer,\nwith a bracelet on his wrist, and little eyes, lost in fat.",
      "Vronsky glanced at them, frowned, and looking down at his book as\nthough he had not noticed them, he proceeded to eat and read at the\nsame time.",
      "What?",
      "Fortifying yourself for your work?",
      "said the plump officer,\nsitting down beside him.",
      "As you see,  responded Vronsky, knitting his brows, wiping his mouth,\nand not looking at the officer.",
      "So you re not afraid of getting fat?",
      "said the latter, turning a chair\nround for the young officer.",
      "What?",
      "said Vronsky angrily, making a wry face of disgust, and showing\nhis even teeth.",
      "You re not afraid of getting fat?",
      "Waiter, sherry!",
      "said Vronsky, without replying, and moving the book\nto the other side of him, he went on reading.",
      "The plump officer took up the list of wines and turned to the young\nofficer.",
      "You choose what we re to drink,  he said, handing him the card, and\nlooking at him.",
      "Rhine wine, please,  said the young officer, stealing a timid glance\nat Vronsky, and trying to pull his scarcely visible mustache.",
      "Seeing\nthat Vronsky did not turn round, the young officer got up.",
      "Let s go into the billiard room,  he said.",
      "The plump officer rose submissively, and they moved towards the door.",
      "At that moment there walked into the room the tall and well-built\nCaptain Yashvin.",
      "Nodding with an air of lofty contempt to the two\nofficers, he went up to Vronsky.",
      "Ah!",
      "here he is!",
      "he cried, bringing his big hand down heavily on his\nepaulet.",
      "Vronsky looked round angrily, but his face lighted up\nimmediately with his characteristic expression of genial and manly\nserenity.",
      "That s it, Alexey,  said the captain, in his loud baritone.",
      "You must\njust eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass.",
      "Oh, I m not hungry.",
      "There go the inseparables,  Yashvin dropped, glancing sarcastically at\nthe two officers who were at that instant leaving the room.",
      "And he bent\nhis long legs, swathed in tight riding breeches, and sat down in the\nchair, too low for him, so that his knees were cramped up in a sharp\nangle.",
      "Why didn t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday?",
      "Numerova wasn t\nat all bad.",
      "Where were you?",
      "I was late at the Tverskoys ,  said Vronsky.",
      "Ah!",
      "responded Yashvin.",
      "Yashvin, a gambler and a rake, a man not merely without moral\nprinciples, but of immoral principles, Yashvin was Vronsky s greatest\nfriend in the regiment.",
      "Vronsky liked him both for his exceptional\nphysical strength, which he showed for the most part by being able to\ndrink like a fish, and do without sleep without being in the slightest\ndegree affected by it; and for his great strength of character, which\nhe showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers,\ncommanding both fear and respect, and also at cards, when he would play\nfor tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk, always with\nsuch skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the\nEnglish Club.",
      "Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin particularly because\nhe felt Yashvin liked him, not for his name and his money, but for\nhimself.",
      "And of all men he was the only one with whom Vronsky would\nhave liked to speak of his love.",
      "He felt that Yashvin, in spite of his\napparent contempt for every sort of feeling, was the only man who\ncould, so he fancied, comprehend the intense passion which now filled\nhis whole life.",
      "Moreover, he felt certain that Yashvin, as it was, took\nno delight in gossip and scandal, and interpreted his feeling rightly,\nthat is to say, knew and believed that this passion was not a jest, not\na pastime, but something more serious and important.",
      "Vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion, but he was aware that\nhe knew all about it, and that he put the right interpretation on it,\nand he was glad to see that in his eyes.",
      "Ah!",
      "yes,  he said, to the announcement that Vronsky had been at the\nTverskoys ; and his black eyes shining, he plucked at his left\nmustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he had.",
      "Well, and what did you do yesterday?",
      "Win anything?",
      "asked Vronsky.",
      "Eight thousand.",
      "But three don t count; he won t pay up.",
      "Oh, then you can afford to lose over me,  said Vronsky, laughing.",
      "(Yashvin had bet heavily on Vronsky in the races.)",
      "No chance of my losing.",
      "Mahotin s the only one that s risky.",
      "And the conversation passed to forecasts of the coming race, the only\nthing Vronsky could think of just now.",
      "Come along, I ve finished,  said Vronsky, and getting up he went to\nthe door.",
      "Yashvin got up too, stretching his long legs and his long\nback.",
      "It s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink.",
      "I ll come\nalong directly.",
      "Hi, wine!",
      "he shouted, in his rich voice, that always\nrang out so loudly at drill, and set the windows shaking now.",
      "No, all right,  he shouted again immediately after.",
      "You re going\nhome, so I ll go with you.",
      "And he walked out with Vronsky.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nVronsky was staying in a roomy, clean, Finnish hut, divided into two by\na partition.",
      "Petritsky lived with him in camp too.",
      "Petritsky was asleep\nwhen Vronsky and Yashvin came into the hut.",
      "Get up, don t go on sleeping,  said Yashvin, going behind the\npartition and giving Petritsky, who was lying with ruffled hair and\nwith his nose in the pillow, a prod on the shoulder.",
      "Petritsky jumped up suddenly onto his knees and looked round.",
      "Your brother s been here,  he said to Vronsky.",
      "He waked me up, damn\nhim, and said he d look in again.",
      "And pulling up the rug he flung\nhimself back on the pillow.",
      "Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!",
      "he said, getting\nfurious with Yashvin, who was pulling the rug off him.",
      "Shut up!",
      "He\nturned over and opened his eyes.",
      "You d better tell me what to drink;\nsuch a nasty taste in my mouth, that....",
      "Brandy s better than anything,  boomed Yashvin.",
      "Tereshtchenko!",
      "brandy\nfor your master and cucumbers,  he shouted, obviously taking pleasure\nin the sound of his own voice.",
      "Brandy, do you think?",
      "Eh?",
      "queried Petritsky, blinking and rubbing his\neyes.",
      "And you ll drink something?",
      "All right then, we ll have a drink\ntogether!",
      "Vronsky, have a drink?",
      "said Petritsky, getting up and\nwrapping the tiger-skin rug round him.",
      "He went to the door of the\npartition wall, raised his hands, and hummed in French,  There was a\nking in Thule.",
      "Vronsky, will you have a drink?",
      "Go along,  said Vronsky, putting on the coat his valet handed to him.",
      "Where are you off to?",
      "asked Yashvin.",
      "Oh, here are your three\nhorses,  he added, seeing the carriage drive up.",
      "To the stables, and I ve got to see Bryansky, too, about the horses, \nsaid Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky had as a fact promised to call at Bryansky s, some eight miles\nfrom Peterhof, and to bring him some money owing for some horses; and\nhe hoped to have time to get that in too.",
      "But his comrades were at once\naware that he was not only going there.",
      "Petritsky, still humming, winked and made a pout with his lips, as\nthough he would say:  Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.",
      "Mind you re not late!",
      "was Yashvin s only comment; and to change the\nconversation:  How s my roan?",
      "is he doing all right?",
      "he inquired,\nlooking out of the window at the middle one of the three horses, which\nhe had sold Vronsky.",
      "Stop!",
      "cried Petritsky to Vronsky as he was just going out.",
      "Your\nbrother left a letter and a note for you.",
      "Wait a bit; where are they?",
      "Vronsky stopped.",
      "Well, where are they?",
      "Where are they?",
      "That s just the question!",
      "said Petritsky solemnly,\nmoving his forefinger upwards from his nose.",
      "Come, tell me; this is silly!",
      "said Vronsky smiling.",
      "I have not lighted the fire.",
      "Here somewhere about.",
      "Come, enough fooling!",
      "Where is the letter?",
      "No, I ve forgotten really.",
      "Or was it a dream?",
      "Wait a bit, wait a bit!",
      "But what s the use of getting in a rage.",
      "If you d drunk four bottles\nyesterday as I did you d forget where you were lying.",
      "Wait a bit, I ll\nremember!",
      "Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed.",
      "Wait a bit!",
      "This was how I was lying, and this was how he was\nstanding.",
      "Yes yes yes....",
      "Here it is!",
      "and Petritsky pulled a letter\nout from under the mattress, where he had hidden it.",
      "Vronsky took the letter and his brother s note.",
      "It was the letter he\nwas expecting from his mother, reproaching him for not having been to\nsee her and the note was from his brother to say that he must have a\nlittle talk with him.",
      "Vronsky knew that it was all about the same\nthing.",
      "What business is it of theirs!",
      "thought Vronsky, and crumpling\nup the letters he thrust them between the buttons of his coat so as to\nread them carefully on the road.",
      "In the porch of the hut he was met by\ntwo officers; one of his regiment and one of another.",
      "Vronsky s quarters were always a meeting place for all the officers.",
      "Where are you off to?",
      "I must go to Peterhof.",
      "Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?",
      "Yes, but I ve not seen her yet.",
      "They say Mahotin s Gladiator s lame.",
      "Nonsense!",
      "But however are you going to race in this mud?",
      "said the\nother.",
      "Here are my saviors!",
      "cried Petritsky, seeing them come in.",
      "Before him\nstood the orderly with a tray of brandy and salted cucumbers.",
      "Here s\nYashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.",
      "Well, you did give it to us yesterday,  said one of those who had come\nin;  you didn t let us get a wink of sleep all night.",
      "Oh, didn t we make a pretty finish!",
      "said Petritsky.",
      "Volkov climbed\nonto the roof and began telling us how sad he was.",
      "I said:  Let s have\nmusic, the funeral march!",
      "He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over\nthe funeral march.",
      "Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer\nwater and a lot of lemon,  said Yashvin, standing over Petritsky like a\nmother making a child take medicine,  and then a little champagne just\na small bottle.",
      "Come, there s some sense in that.",
      "Stop a bit, Vronsky.",
      "We ll all have\na drink.",
      "No; good-bye all of you.",
      "I m not going to drink today.",
      "Why, are you gaining weight?",
      "All right, then we must have it alone.",
      "Give us the seltzer water and lemon.",
      "Vronsky!",
      "shouted someone when he was already outside.",
      "Well?",
      "You d better get your hair cut, it ll weigh you down, especially at\nthe top.",
      "Vronsky was in fact beginning, prematurely, to get a little bald.",
      "He\nlaughed gaily, showing his even teeth, and pulling his cap over the\nthin place, went out and got into his carriage.",
      "To the stables!",
      "he said, and was just pulling out the letters to read\nthem through, but he thought better of it, and put off reading them so\nas not to distract his attention before looking at the mare.",
      "Later!",
      "Chapter 21\n\nThe temporary stable, a wooden shed, had been put up close to the race\ncourse, and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day.",
      "He\nhad not yet seen her there.",
      "During the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise\nhimself, but had put her in the charge of the trainer, and so now he\npositively did not know in what condition his mare had arrived\nyesterday and was today.",
      "He had scarcely got out of his carriage when\nhis groom, the so-called  stable boy,  recognizing the carriage some\nway off, called the trainer.",
      "A dry-looking Englishman, in high boots\nand a short jacket, clean-shaven, except for a tuft below his chin,\ncame to meet him, walking with the uncouth gait of jockey, turning his\nelbows out and swaying from side to side.",
      "Well, how s Frou-Frou?",
      "Vronsky asked in English.",
      "All right, sir,  the Englishman s voice responded somewhere in the\ninside of his throat.",
      "Better not go in,  he added, touching his hat.",
      "I ve put a muzzle on her, and the mare s fidgety.",
      "Better not go in,\nit ll excite the mare.",
      "No, I m going in.",
      "I want to look at her.",
      "Come along, then,  said the Englishman, frowning, and speaking with\nhis mouth shut, and, with swinging elbows, he went on in front with his\ndisjointed gait.",
      "They went into the little yard in front of the shed.",
      "A stable boy,\nspruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his\nhand, and followed them.",
      "In the shed there were five horses in their\nseparate stalls, and Vronsky knew that his chief rival, Gladiator, a\nvery tall chestnut horse, had been brought there, and must be standing\namong them.",
      "Even more than his mare, Vronsky longed to see Gladiator,\nwhom he had never seen.",
      "But he knew that by the etiquette of the race\ncourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse, but\nimproper even to ask questions about him.",
      "Just as he was passing along\nthe passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the\nleft, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white\nlegs.",
      "He knew that this was Gladiator, but, with the feeling of a man\nturning away from the sight of another man s open letter, he turned\nround and went into Frou-Frou s stall.",
      "The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak...",
      "I never can say the\nname,  said the Englishman, over his shoulder, pointing his big finger\nand dirty nail towards Gladiator s stall.",
      "Mahotin?",
      "Yes, he s my most serious rival,  said Vronsky.",
      "If you were riding him,  said the Englishman,  I d bet on you.",
      "Frou-Frou s more nervous; he s stronger,  said Vronsky, smiling at the\ncompliment to his riding.",
      "In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,  said the\nEnglishman.",
      "Of pluck that is, energy and courage Vronsky did not merely feel that\nhe had enough; what was of far more importance, he was firmly convinced\nthat no one in the world could have more of this  pluck  than he had.",
      "Don t you think I want more thinning down?",
      "Oh, no,  answered the Englishman.",
      "Please, don t speak loud.",
      "The\nmare s fidgety,  he added, nodding towards the horse-box, before which\nthey were standing, and from which came the sound of restless stamping\nin the straw.",
      "He opened the door, and Vronsky went into the horse-box, dimly lighted\nby one little window.",
      "In the horse-box stood a dark bay mare, with a\nmuzzle on, picking at the fresh straw with her hoofs.",
      "Looking round him\nin the twilight of the horse-box, Vronsky unconsciously took in once\nmore in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare.",
      "Frou-Frou was a beast of medium size, not altogether free from\nreproach, from a breeder s point of view.",
      "She was small-boned all over;\nthough her chest was extremely prominent in front, it was narrow.",
      "Her\nhind-quarters were a little drooping, and in her fore-legs, and still\nmore in her hind-legs, there was a noticeable curvature.",
      "The muscles of\nboth hind- and fore-legs were not very thick; but across her shoulders\nthe mare was exceptionally broad, a peculiarity specially striking now\nthat she was lean from training.",
      "The bones of her legs below the knees\nlooked no thicker than a finger from in front, but were extraordinarily\nthick seen from the side.",
      "She looked altogether, except across the\nshoulders, as it were, pinched in at the sides and pressed out in\ndepth.",
      "But she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all\ndefects forgotten: that quality was _blood_, the blood _that tells_, as\nthe English expression has it.",
      "The muscles stood up sharply under the\nnetwork of sinews, covered with the delicate, mobile skin, soft as\nsatin, and they were hard as bone.",
      "Her clean-cut head, with prominent,\nbright, spirited eyes, broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed\nthe red blood in the cartilage within.",
      "About all her figure, and\nespecially her head, there was a certain expression of energy, and, at\nthe same time, of softness.",
      "She was one of those creatures which seem\nonly not to speak because the mechanism of their mouth does not allow\nthem to.",
      "To Vronsky, at any rate, it seemed that she understood all he felt at\nthat moment, looking at her.",
      "Directly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and,\nturning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she\nstarted at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her\nmuzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other.",
      "There, you see how fidgety she is,  said the Englishman.",
      "There, darling!",
      "There!",
      "said Vronsky, going up to the mare and\nspeaking soothingly to her.",
      "But the nearer he came, the more excited she grew.",
      "Only when he stood\nby her head, she was suddenly quieter, while the muscles quivered under\nher soft, delicate coat.",
      "Vronsky patted her strong neck, straightened\nover her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the\nother side, and moved his face near her dilated nostrils, transparent\nas a bat s wing.",
      "She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her\ntense nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her\nstrong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his\nsleeve.",
      "But remembering the muzzle, she shook it and again began\nrestlessly stamping one after the other her shapely legs.",
      "Quiet, darling, quiet!",
      "he said, patting her again over her\nhind-quarters; and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best\npossible condition, he went out of the horse-box.",
      "The mare s excitement had infected Vronsky.",
      "He felt that his heart was\nthrobbing, and that he, too, like the mare, longed to move, to bite; it\nwas both dreadful and delicious.",
      "Well, I rely on you, then,  he said to the Englishman;  half-past six\non the ground.",
      "All right,  said the Englishman.",
      "Oh, where are you going, my lord?",
      "he asked suddenly, using the title  my lord,  which he had scarcely\never used before.",
      "Vronsky in amazement raised his head, and stared, as he knew how to\nstare, not into the Englishman s eyes, but at his forehead, astounded\nat the impertinence of his question.",
      "But realizing that in asking this\nthe Englishman had been looking at him not as an employer, but as a\njockey, he answered:\n\n I ve got to go to Bryansky s; I shall be home within an hour.",
      "How often I m asked that question today!",
      "he said to himself, and he\nblushed, a thing which rarely happened to him.",
      "The Englishman looked\ngravely at him; and, as though he, too, knew where Vronsky was going,\nhe added:\n\n The great thing s to keep quiet before a race,  said he;  don t get\nout of temper or upset about anything.",
      "All right,  answered Vronsky, smiling; and jumping into his carriage,\nhe told the man to drive to Peterhof.",
      "Before he had driven many paces away, the dark clouds that had been\nthreatening rain all day broke, and there was a heavy downpour of rain.",
      "What a pity!",
      "thought Vronsky, putting up the roof of the carriage.",
      "It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.",
      "As he sat in\nsolitude in the closed carriage, he took out his mother s letter and\nhis brother s note, and read them through.",
      "Yes, it was the same thing over and over again.",
      "Everyone, his mother,\nhis brother, everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his\nheart.",
      "This interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a\nfeeling he had rarely known before.",
      "What business is it of theirs?",
      "Why\ndoes everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me?",
      "And why do\nthey worry me so?",
      "Just because they see that this is something they\ncan t understand.",
      "If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they\nwould have left me alone.",
      "They feel that this is something different,\nthat this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than\nlife.",
      "And this is incomprehensible, and that s why it annoys them.",
      "Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do\nnot complain of it,  he said, in the word _we_ linking himself with\nAnna.",
      "No, they must needs teach us how to live.",
      "They haven t an idea\nof what happiness is; they don t know that without our love, for us\nthere is neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all,  he thought.",
      "He was angry with all of them for their interference just because he\nfelt in his soul that they, all these people, were right.",
      "He felt that\nthe love that bound him to Anna was not a momentary impulse, which\nwould pass, as worldly intrigues do pass, leaving no other traces in\nthe life of either but pleasant or unpleasant memories.",
      "He felt all the\ntorture of his own and her position, all the difficulty there was for\nthem, conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world, in\nconcealing their love, in lying and deceiving; and in lying, deceiving,\nfeigning, and continually thinking of others, when the passion that\nunited them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything\nelse but their love.",
      "He vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of\ninevitable necessity for lying and deceit, which were so against his\nnatural bent.",
      "He recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more\nthan once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit.",
      "And\nhe experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him\nsince his secret love for Anna.",
      "This was a feeling of loathing for\nsomething whether for Alexey Alexandrovitch, or for himself, or for the\nwhole world, he could not have said.",
      "But he always drove away this\nstrange feeling.",
      "Now, too, he shook it off and continued the thread of\nhis thoughts.",
      "Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she\ncannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not\nshow it.",
      "Yes, we must put an end to it,  he decided.",
      "And for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was\nessential to put an end to this false position, and the sooner the\nbetter.",
      "Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves somewhere\nalone with our love,  he said to himself.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nThe rain did not last long, and by the time Vronsky arrived, his\nshaft-horse trotting at full speed and dragging the trace-horses\ngalloping through the mud, with their reins hanging loose, the sun had\npeeped out again, the roofs of the summer villas and the old limetrees\nin the gardens on both sides of the principal streets sparkled with wet\nbrilliance, and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs\nrushing streams of water.",
      "He thought no more of the shower spoiling the\nrace course, but was rejoicing now that thanks to the rain he would be\nsure to find her at home and alone, as he knew that Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, who had lately returned from a foreign watering place,\nhad not moved from Petersburg.",
      "Hoping to find her alone, Vronsky alighted, as he always did, to avoid\nattracting attention, before crossing the bridge, and walked to the\nhouse.",
      "He did not go up the steps to the street door, but went into the\ncourt.",
      "Has your master come?",
      "he asked a gardener.",
      "No, sir.",
      "The mistress is at home.",
      "But will you please go to the front\ndoor; there are servants there,  the gardener answered.",
      "They ll open\nthe door.",
      "No, I ll go in from the garden.",
      "And feeling satisfied that she was alone, and wanting to take her by\nsurprise, since he had not promised to be there today, and she would\ncertainly not expect him to come before the races, he walked, holding\nhis sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path, bordered with\nflowers, to the terrace that looked out upon the garden.",
      "Vronsky forgot\nnow all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and\ndifficulties of their position.",
      "He thought of nothing but that he would\nsee her directly, not in imagination, but living, all of her, as she\nwas in reality.",
      "He was just going in, stepping on his whole foot so as\nnot to creak, up the worn steps of the terrace, when he suddenly\nremembered what he always forgot, and what caused the most torturing\nside of his relations with her, her son with his questioning hostile,\nas he fancied eyes.",
      "This boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom.",
      "When he was present, both Vronsky and Anna did not merely avoid\nspeaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone;\nthey did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the\nboy did not understand.",
      "They had made no agreement about this, it had\nsettled itself.",
      "They would have felt it wounding themselves to deceive\nthe child.",
      "In his presence they talked like acquaintances.",
      "But in spite\nof this caution, Vronsky often saw the child s intent, bewildered\nglance fixed upon him, and a strange shyness, uncertainty, at one time\nfriendliness, at another, coldness and reserve, in the boy s manner to\nhim; as though the child felt that between this man and his mother\nthere existed some important bond, the significance of which he could\nnot understand.",
      "As a fact, the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation,\nand he tried painfully, and was not able to make clear to himself what\nfeeling he ought to have for this man.",
      "With a child s keen instinct for\nevery manifestation of feeling, he saw distinctly that his father, his\ngoverness, his nurse, all did not merely dislike Vronsky, but looked on\nhim with horror and aversion, though they never said anything about\nhim, while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "Who is he?",
      "How ought I to love him?",
      "If I don t\nknow, it s my fault; either I m stupid or a naughty boy,  thought the\nchild.",
      "And this was what caused his dubious, inquiring, sometimes\nhostile, expression, and the shyness and uncertainty which Vronsky\nfound so irksome.",
      "This child s presence always and infallibly called up\nin Vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had\nexperienced of late.",
      "This child s presence called up both in Vronsky\nand in Anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the\ncompass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from\nthe right one, but that to arrest his motion is not in his power, that\nevery instant is carrying him further and further away, and that to\nadmit to himself his deviation from the right direction is the same as\nadmitting his certain ruin.",
      "This child, with his innocent outlook upon life, was the compass that\nshowed them the point to which they had departed from what they knew,\nbut did not want to know.",
      "This time Seryozha was not at home, and she was completely alone.",
      "She\nwas sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son, who had\ngone out for his walk and been caught in the rain.",
      "She had sent a\nmanservant and a maid out to look for him.",
      "Dressed in a white gown,\ndeeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind\nsome flowers, and did not hear him.",
      "Bending her curly black head, she\npressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the\nparapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well,\nclasped the pot.",
      "The beauty of her whole figure, her head, her neck,\nher hands, struck Vronsky every time as something new and unexpected.",
      "He stood still, gazing at her in ecstasy.",
      "But, directly he would have\nmade a step to come nearer to her, she was aware of his presence,\npushed away the watering pot, and turned her flushed face towards him.",
      "What s the matter?",
      "You are ill?",
      "he said to her in French, going up to\nher.",
      "He would have run to her, but remembering that there might be\nspectators, he looked round towards the balcony door, and reddened a\nlittle, as he always reddened, feeling that he had to be afraid and be\non his guard.",
      "No, I m quite well,  she said, getting up and pressing his\noutstretched hand tightly.",
      "I did not expect ... thee.",
      "Mercy!",
      "what cold hands!",
      "he said.",
      "You startled me,  she said.",
      "I m alone, and expecting Seryozha; he s\nout for a walk; they ll come in from this side.",
      "But, in spite of her efforts to be calm, her lips were quivering.",
      "Forgive me for coming, but I couldn t pass the day without seeing\nyou,  he went on, speaking French, as he always did to avoid using the\nstiff Russian plural form, so impossibly frigid between them, and the\ndangerously intimate singular.",
      "Forgive you?",
      "I m so glad!",
      "But you re ill or worried,  he went on, not letting go her hands and\nbending over her.",
      "What were you thinking of?",
      "Always the same thing,  she said, with a smile.",
      "She spoke the truth.",
      "If ever at any moment she had been asked what she\nwas thinking of, she could have answered truly: of the same thing, of\nher happiness and her unhappiness.",
      "She was thinking, just when he came\nupon her, of this: why was it, she wondered, that to others, to Betsy\n(she knew of her secret connection with Tushkevitch) it was all easy,\nwhile to her it was such torture?",
      "Today this thought gained special\npoignancy from certain other considerations.",
      "She asked him about the\nraces.",
      "He answered her questions, and, seeing that she was agitated,\ntrying to calm her, he began telling her in the simplest tone the\ndetails of his preparations for the races.",
      "Tell him or not tell him?",
      "she thought, looking into his quiet,\naffectionate eyes.",
      "He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he\nwon t understand as he ought, he won t understand all the gravity of\nthis fact to us.",
      "But you haven t told me what you were thinking of when I came in,  he\nsaid, interrupting his narrative;  please tell me!",
      "She did not answer, and, bending her head a little, she looked\ninquiringly at him from under her brows, her eyes shining under their\nlong lashes.",
      "Her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked.",
      "He\nsaw it, and his face expressed that utter subjection, that slavish\ndevotion, which had done so much to win her.",
      "I see something has happened.",
      "Do you suppose I can be at peace,\nknowing you have a trouble I am not sharing?",
      "Tell me, for God s sake, \nhe repeated imploringly.",
      "Yes, I shan t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the\ngravity of it.",
      "Better not tell; why put him to the proof?",
      "she thought,\nstill staring at him in the same way, and feeling the hand that held\nthe leaf was trembling more and more.",
      "For God s sake!",
      "he repeated, taking her hand.",
      "Shall I tell you?",
      "Yes, yes, yes....",
      "I m with child,  she said, softly and deliberately.",
      "The leaf in her\nhand shook more violently, but she did not take her eyes off him,\nwatching how he would take it.",
      "He turned white, would have said\nsomething, but stopped; he dropped her hand, and his head sank on his\nbreast.",
      "Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it,  she thought, and\ngratefully she pressed his hand.",
      "But she was mistaken in thinking he realized the gravity of the fact as\nshe, a woman, realized it.",
      "On hearing it, he felt come upon him with\ntenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone.",
      "But at\nthe same time, he felt that the turning-point he had been longing for\nhad come now; that it was impossible to go on concealing things from\nher husband, and it was inevitable in one way or another that they\nshould soon put an end to their unnatural position.",
      "But, besides that,\nher emotion physically affected him in the same way.",
      "He looked at her\nwith a look of submissive tenderness, kissed her hand, got up, and, in\nsilence, paced up and down the terrace.",
      "Yes,  he said, going up to her resolutely.",
      "Neither you nor I have\nlooked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now our fate is\nsealed.",
      "It is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he\nspoke to the deception in which we are living.",
      "Put an end?",
      "How put an end, Alexey?",
      "she said softly.",
      "She was calmer now, and her face lighted up with a tender smile.",
      "Leave your husband and make our life one.",
      "It is one as it is,  she answered, scarcely audibly.",
      "Yes, but altogether; altogether.",
      "But how, Alexey, tell me how?",
      "she said in melancholy mockery at the\nhopelessness of her own position.",
      "Is there any way out of such a\nposition?",
      "Am I not the wife of my husband?",
      "There is a way out of every position.",
      "We must take our line,  he said.",
      "Anything s better than the position in which you re living.",
      "Of course,\nI see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son\nand your husband.",
      "Oh, not over my husband,  she said, with a quiet smile.",
      "I don t know\nhim, I don t think of him.",
      "He doesn t exist.",
      "You re not speaking sincerely.",
      "I know you.",
      "You worry about him too.",
      "Oh, he doesn t even know,  she said, and suddenly a hot flush came\nover her face; her cheeks, her brow, her neck crimsoned, and tears of\nshame came into her eyes.",
      "But we won t talk of him.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nVronsky had several times already, though not so resolutely as now,\ntried to bring her to consider their position, and every time he had\nbeen confronted by the same superficiality and triviality with which\nshe met his appeal now.",
      "It was as though there were something in this\nwhich she could not or would not face, as though directly she began to\nspeak of this, she, the real Anna, retreated somehow into herself, and\nanother strange and unaccountable woman came out, whom he did not love,\nand whom he feared, and who was in opposition to him.",
      "But today he was\nresolved to have it out.",
      "Whether he knows or not,  said Vronsky, in his usual quiet and\nresolute tone,  that s nothing to do with us.",
      "We cannot ... you cannot\nstay like this, especially now.",
      "What s to be done, according to you?",
      "she asked with the same\nfrivolous irony.",
      "She who had so feared he would take her condition too\nlightly was now vexed with him for deducing from it the necessity of\ntaking some step.",
      "Tell him everything, and leave him.",
      "Very well, let us suppose I do that,  she said.",
      "Do you know what the\nresult of that would be?",
      "I can tell you it all beforehand,  and a\nwicked light gleamed in her eyes, that had been so soft a minute\nbefore.",
      "Eh, you love another man, and have entered into criminal\nintrigues with him?",
      "(Mimicking her husband, she threw an emphasis on\nthe word  criminal,  as Alexey Alexandrovitch did.)",
      "I warned you of\nthe results in the religious, the civil, and the domestic relation.",
      "You\nhave not listened to me.",
      "Now I cannot let you disgrace my name,   and\nmy son,  she had meant to say, but about her son she could not\njest, disgrace my name, and and more in the same style,  she added.",
      "In general terms, he ll say in his official manner, and with all\ndistinctness and precision, that he cannot let me go, but will take all\nmeasures in his power to prevent scandal.",
      "And he will calmly and\npunctually act in accordance with his words.",
      "That s what will happen.",
      "He s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when he s angry, \nshe added, recalling Alexey Alexandrovitch as she spoke, with all the\npeculiarities of his figure and manner of speaking, and reckoning\nagainst him every defect she could find in him, softening nothing for\nthe great wrong she herself was doing him.",
      "But, Anna,  said Vronsky, in a soft and persuasive voice, trying to\nsoothe her,  we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and then be guided\nby the line he takes.",
      "What, run away?",
      "And why not run away?",
      "I don t see how we can keep on like this.",
      "And\nnot for my sake I see that you suffer.",
      "Yes, run away, and become your mistress,  she said angrily.",
      "Anna,  he said, with reproachful tenderness.",
      "Yes,  she went on,  become your mistress, and complete the ruin\nof.... \n\nAgain she would have said  my son,  but she could not utter that word.",
      "Vronsky could not understand how she, with her strong and truthful\nnature, could endure this state of deceit, and not long to get out of\nit.",
      "But he did not suspect that the chief cause of it was the\nword _son_, which she could not bring herself to pronounce.",
      "When she\nthought of her son, and his future attitude to his mother, who had\nabandoned his father, she felt such terror at what she had done, that\nshe could not face it; but, like a woman, could only try to comfort\nherself with lying assurances that everything would remain as it always\nhad been, and that it was possible to forget the fearful question of\nhow it would be with her son.",
      "I beg you, I entreat you,  she said suddenly, taking his hand, and\nspeaking in quite a different tone, sincere and tender,  never speak to\nme of that!",
      "But, Anna.... \n\n Never.",
      "Leave it to me.",
      "I know all the baseness, all the horror of my\nposition; but it s not so easy to arrange as you think.",
      "And leave it to\nme, and do what I say.",
      "Never speak to me of it.",
      "Do you promise me?...",
      "No, no, promise!...",
      "I promise everything, but I can t be at peace, especially after what\nyou have told me.",
      "I can t be at peace, when you can t be at peace....",
      "I?",
      "she repeated.",
      "Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will pass, if\nyou will never talk about this.",
      "When you talk about it it s only then\nit worries me.",
      "I don t understand,  he said.",
      "I know,  she interrupted him,  how hard it is for your truthful nature\nto lie, and I grieve for you.",
      "I often think that you have ruined your\nwhole life for me.",
      "I was just thinking the very same thing,  he said;  how could you\nsacrifice everything for my sake?",
      "I can t forgive myself that you re\nunhappy!",
      "I unhappy?",
      "she said, coming closer to him, and looking at him with an\necstatic smile of love.",
      "I am like a hungry man who has been given\nfood.",
      "He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not\nunhappy.",
      "I unhappy?",
      "No, this is my unhappiness.... \n\nShe could hear the sound of her son s voice coming towards them, and\nglancing swiftly round the terrace, she got up impulsively.",
      "Her eyes\nglowed with the fire he knew so well; with a rapid movement she raised\nher lovely hands, covered with rings, took his head, looked a long look\ninto his face, and, putting up her face with smiling, parted lips,\nswiftly kissed his mouth and both eyes, and pushed him away.",
      "She would\nhave gone, but he held her back.",
      "When?",
      "he murmured in a whisper, gazing in ecstasy at her.",
      "Tonight, at one o clock,  she whispered, and, with a heavy sigh, she\nwalked with her light, swift step to meet her son.",
      "Seryozha had been caught by the rain in the big garden, and he and his\nnurse had taken shelter in an arbor.",
      "Well, _au revoir_,  she said to Vronsky.",
      "I must soon be getting ready\nfor the races.",
      "Betsy promised to fetch me.",
      "Vronsky, looking at his watch, went away hurriedly.",
      "Chapter 24\n\nWhen Vronsky looked at his watch on the Karenins  balcony, he was so\ngreatly agitated and lost in his thoughts that he saw the figures on\nthe watch s face, but could not take in what time it was.",
      "He came out\non to the highroad and walked, picking his way carefully through the\nmud, to his carriage.",
      "He was so completely absorbed in his feeling for\nAnna, that he did not even think what o clock it was, and whether he\nhad time to go to Bryansky s. He had left him, as often happens, only\nthe external faculty of memory, that points out each step one has to\ntake, one after the other.",
      "He went up to his coachman, who was dozing\non the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick limetree; he\nadmired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses,\nand, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told him to\ndrive to Bryansky s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that\nhe had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch, and realize\nthat it was half-past five, and he was late.",
      "There were several races fixed for that day: the Mounted Guards  race,\nthen the officers  mile-and-a-half race, then the three-mile race, and\nthen the race for which he was entered.",
      "He could still be in time for\nhis race, but if he went to Bryansky s he could only just be in time,\nand he would arrive when the whole of the court would be in their\nplaces.",
      "That would be a pity.",
      "But he had promised Bryansky to come, and\nso he decided to drive on, telling the coachman not to spare the\nhorses.",
      "He reached Bryansky s, spent five minutes there, and galloped back.",
      "This rapid drive calmed him.",
      "All that was painful in his relations with\nAnna, all the feeling of indefiniteness left by their conversation, had\nslipped out of his mind.",
      "He was thinking now with pleasure and\nexcitement of the race, of his being anyhow, in time, and now and then\nthe thought of the blissful interview awaiting him that night flashed\nacross his imagination like a flaming light.",
      "The excitement of the approaching race gained upon him as he drove\nfurther and further into the atmosphere of the races, overtaking\ncarriages driving up from the summer villas or out of Petersburg.",
      "At his quarters no one was left at home; all were at the races, and his\nvalet was looking out for him at the gate.",
      "While he was changing his\nclothes, his valet told him that the second race had begun already,\nthat a lot of gentlemen had been to ask for him, and a boy had twice\nrun up from the stables.",
      "Dressing without hurry (he never hurried\nhimself, and never lost his self-possession), Vronsky drove to the\nsheds.",
      "From the sheds he could see a perfect sea of carriages, and\npeople on foot, soldiers surrounding the race course, and pavilions\nswarming with people.",
      "The second race was apparently going on, for just\nas he went into the sheds he heard a bell ringing.",
      "Going towards the\nstable, he met the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin s Gladiator, being\nled to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked\nlike huge ears edged with blue.",
      "Where s Cord?",
      "he asked the stable-boy.",
      "In the stable, putting on the saddle.",
      "In the open horse-box stood Frou-Frou, saddled ready.",
      "They were just\ngoing to lead her out.",
      "I m not too late?",
      "All right!",
      "All right!",
      "said the Englishman;  don t upset yourself!",
      "Vronsky once more took in in one glance the exquisite lines of his\nfavorite mare; who was quivering all over, and with an effort he tore\nhimself from the sight of her, and went out of the stable.",
      "He went\ntowards the pavilions at the most favorable moment for escaping\nattention.",
      "The mile-and-a-half race was just finishing, and all eyes\nwere fixed on the horse-guard in front and the light hussar behind,\nurging their horses on with a last effort close to the winning post.",
      "From the center and outside of the ring all were crowding to the\nwinning post, and a group of soldiers and officers of the horse-guards\nwere shouting loudly their delight at the expected triumph of their\nofficer and comrade.",
      "Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd\nunnoticed, almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish\nof the race, and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first,\nbending over the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray horse\nthat looked dark with sweat.",
      "The horse, stiffening out its legs, with an effort stopped its rapid\ncourse, and the officer of the horse-guards looked round him like a man\nwaking up from a heavy sleep, and just managed to smile.",
      "A crowd of\nfriends and outsiders pressed round him.",
      "Vronsky intentionally avoided that select crowd of the upper world,\nwhich was moving and talking with discreet freedom before the\npavilions.",
      "He knew that Madame Karenina was there, and Betsy, and his\nbrother s wife, and he purposely did not go near them for fear of\nsomething distracting his attention.",
      "But he was continually met and\nstopped by acquaintances, who told him about the previous races, and\nkept asking him why he was so late.",
      "At the time when the racers had to go to the pavilion to receive the\nprizes, and all attention was directed to that point, Vronsky s elder\nbrother, Alexander, a colonel with heavy fringed epaulets, came up to\nhim.",
      "He was not tall, though as broadly built as Alexey, and handsomer\nand rosier than he; he had a red nose, and an open, drunken-looking\nface.",
      "Did you get my note?",
      "he said.",
      "There s never any finding you.",
      "Alexander Vronsky, in spite of the dissolute life, and in especial the\ndrunken habits, for which he was notorious, was quite one of the court\ncircle.",
      "Now, as he talked to his brother of a matter bound to be exceedingly\ndisagreeable to him, knowing that the eyes of many people might be\nfixed upon him, he kept a smiling countenance, as though he were\njesting with his brother about something of little moment.",
      "I got it, and I really can t make out what _you_ are worrying yourself\nabout,  said Alexey.",
      "I m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that\nyou weren t here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday.",
      "There are matters which only concern those directly interested in\nthem, and the matter you are so worried about is....",
      "Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service....",
      "I beg you not to meddle, and that s all I have to say.",
      "Alexey Vronsky s frowning face turned white, and his prominent lower\njaw quivered, which happened rarely with him.",
      "Being a man of very warm\nheart, he was seldom angry; but when he was angry, and when his chin\nquivered, then, as Alexander Vronsky knew, he was dangerous.",
      "Alexander\nVronsky smiled gaily.",
      "I only wanted to give you Mother s letter.",
      "Answer it, and don t worry\nabout anything just before the race.",
      "_Bonne chance,_  he added, smiling\nand he moved away from him.",
      "But after him another friendly greeting\nbrought Vronsky to a standstill.",
      "So you won t recognize your friends!",
      "How are you, _mon cher?_  said\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as conspicuously brilliant in the midst of all the\nPetersburg brilliance as he was in Moscow, his face rosy, and his\nwhiskers sleek and glossy.",
      "I came up yesterday, and I m delighted that\nI shall see your triumph.",
      "When shall we meet?",
      "Come tomorrow to the messroom,  said Vronsky, and squeezing him by the\nsleeve of his coat, with apologies, he moved away to the center of the\nrace course, where the horses were being led for the great\nsteeplechase.",
      "The horses who had run in the last race were being led home, steaming\nand exhausted, by the stable-boys, and one after another the fresh\nhorses for the coming race made their appearance, for the most part\nEnglish racers, wearing horsecloths, and looking with their drawn-up\nbellies like strange, huge birds.",
      "On the right was led in Frou-Frou,\nlean and beautiful, lifting up her elastic, rather long pasterns, as\nthough moved by springs.",
      "Not far from her they were taking the rug off\nthe lop-eared Gladiator.",
      "The strong, exquisite, perfectly correct lines\nof the stallion, with his superb hind-quarters and excessively short\npasterns almost over his hoofs, attracted Vronsky s attention in spite\nof himself.",
      "He would have gone up to his mare, but he was again\ndetained by an acquaintance.",
      "Oh, there s Karenin!",
      "said the acquaintance with whom he was chatting.",
      "He s looking for his wife, and she s in the middle of the pavilion.",
      "Didn t you see her?",
      "No,  answered Vronsky, and without even glancing round towards the\npavilion where his friend was pointing out Madame Karenina, he went up\nto his mare.",
      "Vronsky had not had time to look at the saddle, about which he had to\ngive some direction, when the competitors were summoned to the pavilion\nto receive their numbers and places in the row at starting.",
      "Seventeen\nofficers, looking serious and severe, many with pale faces, met\ntogether in the pavilion and drew the numbers.",
      "Vronsky drew the number\nseven.",
      "The cry was heard:  Mount!",
      "Feeling that with the others riding in the race, he was the center upon\nwhich all eyes were fastened, Vronsky walked up to his mare in that\nstate of nervous tension in which he usually became deliberate and\ncomposed in his movements.",
      "Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his\nbest clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar,\nwhich propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots.",
      "He was\ncalm and dignified as ever, and was with his own hands holding\nFrou-Frou by both reins, standing straight in front of her.",
      "Frou-Frou\nwas still trembling as though in a fever.",
      "Her eye, full of fire,\nglanced sideways at Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky slipped his finger under the\nsaddle-girth.",
      "The mare glanced aslant at him, drew up her lip, and\ntwitched her ear.",
      "The Englishman puckered up his lips, intending to\nindicate a smile that anyone should verify his saddling.",
      "Get up; you won t feel so excited.",
      "Vronsky looked round for the last time at his rivals.",
      "He knew that he\nwould not see them during the race.",
      "Two were already riding forward to\nthe point from which they were to start.",
      "Galtsin, a friend of Vronsky s\nand one of his more formidable rivals, was moving round a bay horse\nthat would not let him mount.",
      "A little light hussar in tight riding\nbreeches rode off at a gallop, crouched up like a cat on the saddle, in\nimitation of English jockeys.",
      "Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on\nhis thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom\nled her by the bridle.",
      "Vronsky and all his comrades knew Kuzovlev and\nhis peculiarity of  weak nerves  and terrible vanity.",
      "They knew that he\nwas afraid of everything, afraid of riding a spirited horse.",
      "But now,\njust because it was terrible, because people broke their necks, and\nthere was a doctor standing at each obstacle, and an ambulance with a\ncross on it, and a sister of mercy, he had made up his mind to take\npart in the race.",
      "Their eyes met, and Vronsky gave him a friendly and\nencouraging nod.",
      "Only one he did not see, his chief rival, Mahotin on\nGladiator.",
      "Don t be in a hurry,  said Cord to Vronsky,  and remember one thing:\ndon t hold her in at the fences, and don t urge her on; let her go as\nshe likes.",
      "All right, all right,  said Vronsky, taking the reins.",
      "If you can, lead the race; but don t lose heart till the last minute,\neven if you re behind.",
      "Before the mare had time to move, Vronsky stepped with an agile,\nvigorous movement into the steel-toothed stirrup, and lightly and\nfirmly seated himself on the creaking leather of the saddle.",
      "Getting\nhis right foot in the stirrup, he smoothed the double reins, as he\nalways did, between his fingers, and Cord let go.",
      "As though she did not know which foot to put first, Frou-Frou started,\ndragging at the reins with her long neck, and as though she were on\nsprings, shaking her rider from side to side.",
      "Cord quickened his step,\nfollowing him.",
      "The excited mare, trying to shake off her rider first on\none side and then the other, pulled at the reins, and Vronsky tried in\nvain with voice and hand to soothe her.",
      "They were just reaching the dammed-up stream on their way to the\nstarting point.",
      "Several of the riders were in front and several behind,\nwhen suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud\nbehind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged,\nlop-eared Gladiator.",
      "Mahotin smiled, showing his long teeth, but\nVronsky looked angrily at him.",
      "He did not like him, and regarded him\nnow as his most formidable rival.",
      "He was angry with him for galloping\npast and exciting his mare.",
      "Frou-Frou started into a gallop, her left\nfoot forward, made two bounds, and fretting at the tightened reins,\npassed into a jolting trot, bumping her rider up and down.",
      "Cord, too,\nscowled, and followed Vronsky almost at a trot.",
      "Chapter 25\n\nThere were seventeen officers in all riding in this race.",
      "The race\ncourse was a large three-mile ring of the form of an ellipse in front\nof the pavilion.",
      "On this course nine obstacles had been arranged: the\nstream, a big and solid barrier five feet high, just before the\npavilion, a dry ditch, a ditch full of water, a precipitous slope, an\nIrish barricade (one of the most difficult obstacles, consisting of a\nmound fenced with brushwood, beyond which was a ditch out of sight for\nthe horses, so that the horse had to clear both obstacles or might be\nkilled); then two more ditches filled with water, and one dry one; and\nthe end of the race was just facing the pavilion.",
      "But the race began\nnot in the ring, but two hundred yards away from it, and in that part\nof the course was the first obstacle, a dammed-up stream, seven feet in\nbreadth, which the racers could leap or wade through as they preferred.",
      "Three times they were ranged ready to start, but each time some horse\nthrust itself out of line, and they had to begin again.",
      "The umpire who\nwas starting them, Colonel Sestrin, was beginning to lose his temper,\nwhen at last for the fourth time he shouted  Away!",
      "and the racers\nstarted.",
      "Every eye, every opera-glass, was turned on the brightly colored group\nof riders at the moment they were in line to start.",
      "They re off!",
      "They re starting!",
      "was heard on all sides after the hush\nof expectation.",
      "And little groups and solitary figures among the public began running\nfrom place to place to get a better view.",
      "In the very first minute the\nclose group of horsemen drew out, and it could be seen that they were\napproaching the stream in twos and threes and one behind another.",
      "To\nthe spectators it seemed as though they had all started simultaneously,\nbut to the racers there were seconds of difference that had great value\nto them.",
      "Frou-Frou, excited and over-nervous, had lost the first moment, and\nseveral horses had started before her, but before reaching the stream,\nVronsky, who was holding in the mare with all his force as she tugged\nat the bridle, easily overtook three, and there were left in front of\nhim Mahotin s chestnut Gladiator, whose hind-quarters were moving\nlightly and rhythmically up and down exactly in front of Vronsky, and\nin front of all, the dainty mare Diana bearing Kuzovlev more dead than\nalive.",
      "For the first instant Vronsky was not master either of himself or his\nmare.",
      "Up to the first obstacle, the stream, he could not guide the\nmotions of his mare.",
      "Gladiator and Diana came up to it together and almost at the same\ninstant; simultaneously they rose above the stream and flew across to\nthe other side; Frou-Frou darted after them, as if flying; but at the\nvery moment when Vronsky felt himself in the air, he suddenly saw\nalmost under his mare s hoofs Kuzovlev, who was floundering with Diana\non the further side of the stream.",
      "(Kuzovlev had let go the reins as he\ntook the leap, and the mare had sent him flying over her head.)",
      "Those\ndetails Vronsky learned later; at the moment all he saw was that just\nunder him, where Frou-Frou must alight, Diana s legs or head might be\nin the way.",
      "But Frou-Frou drew up her legs and back in the very act of\nleaping, like a falling cat, and, clearing the other mare, alighted\nbeyond her.",
      "O the darling!",
      "thought Vronsky.",
      "After crossing the stream Vronsky had complete control of his mare, and\nbegan holding her in, intending to cross the great barrier behind\nMahotin, and to try to overtake him in the clear ground of about five\nhundred yards that followed it.",
      "The great barrier stood just in front of the imperial pavilion.",
      "The\nTsar and the whole court and crowds of people were all gazing at\nthem at him, and Mahotin a length ahead of him, as they drew near the\n devil,  as the solid barrier was called.",
      "Vronsky was aware of those\neyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the\nears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the\nback and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and\nkeeping always the same distance ahead.",
      "Gladiator rose, with no sound\nof knocking against anything.",
      "With a wave of his short tail he\ndisappeared from Vronsky s sight.",
      "Bravo!",
      "cried a voice.",
      "At the same instant, under Vronsky s eyes, right before him flashed the\npalings of the barrier.",
      "Without the slightest change in her action his\nmare flew over it; the palings vanished, and he heard only a crash\nbehind him.",
      "The mare, excited by Gladiator s keeping ahead, had risen\ntoo soon before the barrier, and grazed it with her hind hoofs.",
      "But her\npace never changed, and Vronsky, feeling a spatter of mud in his face,\nrealized that he was once more the same distance from Gladiator.",
      "Once\nmore he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and\nagain the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away.",
      "At the very moment when Vronsky thought that now was the time to\novertake Mahotin, Frou-Frou herself, understanding his thoughts,\nwithout any incitement on his part, gained ground considerably, and\nbegan getting alongside of Mahotin on the most favorable side, close to\nthe inner cord.",
      "Mahotin would not let her pass that side.",
      "Vronsky had\nhardly formed the thought that he could perhaps pass on the outer side,\nwhen Frou-Frou shifted her pace and began overtaking him on the other\nside.",
      "Frou-Frou s shoulder, beginning by now to be dark with sweat, was\neven with Gladiator s back.",
      "For a few lengths they moved evenly.",
      "But\nbefore the obstacle they were approaching, Vronsky began working at the\nreins, anxious to avoid having to take the outer circle, and swiftly\npassed Mahotin just upon the declivity.",
      "He caught a glimpse of his\nmud-stained face as he flashed by.",
      "He even fancied that he smiled.",
      "Vronsky passed Mahotin, but he was immediately aware of him close upon\nhim, and he never ceased hearing the even-thudding hoofs and the rapid\nand still quite fresh breathing of Gladiator.",
      "The next two obstacles, the water course and the barrier, were easily\ncrossed, but Vronsky began to hear the snorting and thud of Gladiator\ncloser upon him.",
      "He urged on his mare, and to his delight felt that she\neasily quickened her pace, and the thud of Gladiator s hoofs was again\nheard at the same distance away.",
      "Vronsky was at the head of the race, just as he wanted to be and as\nCord had advised, and now he felt sure of being the winner.",
      "His\nexcitement, his delight, and his tenderness for Frou-Frou grew keener\nand keener.",
      "He longed to look round again, but he did not dare do this,\nand tried to be cool and not to urge on his mare so to keep the same\nreserve of force in her as he felt that Gladiator still kept.",
      "There\nremained only one obstacle, the most difficult; if he could cross it\nahead of the others he would come in first.",
      "He was flying towards the\nIrish barricade, Frou-Frou and he both together saw the barricade in\nthe distance, and both the man and the mare had a moment s hesitation.",
      "He saw the uncertainty in the mare s ears and lifted the whip, but at\nthe same time felt that his fears were groundless; the mare knew what\nwas wanted.",
      "She quickened her pace and rose smoothly, just as he had\nfancied she would, and as she left the ground gave herself up to the\nforce of her rush, which carried her far beyond the ditch; and with the\nsame rhythm, without effort, with the same leg forward, Frou-Frou fell\nback into her pace again.",
      "Bravo, Vronsky!",
      "he heard shouts from a knot of men he knew they were\nhis friends in the regiment who were standing at the obstacle.",
      "He could\nnot fail to recognize Yashvin s voice though he did not see him.",
      "O my sweet!",
      "he said inwardly to Frou-Frou, as he listened for what\nwas happening behind.",
      "He s cleared it!",
      "he thought, catching the thud\nof Gladiator s hoofs behind him.",
      "There remained only the last ditch,\nfilled with water and five feet wide.",
      "Vronsky did not even look at it,\nbut anxious to get in a long way first began sawing away at the reins,\nlifting the mare s head and letting it go in time with her paces.",
      "He\nfelt that the mare was at her very last reserve of strength; not her\nneck and shoulders merely were wet, but the sweat was standing in drops\non her mane, her head, her sharp ears, and her breath came in short,\nsharp gasps.",
      "But he knew that she had strength left more than enough\nfor the remaining five hundred yards.",
      "It was only from feeling himself\nnearer the ground and from the peculiar smoothness of his motion that\nVronsky knew how greatly the mare had quickened her pace.",
      "She flew over\nthe ditch as though not noticing it.",
      "She flew over it like a bird; but\nat the same instant Vronsky, to his horror, felt that he had failed to\nkeep up with the mare s pace, that he had, he did not know how, made a\nfearful, unpardonable mistake, in recovering his seat in the saddle.",
      "All at once his position had shifted and he knew that something awful\nhad happened.",
      "He could not yet make out what had happened, when the\nwhite legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin\npassed at a swift gallop.",
      "Vronsky was touching the ground with one\nfoot, and his mare was sinking on that foot.",
      "He just had time to free\nhis leg when she fell on one side, gasping painfully, and, making vain\nefforts to rise with her delicate, soaking neck, she fluttered on the\nground at his feet like a shot bird.",
      "The clumsy movement made by\nVronsky had broken her back.",
      "But that he only knew much later.",
      "At that\nmoment he knew only that Mahotin had flown swiftly by, while he stood\nstaggering alone on the muddy, motionless ground, and Frou-Frou lay\ngasping before him, bending her head back and gazing at him with her\nexquisite eyes.",
      "Still unable to realize what had happened, Vronsky\ntugged at his mare s reins.",
      "Again she struggled all over like a fish,\nand her shoulders setting the saddle heaving, she rose on her front\nlegs but unable to lift her back, she quivered all over and again fell\non her side.",
      "With a face hideous with passion, his lower jaw trembling,\nand his cheeks white, Vronsky kicked her with his heel in the stomach\nand again fell to tugging at the rein.",
      "She did not stir, but thrusting\nher nose into the ground, she simply gazed at her master with her\nspeaking eyes.",
      "A a a!",
      "groaned Vronsky, clutching at his head.",
      "Ah!",
      "what have I\ndone!",
      "he cried.",
      "The race lost!",
      "And my fault!",
      "shameful, unpardonable!",
      "And the poor darling, ruined mare!",
      "Ah!",
      "what have I done!",
      "A crowd of men, a doctor and his assistant, the officers of his\nregiment, ran up to him.",
      "To his misery he felt that he was whole and\nunhurt.",
      "The mare had broken her back, and it was decided to shoot her.",
      "Vronsky could not answer questions, could not speak to anyone.",
      "He\nturned, and without picking up his cap that had fallen off, walked away\nfrom the race course, not knowing where he was going.",
      "He felt utterly\nwretched.",
      "For the first time in his life he knew the bitterest sort of\nmisfortune, misfortune beyond remedy, and caused by his own fault.",
      "Yashvin overtook him with his cap, and led him home, and half an hour\nlater Vronsky had regained his self-possession.",
      "But the memory of that\nrace remained for long in his heart, the cruelest and bitterest memory\nof his life.",
      "Chapter 26\n\nThe external relations of Alexey Alexandrovitch and his wife had\nremained unchanged.",
      "The sole difference lay in the fact that he was\nmore busily occupied than ever.",
      "As in former years, at the beginning of\nthe spring he had gone to a foreign watering-place for the sake of his\nhealth, deranged by the winter s work that every year grew heavier.",
      "And\njust as always he returned in July and at once fell to work as usual\nwith increased energy.",
      "As usual, too, his wife had moved for the summer\nto a villa out of town, while he remained in Petersburg.",
      "From the date\nof their conversation after the party at Princess Tverskaya s he had\nnever spoken again to Anna of his suspicions and his jealousies, and\nthat habitual tone of his bantering mimicry was the most convenient\ntone possible for his present attitude to his wife.",
      "He was a little\ncolder to his wife.",
      "He simply seemed to be slightly displeased with her\nfor that first midnight conversation, which she had repelled.",
      "In his\nattitude to her there was a shade of vexation, but nothing more.",
      "You\nwould not be open with me,  he seemed to say, mentally addressing her;\n so much the worse for you.",
      "Now you may beg as you please, but I won t\nbe open with you.",
      "So much the worse for you!",
      "he said mentally, like a\nman who, after vainly attempting to extinguish a fire, should fly in a\nrage with his vain efforts and say,  Oh, very well then!",
      "you shall burn\nfor this!",
      "This man, so subtle and astute in official life, did not\nrealize all the senselessness of such an attitude to his wife.",
      "He did\nnot realize it, because it was too terrible to him to realize his\nactual position, and he shut down and locked and sealed up in his heart\nthat secret place where lay hid his feelings towards his family, that\nis, his wife and son.",
      "He who had been such a careful father, had from\nthe end of that winter become peculiarly frigid to his son, and adopted\nto him just the same bantering tone he used with his wife.",
      "Aha, young\nman!",
      "was the greeting with which he met him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch asserted and believed that he had never in any\nprevious year had so much official business as that year.",
      "But he was\nnot aware that he sought work for himself that year, that this was one\nof the means for keeping shut that secret place where lay hid his\nfeelings towards his wife and son and his thoughts about them, which\nbecame more terrible the longer they lay there.",
      "If anyone had had the\nright to ask Alexey Alexandrovitch what he thought of his wife s\nbehavior, the mild and peaceable Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made\nno answer, but he would have been greatly angered with any man who\nshould question him on that subject.",
      "For this reason there positively\ncame into Alexey Alexandrovitch s face a look of haughtiness and\nseverity whenever anyone inquired after his wife s health.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch did not want to think at all about his wife s behavior,\nand he actually succeeded in not thinking about it at all.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s permanent summer villa was in Peterhof, and the\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna used as a rule to spend the summer there, close\nto Anna, and constantly seeing her.",
      "That year Countess Lidia Ivanovna\ndeclined to settle in Peterhof, was not once at Anna Arkadyevna s, and\nin conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch hinted at the unsuitability\nof Anna s close intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nsternly cut her short, roundly declaring his wife to be above\nsuspicion, and from that time began to avoid Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "He did not want to see, and did not see, that many people in society\ncast dubious glances on his wife; he did not want to understand, and\ndid not understand, why his wife had so particularly insisted on\nstaying at Tsarskoe, where Betsy was staying, and not far from the camp\nof Vronsky s regiment.",
      "He did not allow himself to think about it, and\nhe did not think about it; but all the same though he never admitted it\nto himself, and had no proofs, not even suspicious evidence, in the\nbottom of his heart he knew beyond all doubt that he was a deceived\nhusband, and he was profoundly miserable about it.",
      "How often during those eight years of happy life with his wife Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had looked at other men s faithless wives and other\ndeceived husbands and asked himself:  How can people descend to that?",
      "how is it they don t put an end to such a hideous position?",
      "But now,\nwhen the misfortune had come upon himself, he was so far from thinking\nof putting an end to the position that he would not recognize it at\nall, would not recognize it just because it was too awful, too\nunnatural.",
      "Since his return from abroad Alexey Alexandrovitch had twice been at\ntheir country villa.",
      "Once he dined there, another time he spent the\nevening there with a party of friends, but he had not once stayed the\nnight there, as it had been his habit to do in previous years.",
      "The day of the races had been a very busy day for Alexey\nAlexandrovitch; but when mentally sketching out the day in the morning,\nhe made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife\nimmediately after dinner, and from there to the races, which all the\nCourt were to witness, and at which he was bound to be present.",
      "He was\ngoing to see his wife, because he had determined to see her once a week\nto keep up appearances.",
      "And besides, on that day, as it was the\nfifteenth, he had to give his wife some money for her expenses,\naccording to their usual arrangement.",
      "With his habitual control over his thoughts, though he thought all this\nabout his wife, he did not let his thoughts stray further in regard to\nher.",
      "That morning was a very full one for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "The evening\nbefore, Countess Lidia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated\ntraveler in China, who was staying in Petersburg, and with it she\nenclosed a note begging him to see the traveler himself, as he was an\nextremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to\nbe useful.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had not had time to read the pamphlet\nthrough in the evening, and finished it in the morning.",
      "Then people\nbegan arriving with petitions, and there came the reports, interviews,\nappointments, dismissals, apportionment of rewards, pensions, grants,\nnotes, the workaday round, as Alexey Alexandrovitch called it, that\nalways took up so much time.",
      "Then there was private business of his\nown, a visit from the doctor and the steward who managed his property.",
      "The steward did not take up much time.",
      "He simply gave Alexey\nAlexandrovitch the money he needed together with a brief statement of\nthe position of his affairs, which was not altogether satisfactory, as\nit had happened that during that year, owing to increased expenses,\nmore had been paid out than usual, and there was a deficit.",
      "But the\ndoctor, a celebrated Petersburg doctor, who was an intimate\nacquaintance of Alexey Alexandrovitch, took up a great deal of time.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had not expected him that day, and was surprised\nat his visit, and still more so when the doctor questioned him very\ncarefully about his health, listened to his breathing, and tapped at\nhis liver.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not know that his friend Lidia\nIvanovna, noticing that he was not as well as usual that year, had\nbegged the doctor to go and examine him.",
      "Do this for my sake,  the\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna had said to him.",
      "I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess,  replied the doctor.",
      "A priceless man!",
      "said the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "The doctor was extremely dissatisfied with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He\nfound the liver considerably enlarged, and the digestive powers\nweakened, while the course of mineral waters had been quite without\neffect.",
      "He prescribed more physical exercise as far as possible, and as\nfar as possible less mental strain, and above all no worry in other\nwords, just what was as much out of Alexey Alexandrovitch s power as\nabstaining from breathing.",
      "Then he withdrew, leaving in Alexey\nAlexandrovitch an unpleasant sense that something was wrong with him,\nand that there was no chance of curing it.",
      "As he was coming away, the doctor chanced to meet on the staircase an\nacquaintance of his, Sludin, who was secretary of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s department.",
      "They had been comrades at the university,\nand though they rarely met, they thought highly of each other and were\nexcellent friends, and so there was no one to whom the doctor would\nhave given his opinion of a patient so freely as to Sludin.",
      "How glad I am you ve been seeing him!",
      "said Sludin.",
      "He s not well,\nand I fancy.... Well, what do you think of him?",
      "I ll tell you,  said the doctor, beckoning over Sludin s head to his\ncoachman to bring the carriage round.",
      "It s just this,  said the\ndoctor, taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling\nit,  if you don t strain the strings, and then try to break them,\nyou ll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost,\nand the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.",
      "And with his close assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his work,\nhe s strained to the utmost; and there s some outside burden weighing\non him, and not a light one,  concluded the doctor, raising his\neyebrows significantly.",
      "Will you be at the races?",
      "he added, as he\nsank into his seat in the carriage.",
      "Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,  the doctor\nresponded vaguely to some reply of Sludin s he had not caught.",
      "Directly after the doctor, who had taken up so much time, came the\ncelebrated traveler, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, by means of the\npamphlet he had only just finished reading and his previous\nacquaintance with the subject, impressed the traveler by the depth of\nhis knowledge of the subject and the breadth and enlightenment of his\nview of it.",
      "At the same time as the traveler there was announced a provincial\nmarshal of nobility on a visit to Petersburg, with whom Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had to have some conversation.",
      "After his departure, he\nhad to finish the daily routine of business with his secretary, and\nthen he still had to drive round to call on a certain great personage\non a matter of grave and serious import.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch only\njust managed to be back by five o clock, his dinner-hour, and after\ndining with his secretary, he invited him to drive with him to his\ncountry villa and to the races.",
      "Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, Alexey Alexandrovitch\nalways tried nowadays to secure the presence of a third person in his\ninterviews with his wife.",
      "Chapter 27\n\nAnna was upstairs, standing before the looking-glass, and, with\nAnnushka s assistance, pinning the last ribbon on her gown when she\nheard carriage wheels crunching the gravel at the entrance.",
      "It s too early for Betsy,  she thought, and glancing out of the window\nshe caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each\nside of it.",
      "How unlucky!",
      "Can he be going to stay the night?",
      "she\nwondered, and the thought of all that might come of such a chance\nstruck her as so awful and terrible that, without dwelling on it for a\nmoment, she went down to meet him with a bright and radiant face; and\nconscious of the presence of that spirit of falsehood and deceit in\nherself that she had come to know of late, she abandoned herself to\nthat spirit and began talking, hardly knowing what she was saying.",
      "Ah, how nice of you!",
      "she said, giving her husband her hand, and\ngreeting Sludin, who was like one of the family, with a smile.",
      "You re\nstaying the night, I hope?",
      "was the first word the spirit of falsehood\nprompted her to utter;  and now we ll go together.",
      "Only it s a pity\nI ve promised Betsy.",
      "She s coming for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch knit his brows at Betsy s name.",
      "Oh, I m not going to separate the inseparables,  he said in his usual\nbantering tone.",
      "I m going with Mihail Vassilievitch.",
      "I m ordered\nexercise by the doctors too.",
      "I ll walk, and fancy myself at the springs\nagain.",
      "There s no hurry,  said Anna.",
      "Would you like tea?",
      "She rang.",
      "Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here.",
      "Well, tell me, how have you been?",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch, you ve not been\nto see me before.",
      "Look how lovely it is out on the terrace,  she said,\nturning first to one and then to the other.",
      "She spoke very simply and naturally, but too much and too fast.",
      "She was\nthe more aware of this from noticing in the inquisitive look Mihail\nVassilievitch turned on her that he was, as it were, keeping watch on\nher.",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch promptly went out on the terrace.",
      "She sat down beside her husband.",
      "You don t look quite well,  she said.",
      "Yes,  he said;  the doctor s been with me today and wasted an hour of\nmy time.",
      "I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him: my\nhealth s so precious, it seems.",
      "No; what did he say?",
      "She questioned him about his health and what he had been doing, and\ntried to persuade him to take a rest and come out to her.",
      "All this she said brightly, rapidly, and with a peculiar brilliance in\nher eyes.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch did not now attach any special\nsignificance to this tone of hers.",
      "He heard only her words and gave\nthem only the direct sense they bore.",
      "And he answered simply, though\njestingly.",
      "There was nothing remarkable in all this conversation, but\nnever after could Anna recall this brief scene without an agonizing\npang of shame.",
      "Seryozha came in preceded by his governess.",
      "If Alexey Alexandrovitch\nhad allowed himself to observe he would have noticed the timid and\nbewildered eyes with which Seryozha glanced first at his father and\nthen at his mother.",
      "But he would not see anything, and he did not see\nit.",
      "Ah, the young man!",
      "He s grown.",
      "Really, he s getting quite a man.",
      "How\nare you, young man?",
      "And he gave his hand to the scared child.",
      "Seryozha had been shy of his\nfather before, and now, ever since Alexey Alexandrovitch had taken to\ncalling him young man, and since that insoluble question had occurred\nto him whether Vronsky were a friend or a foe, he avoided his father.",
      "He looked round towards his mother as though seeking shelter.",
      "It was\nonly with his mother that he was at ease.",
      "Meanwhile, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was holding his son by the shoulder while he was\nspeaking to the governess, and Seryozha was so miserably uncomfortable\nthat Anna saw he was on the point of tears.",
      "Anna, who had flushed a little the instant her son came in, noticing\nthat Seryozha was uncomfortable, got up hurriedly, took Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s hand from her son s shoulder, and kissing the boy, led\nhim out onto the terrace, and quickly came back.",
      "It s time to start, though,  said she, glancing at her watch.",
      "How is\nit Betsy doesn t come?...",
      "Yes,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and getting up, he folded his hands\nand cracked his fingers.",
      "I ve come to bring you some money, too, for\nnightingales, we know, can t live on fairy tales,  he said.",
      "You want\nit, I expect?",
      "No, I don t ... yes, I do,  she said, not looking at him, and\ncrimsoning to the roots of her hair.",
      "But you ll come back here after\nthe races, I suppose?",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And here s the glory of\nPeterhof, Princess Tverskaya,  he added, looking out of the window at\nthe elegant English carriage with the tiny seats placed extremely high.",
      "What elegance!",
      "Charming!",
      "Well, let us be starting too, then.",
      "Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage, but her groom, in\nhigh boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance.",
      "I m going; good-bye!",
      "said Anna, and kissing her son, she went up to\nAlexey Alexandrovitch and held out her hand to him.",
      "It was ever so\nnice of you to come.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch kissed her hand.",
      "Well, _au revoir_, then!",
      "You ll come back for some tea; that s\ndelightful!",
      "she said, and went out, gay and radiant.",
      "But as soon as\nshe no longer saw him, she was aware of the spot on her hand that his\nlips had touched, and she shuddered with repulsion.",
      "Chapter 28\n\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch reached the race-course, Anna was already\nsitting in the pavilion beside Betsy, in that pavilion where all the\nhighest society had gathered.",
      "She caught sight of her husband in the\ndistance.",
      "Two men, her husband and her lover, were the two centers of\nher existence, and unaided by her external senses she was aware of\ntheir nearness.",
      "She was aware of her husband approaching a long way\noff, and she could not help following him in the surging crowd in the\nmidst of which he was moving.",
      "She watched his progress towards the\npavilion, saw him now responding condescendingly to an ingratiating\nbow, now exchanging friendly, nonchalant greetings with his equals, now\nassiduously trying to catch the eye of some great one of this world,\nand taking off his big round hat that squeezed the tips of his ears.",
      "All these ways of his she knew, and all were hateful to her.",
      "Nothing\nbut ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that s all there is in\nhis soul,  she thought;  as for these lofty ideals, love of culture,\nreligion, they are only so many tools for getting on.",
      "From his glances towards the ladies  pavilion (he was staring straight\nat her, but did not distinguish his wife in the sea of muslin, ribbons,\nfeathers, parasols and flowers) she saw that he was looking for her,\nbut she purposely avoided noticing him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "Princess Betsy called to him;  I m sure you\ndon t see your wife: here she is.",
      "He smiled his chilly smile.",
      "There s so much splendor here that one s eyes are dazzled,  he said,\nand he went into the pavilion.",
      "He smiled to his wife as a man should\nsmile on meeting his wife after only just parting from her, and greeted\nthe princess and other acquaintances, giving to each what was due that\nis to say, jesting with the ladies and dealing out friendly greetings\namong the men.",
      "Below, near the pavilion, was standing an\nadjutant-general of whom Alexey Alexandrovitch had a high opinion,\nnoted for his intelligence and culture.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch entered\ninto conversation with him.",
      "There was an interval between the races, and so nothing hindered\nconversation.",
      "The adjutant-general expressed his disapproval of races.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch replied defending them.",
      "Anna heard his high,\nmeasured tones, not losing one word, and every word struck her as\nfalse, and stabbed her ears with pain.",
      "When the three-mile steeplechase was beginning, she bent forward and\ngazed with fixed eyes at Vronsky as he went up to his horse and\nmounted, and at the same time she heard that loathsome, never-ceasing\nvoice of her husband.",
      "She was in an agony of terror for Vronsky, but a\nstill greater agony was the never-ceasing, as it seemed to her, stream\nof her husband s shrill voice with its familiar intonations.",
      "I m a wicked woman, a lost woman,  she thought;  but I don t like\nlying, I can t endure falsehood, while as for _him_ (her husband) it s\nthe breath of his life falsehood.",
      "He knows all about it, he sees it\nall; what does he care if he can talk so calmly?",
      "If he were to kill me,\nif he were to kill Vronsky, I might respect him.",
      "No, all he wants is\nfalsehood and propriety,  Anna said to herself, not considering exactly\nwhat it was she wanted of her husband, and how she would have liked to\nsee him behave.",
      "She did not understand either that Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s peculiar loquacity that day, so exasperating to her,\nwas merely the expression of his inward distress and uneasiness.",
      "As a\nchild that has been hurt skips about, putting all his muscles into\nmovement to drown the pain, in the same way Alexey Alexandrovitch\nneeded mental exercise to drown the thoughts of his wife that in her\npresence and in Vronsky s, and with the continual iteration of his\nname, would force themselves on his attention.",
      "And it was as natural\nfor him to talk well and cleverly, as it is natural for a child to skip\nabout.",
      "He was saying:\n\n Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential\nelement in the race.",
      "If England can point to the most brilliant feats\nof cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she\nhas historically developed this force both in beasts and in men.",
      "Sport\nhas, in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see\nnothing but what is most superficial.",
      "It s not superficial,  said Princess Tverskaya.",
      "One of the officers,\nthey say, has broken two ribs.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled his smile, which uncovered his teeth, but\nrevealed nothing more.",
      "We ll admit, princess, that that s not superficial,  he said,  but\ninternal.",
      "But that s not the point,  and he turned again to the general\nwith whom he was talking seriously;  we mustn t forget that those who\nare taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that\ncareer, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable\nside.",
      "It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer.",
      "Low\nsports, such as prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of\nbarbarity.",
      "But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.",
      "No, I shan t come another time; it s too upsetting,  said Princess\nBetsy.",
      "Isn t it, Anna?",
      "It is upsetting, but one can t tear oneself away,  said another lady.",
      "If I d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.",
      "Anna said nothing, and keeping her opera-glass up, gazed always at the\nsame spot.",
      "At that moment a tall general walked through the pavilion.",
      "Breaking off\nwhat he was saying, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up hurriedly, though with\ndignity, and bowed low to the general.",
      "You re not racing?",
      "the officer asked, chaffing him.",
      "My race is a harder one,  Alexey Alexandrovitch responded\ndeferentially.",
      "And though the answer meant nothing, the general looked as though he\nhad heard a witty remark from a witty man, and fully relished _la\npointe de la sauce_.",
      "There are two aspects,  Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed:  those who take\npart and those who look on; and love for such spectacles is an\nunmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator, I\nadmit, but.... \n\n Princess, bets!",
      "sounded Stepan Arkadyevitch s voice from below,\naddressing Betsy.",
      "Who s your favorite?",
      "Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,  replied Betsy.",
      "I m for Vronsky.",
      "A pair of gloves?",
      "Done!",
      "But it is a pretty sight, isn t it?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused while there was talking about him, but he\nbegan again directly.",
      "I admit that manly sports do not....  he was continuing.",
      "But at that moment the racers started, and all conversation ceased.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch too was silent, and everyone stood up and turned\ntowards the stream.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took no interest in the race,\nand so he did not watch the racers, but fell listlessly to scanning the\nspectators with his weary eyes.",
      "His eyes rested upon Anna.",
      "Her face was white and set.",
      "She was obviously seeing nothing and no one\nbut one man.",
      "Her hand had convulsively clutched her fan, and she held\nher breath.",
      "He looked at her and hastily turned away, scrutinizing\nother faces.",
      "But here s this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it s\nvery natural,  Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself.",
      "He tried not to look\nat her, but unconsciously his eyes were drawn to her.",
      "He examined that\nface again, trying not to read what was so plainly written on it, and\nagainst his own will, with horror read on it what he did not want to\nknow.",
      "The first fall Kuzovlev s, at the stream agitated everyone, but Alexey\nAlexandrovitch saw distinctly on Anna s pale, triumphant face that the\nman she was watching had not fallen.",
      "When, after Mahotin and Vronsky\nhad cleared the worst barrier, the next officer had been thrown\nstraight on his head at it and fatally injured, and a shudder of horror\npassed over the whole public, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that Anna did\nnot even notice it, and had some difficulty in realizing what they were\ntalking of about her.",
      "But more and more often, and with greater\npersistence, he watched her.",
      "Anna, wholly engrossed as she was with the\nrace, became aware of her husband s cold eyes fixed upon her from one\nside.",
      "She glanced round for an instant, looked inquiringly at him, and with a\nslight frown turned away again.",
      "Ah, I don t care!",
      "she seemed to say to him, and she did not once\nglance at him again.",
      "The race was an unlucky one, and of the seventeen officers who rode in\nit more than half were thrown and hurt.",
      "Towards the end of the race\neveryone was in a state of agitation, which was intensified by the fact\nthat the Tsar was displeased.",
      "Chapter 29\n\nEveryone was loudly expressing disapprobation, everyone was repeating a\nphrase someone had uttered The lions and gladiators will be the next\nthing,  and everyone was feeling horrified; so that when Vronsky fell\nto the ground, and Anna moaned aloud, there was nothing very out of the\nway in it.",
      "But afterwards a change came over Anna s face which really\nwas beyond decorum.",
      "She utterly lost her head.",
      "She began fluttering\nlike a caged bird, at one moment would have got up and moved away, at\nthe next turned to Betsy.",
      "Let us go, let us go!",
      "she said.",
      "But Betsy did not hear her.",
      "She was bending down, talking to a general\nwho had come up to her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went up to Anna and courteously offered her his\narm.",
      "Let us go, if you like,  he said in French, but Anna was listening to\nthe general and did not notice her husband.",
      "He s broken his leg too, so they say,  the general was saying.",
      "This\nis beyond everything.",
      "Without answering her husband, Anna lifted her opera-glass and gazed\ntowards the place where Vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and\nthere was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out\nnothing.",
      "She laid down the opera-glass, and would have moved away, but\nat that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the\nTsar.",
      "Anna craned forward, listening.",
      "Stiva!",
      "Stiva!",
      "she cried to her brother.",
      "But her brother did not hear her.",
      "Again she would have moved away.",
      "Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, reaching towards her hand.",
      "She drew back from him with aversion, and without looking in his face\nanswered:\n\n No, no, let me be, I ll stay.",
      "She saw now that from the place of Vronsky s accident an officer was\nrunning across the course towards the pavilion.",
      "Betsy waved her\nhandkerchief to him.",
      "The officer brought the news that the rider was\nnot killed, but the horse had broken its back.",
      "On hearing this Anna sat down hurriedly, and hid her face in her fan.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that she was weeping, and could not control\nher tears, nor even the sobs that were shaking her bosom.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch stood so as to screen her, giving her time to recover\nherself.",
      "For the third time I offer you my arm,  he said to her after a little\ntime, turning to her.",
      "Anna gazed at him and did not know what to say.",
      "Princess Betsy came to her rescue.",
      "No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take her\nhome,  put in Betsy.",
      "Excuse me, princess,  he said, smiling courteously but looking her\nvery firmly in the face,  but I see that Anna s not very well, and I\nwish her to come home with me.",
      "Anna looked about her in a frightened way, got up submissively, and\nlaid her hand on her husband s arm.",
      "I ll send to him and find out, and let you know,  Betsy whispered to\nher.",
      "As they left the pavilion, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as always, talked to\nthose he met, and Anna had, as always, to talk and answer; but she was\nutterly beside herself, and moved hanging on her husband s arm as\nthough in a dream.",
      "Is he killed or not?",
      "Is it true?",
      "Will he come or not?",
      "Shall I see him\ntoday?",
      "she was thinking.",
      "She took her seat in her husband s carriage in silence, and in silence\ndrove out of the crowd of carriages.",
      "In spite of all he had seen,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch still did not allow himself to consider his\nwife s real condition.",
      "He merely saw the outward symptoms.",
      "He saw that\nshe was behaving unbecomingly, and considered it his duty to tell her\nso.",
      "But it was very difficult for him not to say more, to tell her\nnothing but that.",
      "He opened his mouth to tell her she had behaved\nunbecomingly, but he could not help saying something utterly different.",
      "What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel spectacles, \nhe said.",
      "I observe.... \n\n Eh?",
      "I don t understand,  said Anna contemptuously.",
      "He was offended, and at once began to say what he had meant to say.",
      "I am obliged to tell you,  he began.",
      "So now we are to have it out,  she thought, and she felt frightened.",
      "I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming\ntoday,  he said to her in French.",
      "In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?",
      "she said aloud, turning\nher head swiftly and looking him straight in the face, not with the\nbright expression that seemed covering something, but with a look of\ndetermination, under which she concealed with difficulty the dismay she\nwas feeling.",
      "Mind,  he said, pointing to the open window opposite the coachman.",
      "He got up and pulled up the window.",
      "What did you consider unbecoming?",
      "she repeated.",
      "The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the\nriders.",
      "He waited for her to answer, but she was silent, looking straight\nbefore her.",
      "I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even\nmalicious tongues can find nothing to say against you.",
      "There was a time\nwhen I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that\nnow.",
      "Now I speak only of your external attitude.",
      "You have behaved\nimproperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.",
      "She did not hear half of what he was saying; she felt panic-stricken\nbefore him, and was thinking whether it was true that Vronsky was not\nkilled.",
      "Was it of him they were speaking when they said the rider was\nunhurt, but the horse had broken its back?",
      "She merely smiled with a\npretense of irony when he finished, and made no reply, because she had\nnot heard what he said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had begun to speak\nboldly, but as he realized plainly what he was speaking of, the dismay\nshe was feeling infected him too.",
      "He saw the smile, and a strange\nmisapprehension came over him.",
      "She is smiling at my suspicions.",
      "Yes, she will tell me directly what\nshe told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that\nit s absurd.",
      "At that moment, when the revelation of everything was hanging over him,\nthere was nothing he expected so much as that she would answer\nmockingly as before that his suspicions were absurd and utterly\ngroundless.",
      "So terrible to him was what he knew that now he was ready\nto believe anything.",
      "But the expression of her face, scared and gloomy,\ndid not now promise even deception.",
      "Possibly I was mistaken,  said he.",
      "If so, I beg your pardon.",
      "No, you were not mistaken,  she said deliberately, looking desperately\ninto his cold face.",
      "You were not mistaken.",
      "I was, and I could not help\nbeing in despair.",
      "I hear you, but I am thinking of him.",
      "I love him, I\nam his mistress; I can t bear you; I m afraid of you, and I hate\nyou.... You can do what you like to me.",
      "And dropping back into the corner of the carriage, she broke into sobs,\nhiding her face in her hands.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not stir, and\nkept looking straight before him.",
      "But his whole face suddenly bore the\nsolemn rigidity of the dead, and his expression did not change during\nthe whole time of the drive home.",
      "On reaching the house he turned his\nhead to her, still with the same expression.",
      "Very well!",
      "But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of\npropriety till such time his voice shook as I may take measures to\nsecure my honor and communicate them to you.",
      "He got out first and helped her to get out.",
      "Before the servants he\npressed her hand, took his seat in the carriage, and drove back to\nPetersburg.",
      "Immediately afterwards a footman came from Princess Betsy\nand brought Anna a note.",
      "I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite\nwell and unhurt, but in despair.",
      "So _he_ will be here,  she thought.",
      "What a good thing I told him\nall!",
      "She glanced at her watch.",
      "She had still three hours to wait, and the\nmemories of their last meeting set her blood in flame.",
      "My God, how light it is!",
      "It s dreadful, but I do love to see his face,\nand I do love this fantastic light.... My husband!",
      "Oh!",
      "yes.... Well,\nthank God!",
      "everything s over with him.",
      "Chapter 30\n\nIn the little German watering-place to which the Shtcherbatskys had\nbetaken themselves, as in all places indeed where people are gathered\ntogether, the usual process, as it were, of the crystallization of\nsociety went on, assigning to each member of that society a definite\nand unalterable place.",
      "Just as the particle of water in frost,\ndefinitely and unalterably, takes the special form of the crystal of\nsnow, so each new person that arrived at the springs was at once placed\nin his special place.",
      "_F rst_ Shtcherbatsky, _sammt Gemahlin und Tochter_, by the apartments\nthey took, and from their name and from the friends they made, were\nimmediately crystallized into a definite place marked out for them.",
      "There was visiting the watering-place that year a real German F rstin,\nin consequence of which the crystallizing process went on more\nvigorously than ever.",
      "Princess Shtcherbatskaya wished, above\neverything, to present her daughter to this German princess, and the\nday after their arrival she duly performed this rite.",
      "Kitty made a low\nand graceful curtsey in the _very simple_, that is to say, very elegant\nfrock that had been ordered her from Paris.",
      "The German princess said,\n I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,  and\nfor the Shtcherbatskys certain definite lines of existence were at once\nlaid down from which there was no departing.",
      "The Shtcherbatskys made\nthe acquaintance too of the family of an English Lady Somebody, and of\na German countess and her son, wounded in the last war, and of a\nlearned Swede, and of M. Canut and his sister.",
      "But yet inevitably the\nShtcherbatskys were thrown most into the society of a Moscow lady,\nMarya Yevgenyevna Rtishtcheva and her daughter, whom Kitty disliked,\nbecause she had fallen ill, like herself, over a love affair, and a\nMoscow colonel, whom Kitty had known from childhood, and always seen in\nuniform and epaulets, and who now, with his little eyes and his open\nneck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious,\nbecause there was no getting rid of him.",
      "When all this was so firmly\nestablished, Kitty began to be very much bored, especially as the\nprince went away to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother.",
      "She took no interest in the people she knew, feeling that nothing fresh\nwould come of them.",
      "Her chief mental interest in the watering-place\nconsisted in watching and making theories about the people she did not\nknow.",
      "It was characteristic of Kitty that she always imagined\neverything in people in the most favorable light possible, especially\nso in those she did not know.",
      "And now as she made surmises as to who\npeople were, what were their relations to one another, and what they\nwere like, Kitty endowed them with the most marvelous and noble\ncharacters, and found confirmation of her idea in her observations.",
      "Of these people the one that attracted her most was a Russian girl who\nhad come to the watering-place with an invalid Russian lady, Madame\nStahl, as everyone called her.",
      "Madame Stahl belonged to the highest\nsociety, but she was so ill that she could not walk, and only on\nexceptionally fine days made her appearance at the springs in an\ninvalid carriage.",
      "But it was not so much from ill-health as from\npride so Princess Shtcherbatskaya interpreted it that Madame Stahl had\nnot made the acquaintance of anyone among the Russians there.",
      "The\nRussian girl looked after Madame Stahl, and besides that, she was, as\nKitty observed, on friendly terms with all the invalids who were\nseriously ill, and there were many of them at the springs, and looked\nafter them in the most natural way.",
      "This Russian girl was not, as Kitty\ngathered, related to Madame Stahl, nor was she a paid attendant.",
      "Madame\nStahl called her Varenka, and other people called her  Mademoiselle\nVarenka.",
      "Apart from the interest Kitty took in this girl s relations\nwith Madame Stahl and with other unknown persons, Kitty, as often\nhappened, felt an inexplicable attraction to Mademoiselle Varenka, and\nwas aware when their eyes met that she too liked her.",
      "Of Mademoiselle Varenka one would not say that she had passed her first\nyouth, but she was, as it were, a creature without youth; she might\nhave been taken for nineteen or for thirty.",
      "If her features were\ncriticized separately, she was handsome rather than plain, in spite of\nthe sickly hue of her face.",
      "She would have been a good figure, too, if\nit had not been for her extreme thinness and the size of her head,\nwhich was too large for her medium height.",
      "But she was not likely to be\nattractive to men.",
      "She was like a fine flower, already past its bloom\nand without fragrance, though the petals were still unwithered.",
      "Moreover, she would have been unattractive to men also from the lack of\njust what Kitty had too much of of the suppressed fire of vitality, and\nthe consciousness of her own attractiveness.",
      "She always seemed absorbed in work about which there could be no doubt,\nand so it seemed she could not take interest in anything outside it.",
      "It\nwas just this contrast with her own position that was for Kitty the\ngreat attraction of Mademoiselle Varenka.",
      "Kitty felt that in her, in\nher manner of life, she would find an example of what she was now so\npainfully seeking: interest in life, a dignity in life apart from the\nworldly relations of girls with men, which so revolted Kitty, and\nappeared to her now as a shameful hawking about of goods in search of a\npurchaser.",
      "The more attentively Kitty watched her unknown friend, the\nmore convinced she was this girl was the perfect creature she fancied\nher, and the more eagerly she wished to make her acquaintance.",
      "The two girls used to meet several times a day, and every time they\nmet, Kitty s eyes said:  Who are you?",
      "What are you?",
      "Are you really the\nexquisite creature I imagine you to be?",
      "But for goodness  sake don t\nsuppose,  her eyes added,  that I would force my acquaintance on you, I\nsimply admire you and like you.",
      "I like you too, and you re very, very\nsweet.",
      "And I should like you better still, if I had time,  answered the\neyes of the unknown girl.",
      "Kitty saw indeed, that she was always busy.",
      "Either she was taking the children of a Russian family home from the\nsprings, or fetching a shawl for a sick lady, and wrapping her up in\nit, or trying to interest an irritable invalid, or selecting and buying\ncakes for tea for someone.",
      "Soon after the arrival of the Shtcherbatskys there appeared in the\nmorning crowd at the springs two persons who attracted universal and\nunfavorable attention.",
      "These were a tall man with a stooping figure,\nand huge hands, in an old coat too short for him, with black, simple,\nand yet terrible eyes, and a pockmarked, kind-looking woman, very badly\nand tastelessly dressed.",
      "Recognizing these persons as Russians, Kitty\nhad already in her imagination begun constructing a delightful and\ntouching romance about them.",
      "But the princess, having ascertained from\nthe visitors  list that this was Nikolay Levin and Marya Nikolaevna,\nexplained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her fancies\nabout these two people vanished.",
      "Not so much from what her mother told\nher, as from the fact that it was Konstantin s brother, this pair\nsuddenly seemed to Kitty intensely unpleasant.",
      "This Levin, with his\ncontinual twitching of his head, aroused in her now an irrepressible\nfeeling of disgust.",
      "It seemed to her that his big, terrible eyes, which persistently\npursued her, expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried\nto avoid meeting him.",
      "Chapter 31\n\nIt was a wet day; it had been raining all the morning, and the\ninvalids, with their parasols, had flocked into the arcades.",
      "Kitty was walking there with her mother and the Moscow colonel, smart\nand jaunty in his European coat, bought ready-made at Frankfort.",
      "They\nwere walking on one side of the arcade, trying to avoid Levin, who was\nwalking on the other side.",
      "Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat\nwith a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the\narcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they\nexchanged friendly glances.",
      "Mamma, couldn t I speak to her?",
      "said Kitty, watching her unknown\nfriend, and noticing that she was going up to the spring, and that they\nmight come there together.",
      "Oh, if you want to so much, I ll find out about her first and make her\nacquaintance myself,  answered her mother.",
      "What do you see in her out\nof the way?",
      "A companion, she must be.",
      "If you like, I ll make\nacquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-s ur_,  added\nthe princess, lifting her head haughtily.",
      "Kitty knew that the princess was offended that Madame Stahl had seemed\nto avoid making her acquaintance.",
      "Kitty did not insist.",
      "How wonderfully sweet she is!",
      "she said, gazing at Varenka just as she\nhanded a glass to the Frenchwoman.",
      "Look how natural and sweet it all\nis.",
      "It s so funny to see your _engouements_,  said the princess.",
      "No, we d\nbetter go back,  she added, noticing Levin coming towards them with his\ncompanion and a German doctor, to whom he was talking very noisily and\nangrily.",
      "They turned to go back, when suddenly they heard, not noisy talk, but\nshouting.",
      "Levin, stopping short, was shouting at the doctor, and the\ndoctor, too, was excited.",
      "A crowd gathered about them.",
      "The princess and\nKitty beat a hasty retreat, while the colonel joined the crowd to find\nout what was the matter.",
      "A few minutes later the colonel overtook them.",
      "What was it?",
      "inquired the princess.",
      "Scandalous and disgraceful!",
      "answered the colonel.",
      "The one thing to\nbe dreaded is meeting Russians abroad.",
      "That tall gentleman was abusing\nthe doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn t\ntreating him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him.",
      "It s simply a scandal!",
      "Oh, how unpleasant!",
      "said the princess.",
      "Well, and how did it end?",
      "Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...\nintervened.",
      "A Russian lady, I think she is,  said the colonel.",
      "Mademoiselle Varenka?",
      "asked Kitty.",
      "Yes, yes.",
      "She came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by\nthe arm and led him away.",
      "There, mamma,  said Kitty;  you wonder that I m enthusiastic about\nher.",
      "The next day, as she watched her unknown friend, Kitty noticed that\nMademoiselle Varenka was already on the same terms with Levin and his\ncompanion as with her other _prot g s_.",
      "She went up to them, entered\ninto conversation with them, and served as interpreter for the woman,\nwho could not speak any foreign language.",
      "Kitty began to entreat her mother still more urgently to let her make\nfriends with Varenka.",
      "And, disagreeable as it was to the princess to\nseem to take the first step in wishing to make the acquaintance of\nMadame Stahl, who thought fit to give herself airs, she made inquiries\nabout Varenka, and, having ascertained particulars about her tending to\nprove that there could be no harm though little good in the\nacquaintance, she herself approached Varenka and made acquaintance with\nher.",
      "Choosing a time when her daughter had gone to the spring, while Varenka\nhad stopped outside the baker s, the princess went up to her.",
      "Allow me to make your acquaintance,  she said, with her dignified\nsmile.",
      "My daughter has lost her heart to you,  she said.",
      "Possibly you\ndo not know me.",
      "I am.... \n\n That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess,  Varenka answered\nhurriedly.",
      "What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!",
      "said the\nprincess.",
      "Varenka flushed a little.",
      "I don t remember.",
      "I don t think I did\nanything,  she said.",
      "Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.",
      "Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he s very\nill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor.",
      "I m used to looking after\nsuch invalids.",
      "Yes, I ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt I think Madame\nStahl: I used to know her _belle-s ur_.",
      "No, she s not my aunt.",
      "I call her mamma, but I am not related to her;\nI was brought up by her,  answered Varenka, flushing a little again.",
      "This was so simply said, and so sweet was the truthful and candid\nexpression of her face, that the princess saw why Kitty had taken such\na fancy to Varenka.",
      "Well, and what s this Levin going to do?",
      "asked the princess.",
      "He s going away,  answered Varenka.",
      "At that instant Kitty came up from the spring beaming with delight that\nher mother had become acquainted with her unknown friend.",
      "Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with\nMademoiselle.... \n\n Varenka,  Varenka put in smiling,  that s what everyone calls me.",
      "Kitty blushed with pleasure, and slowly, without speaking, pressed her\nnew friend s hand, which did not respond to her pressure, but lay\nmotionless in her hand.",
      "The hand did not respond to her pressure, but\nthe face of Mademoiselle Varenka glowed with a soft, glad, though\nrather mournful smile, that showed large but handsome teeth.",
      "I have long wished for this too,  she said.",
      "But you are so busy.",
      "Oh, no, I m not at all busy,  answered Varenka, but at that moment she\nhad to leave her new friends because two little Russian girls, children\nof an invalid, ran up to her.",
      "Varenka, mamma s calling!",
      "they cried.",
      "And Varenka went after them.",
      "Chapter 32\n\nThe particulars which the princess had learned in regard to Varenka s\npast and her relations with Madame Stahl were as follows:\n\nMadame Stahl, of whom some people said that she had worried her husband\nout of his life, while others said it was he who had made her wretched\nby his immoral behavior, had always been a woman of weak health and\nenthusiastic temperament.",
      "When, after her separation from her husband,\nshe gave birth to her only child, the child had died almost\nimmediately, and the family of Madame Stahl, knowing her sensibility,\nand fearing the news would kill her, had substituted another child, a\nbaby born the same night and in the same house in Petersburg, the\ndaughter of the chief cook of the Imperial Household.",
      "This was Varenka.",
      "Madame Stahl learned later on that Varenka was not her own child, but\nshe went on bringing her up, especially as very soon afterwards Varenka\nhad not a relation of her own living.",
      "Madame Stahl had now been living\nmore than ten years continuously abroad, in the south, never leaving\nher couch.",
      "And some people said that Madame Stahl had made her social\nposition as a philanthropic, highly religious woman; other people said\nshe really was at heart the highly ethical being, living for nothing\nbut the good of her fellow creatures, which she represented herself to\nbe.",
      "No one knew what her faith was Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox.",
      "But one fact was indubitable she was in amicable relations with the\nhighest dignitaries of all the churches and sects.",
      "Varenka lived with her all the while abroad, and everyone who knew\nMadame Stahl knew and liked Mademoiselle Varenka, as everyone called\nher.",
      "Having learned all these facts, the princess found nothing to object to\nin her daughter s intimacy with Varenka, more especially as Varenka s\nbreeding and education were of the best she spoke French and English\nextremely well and what was of the most weight, brought a message from\nMadame Stahl expressing her regret that she was prevented by her ill\nhealth from making the acquaintance of the princess.",
      "After getting to know Varenka, Kitty became more and more fascinated by\nher friend, and every day she discovered new virtues in her.",
      "The princess, hearing that Varenka had a good voice, asked her to come\nand sing to them in the evening.",
      "Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it s true, but you\nwill give us so much pleasure,  said the princess with her affected\nsmile, which Kitty disliked particularly just then, because she noticed\nthat Varenka had no inclination to sing.",
      "Varenka came, however, in the\nevening and brought a roll of music with her.",
      "The princess had invited\nMarya Yevgenyevna and her daughter and the colonel.",
      "Varenka seemed quite unaffected by there being persons present she did\nnot know, and she went directly to the piano.",
      "She could not accompany\nherself, but she could sing music at sight very well.",
      "Kitty, who played\nwell, accompanied her.",
      "You have an extraordinary talent,  the princess said to her after\nVarenka had sung the first song extremely well.",
      "Marya Yevgenyevna and her daughter expressed their thanks and\nadmiration.",
      "Look,  said the colonel, looking out of the window,  what an audience\nhas collected to listen to you.",
      "There actually was quite a\nconsiderable crowd under the windows.",
      "I am very glad it gives you pleasure,  Varenka answered simply.",
      "Kitty looked with pride at her friend.",
      "She was enchanted by her talent,\nand her voice, and her face, but most of all by her manner, by the way\nVarenka obviously thought nothing of her singing and was quite unmoved\nby their praises.",
      "She seemed only to be asking:  Am I to sing again, or\nis that enough?",
      "If it had been I,  thought Kitty,  how proud I should have been!",
      "How\ndelighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows!",
      "But\nshe s utterly unmoved by it.",
      "Her only motive is to avoid refusing and\nto please mamma.",
      "What is there in her?",
      "What is it gives her the power\nto look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything?",
      "How\nI should like to know it and to learn it of her!",
      "thought Kitty, gazing\ninto her serene face.",
      "The princess asked Varenka to sing again, and\nVarenka sang another song, also smoothly, distinctly, and well,\nstanding erect at the piano and beating time on it with her thin,\ndark-skinned hand.",
      "The next song in the book was an Italian one.",
      "Kitty played the opening\nbars, and looked round at Varenka.",
      "Let s skip that,  said Varenka, flushing a little.",
      "Kitty let her eyes\nrest on Varenka s face, with a look of dismay and inquiry.",
      "Very well, the next one,  she said hurriedly, turning over the pages,\nand at once feeling that there was something connected with the song.",
      "No,  answered Varenka with a smile, laying her hand on the music,  no,\nlet s have that one.",
      "And she sang it just as quietly, as coolly, and\nas well as the others.",
      "When she had finished, they all thanked her again, and went off to tea.",
      "Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden that adjoined the\nhouse.",
      "Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that\nsong?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "Don t tell me,  she added hastily,  only say if I m\nright.",
      "No, why not?",
      "I ll tell you simply,  said Varenka, and, without waiting\nfor a reply, she went on:  Yes, it brings up memories, once painful\nones.",
      "I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.",
      "Kitty with big, wide-open eyes gazed silently, sympathetically at\nVarenka.",
      "I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,\nand he married another girl.",
      "He s living now not far from us, and I see\nhim sometimes.",
      "You didn t think I had a love story too,  she said, and\nthere was a faint gleam in her handsome face of that fire which Kitty\nfelt must once have glowed all over her.",
      "I didn t think so?",
      "Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone\nelse after knowing you.",
      "Only I can t understand how he could, to please\nhis mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.",
      "Oh, no, he s a very good man, and I m not unhappy; quite the contrary,\nI m very happy.",
      "Well, so we shan t be singing any more now,  she added,\nturning towards the house.",
      "How good you are!",
      "how good you are!",
      "cried Kitty, and stopping her,\nshe kissed her.",
      "If I could only be even a little like you!",
      "Why should you be like anyone?",
      "You re nice as you are,  said Varenka,\nsmiling her gentle, weary smile.",
      "No, I m not nice at all.",
      "Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let s sit\ndown,  said Kitty, making her sit down again beside her.",
      "Tell me,\nisn t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that\nhe hasn t cared for it?...",
      "But he didn t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a\ndutiful son....",
      "Yes, but if it hadn t been on account of his mother, if it had been\nhis own doing?...",
      "said Kitty, feeling she was giving away her secret,\nand that her face, burning with the flush of shame, had betrayed her\nalready.",
      "In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted\nhim,  answered Varenka, evidently realizing that they were now talking\nnot of her, but of Kitty.",
      "But the humiliation,  said Kitty,  the humiliation one can never\nforget, can never forget,  she said, remembering her look at the last\nball during the pause in the music.",
      "Where is the humiliation?",
      "Why, you did nothing wrong?",
      "Worse than wrong shameful.",
      "Varenka shook her head and laid her hand on Kitty s hand.",
      "Why, what is there shameful?",
      "she said.",
      "You didn t tell a man, who\ndidn t care for you, that you loved him, did you?",
      "Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it.",
      "No, no, there are\nlooks, there are ways; I can t forget it, if I live a hundred years.",
      "Why so?",
      "I don t understand.",
      "The whole point is whether you love him\nnow or not,  said Varenka, who called everything by its name.",
      "I hate him; I can t forgive myself.",
      "Why, what for?",
      "The shame, the humiliation!",
      "Oh!",
      "if everyone were as sensitive as you are!",
      "said Varenka.",
      "There\nisn t a girl who hasn t been through the same.",
      "And it s all so\nunimportant.",
      "Why, what is important?",
      "said Kitty, looking into her face with\ninquisitive wonder.",
      "Oh, there s so much that s important,  said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Why, what?",
      "Oh, so much that s more important,  answered Varenka, not knowing what\nto say.",
      "But at that instant they heard the princess s voice from the\nwindow.",
      "Kitty, it s cold!",
      "Either get a shawl, or come indoors.",
      "It really is time to go in!",
      "said Varenka, getting up.",
      "I have to go\non to Madame Berthe s; she asked me to.",
      "Kitty held her by the hand, and with passionate curiosity and entreaty\nher eyes asked her:  What is it, what is this of such importance that\ngives you such tranquillity?",
      "You know, tell me!",
      "But Varenka did not\neven know what Kitty s eyes were asking her.",
      "She merely thought that\nshe had to go to see Madame Berthe too that evening, and to make haste\nhome in time for _maman s_ tea at twelve o clock.",
      "She went indoors,\ncollected her music, and saying good-bye to everyone, was about to go.",
      "Allow me to see you home,  said the colonel.",
      "Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?",
      "chimed in the princess.",
      "Anyway, I ll send Parasha.",
      "Kitty saw that Varenka could hardly restrain a smile at the idea that\nshe needed an escort.",
      "No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me,  she said,\ntaking her hat.",
      "And kissing Kitty once more, without saying what was\nimportant, she stepped out courageously with the music under her arm\nand vanished into the twilight of the summer night, bearing away with\nher her secret of what was important and what gave her the calm and\ndignity so much to be envied.",
      "Chapter 33\n\nKitty made the acquaintance of Madame Stahl too, and this acquaintance,\ntogether with her friendship with Varenka, did not merely exercise a\ngreat influence on her, it also comforted her in her mental distress.",
      "She found this comfort through a completely new world being opened to\nher by means of this acquaintance, a world having nothing in common\nwith her past, an exalted, noble world, from the height of which she\ncould contemplate her past calmly.",
      "It was revealed to her that besides\nthe instinctive life to which Kitty had given herself up hitherto there\nwas a spiritual life.",
      "This life was disclosed in religion, but a\nreligion having nothing in common with that one which Kitty had known\nfrom childhood, and which found expression in litanies and all-night\nservices at the Widow s Home, where one might meet one s friends, and\nin learning by heart Slavonic texts with the priest.",
      "This was a lofty,\nmysterious religion connected with a whole series of noble thoughts and\nfeelings, which one could do more than merely believe because one was\ntold to, which one could love.",
      "Kitty found all this out not from words.",
      "Madame Stahl talked to Kitty\nas to a charming child that one looks on with pleasure as on the memory\nof one s youth, and only once she said in passing that in all human\nsorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith, and that in the sight\nof Christ s compassion for us no sorrow is trifling and immediately\ntalked of other things.",
      "But in every gesture of Madame Stahl, in every\nword, in every heavenly as Kitty called it look, and above all in the\nwhole story of her life, which she heard from Varenka, Kitty recognized\nthat something  that was important,  of which, till then, she had known\nnothing.",
      "Yet, elevated as Madame Stahl s character was, touching as was her\nstory, and exalted and moving as was her speech, Kitty could not help\ndetecting in her some traits which perplexed her.",
      "She noticed that when\nquestioning her about her family, Madame Stahl had smiled\ncontemptuously, which was not in accord with Christian meekness.",
      "She\nnoticed, too, that when she had found a Catholic priest with her,\nMadame Stahl had studiously kept her face in the shadow of the\nlamp-shade and had smiled in a peculiar way.",
      "Trivial as these two\nobservations were, they perplexed her, and she had her doubts as to\nMadame Stahl.",
      "But on the other hand Varenka, alone in the world,\nwithout friends or relations, with a melancholy disappointment in the\npast, desiring nothing, regretting nothing, was just that perfection of\nwhich Kitty dared hardly dream.",
      "In Varenka she realized that one has\nbut to forget oneself and love others, and one will be calm, happy, and\nnoble.",
      "And that was what Kitty longed to be.",
      "Seeing now clearly what\nwas _the most important_, Kitty was not satisfied with being\nenthusiastic over it; she at once gave herself up with her whole soul\nto the new life that was opening to her.",
      "From Varenka s accounts of the\ndoings of Madame Stahl and other people whom she mentioned, Kitty had\nalready constructed the plan of her own future life.",
      "She would, like\nMadame Stahl s niece, Aline, of whom Varenka had talked to her a great\ndeal, seek out those who were in trouble, wherever she might be living,\nhelp them as far as she could, give them the Gospel, read the Gospel to\nthe sick, to criminals, to the dying.",
      "The idea of reading the Gospel to\ncriminals, as Aline did, particularly fascinated Kitty.",
      "But all these\nwere secret dreams, of which Kitty did not talk either to her mother or\nto Varenka.",
      "While awaiting the time for carrying out her plans on a large scale,\nhowever, Kitty, even then at the springs, where there were so many\npeople ill and unhappy, readily found a chance for practicing her new\nprinciples in imitation of Varenka.",
      "At first the princess noticed nothing but that Kitty was much under the\ninfluence of her _engouement_, as she called it, for Madame Stahl, and\nstill more for Varenka.",
      "She saw that Kitty did not merely imitate\nVarenka in her conduct, but unconsciously imitated her in her manner of\nwalking, of talking, of blinking her eyes.",
      "But later on the princess\nnoticed that, apart from this adoration, some kind of serious spiritual\nchange was taking place in her daughter.",
      "The princess saw that in the evenings Kitty read a French testament\nthat Madame Stahl had given her a thing she had never done before; that\nshe avoided society acquaintances and associated with the sick people\nwho were under Varenka s protection, and especially one poor family,\nthat of a sick painter, Petrov.",
      "Kitty was unmistakably proud of playing\nthe part of a sister of mercy in that family.",
      "All this was well enough,\nand the princess had nothing to say against it, especially as Petrov s\nwife was a perfectly nice sort of woman, and that the German princess,\nnoticing Kitty s devotion, praised her, calling her an angel of\nconsolation.",
      "All this would have been very well, if there had been no\nexaggeration.",
      "But the princess saw that her daughter was rushing into\nextremes, and so indeed she told her.",
      "_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_,  she said to her.",
      "Her daughter made her no reply, only in her heart she thought that one\ncould not talk about exaggeration where Christianity was concerned.",
      "What exaggeration could there be in the practice of a doctrine wherein\none was bidden to turn the other cheek when one was smitten, and give\none s cloak if one s coat were taken?",
      "But the princess disliked this\nexaggeration, and disliked even more the fact that she felt her\ndaughter did not care to show her all her heart.",
      "Kitty did in fact\nconceal her new views and feelings from her mother.",
      "She concealed them\nnot because she did not respect or did not love her mother, but simply\nbecause she was her mother.",
      "She would have revealed them to anyone\nsooner than to her mother.",
      "How is it Anna Pavlovna s not been to see us for so long?",
      "the\nprincess said one day of Madame Petrova.",
      "I ve asked her, but she seems\nput out about something.",
      "No, I ve not noticed it, maman,  said Kitty, flushing hotly.",
      "Is it long since you went to see them?",
      "We re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow, \nanswered Kitty.",
      "Well, you can go,  answered the princess, gazing at her daughter s\nembarrassed face and trying to guess the cause of her embarrassment.",
      "That day Varenka came to dinner and told them that Anna Pavlovna had\nchanged her mind and given up the expedition for the morrow.",
      "And the\nprincess noticed again that Kitty reddened.",
      "Kitty, haven t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?",
      "said\nthe princess, when they were left alone.",
      "Why has she given up sending\nthe children and coming to see us?",
      "Kitty answered that nothing had happened between them, and that she\ncould not tell why Anna Pavlovna seemed displeased with her.",
      "Kitty\nanswered perfectly truly.",
      "She did not know the reason Anna Pavlovna had\nchanged to her, but she guessed it.",
      "She guessed at something which she\ncould not tell her mother, which she did not put into words to herself.",
      "It was one of those things which one knows but which one can never\nspeak of even to oneself, so terrible and shameful would it be to be\nmistaken.",
      "Again and again she went over in her memory all her relations with the\nfamily.",
      "She remembered the simple delight expressed on the round,\ngood-humored face of Anna Pavlovna at their meetings; she remembered\ntheir secret confabulations about the invalid, their plots to draw him\naway from the work which was forbidden him, and to get him\nout-of-doors; the devotion of the youngest boy, who used to call her\n my Kitty,  and would not go to bed without her.",
      "How nice it all was!",
      "Then she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his\nlong neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning\nblue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful\nattempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence.",
      "She recalled the\nefforts she had made at first to overcome the repugnance she felt for\nhim, as for all consumptive people, and the pains it had cost her to\nthink of things to say to him.",
      "She recalled the timid, softened look\nwith which he gazed at her, and the strange feeling of compassion and\nawkwardness, and later of a sense of her own goodness, which she had\nfelt at it.",
      "How nice it all was!",
      "But all that was at first.",
      "Now, a few\ndays ago, everything was suddenly spoiled.",
      "Anna Pavlovna had met Kitty\nwith affected cordiality, and had kept continual watch on her and on\nher husband.",
      "Could that touching pleasure he showed when she came near be the cause\nof Anna Pavlovna s coolness?",
      "Yes,  she mused,  there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna,\nand utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day\nbefore yesterday:  There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn t\ndrink his coffee without you, though he s grown so dreadfully weak.",
      "Yes, perhaps, too, she didn t like it when I gave him the rug.",
      "It was\nall so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking\nme, that I felt awkward too.",
      "And then that portrait of me he did so\nwell.",
      "And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness!",
      "Yes, yes,\nthat s it!",
      "Kitty repeated to herself with horror.",
      "No, it can t be, it\noughtn t to be!",
      "He s so much to be pitied!",
      "she said to herself\ndirectly after.",
      "This doubt poisoned the charm of her new life.",
      "Chapter 34\n\nBefore the end of the course of drinking the waters, Prince\nShtcherbatsky, who had gone on from Carlsbad to Baden and Kissingen to\nRussian friends to get a breath of Russian air, as he said came back to\nhis wife and daughter.",
      "The views of the prince and of the princess on life abroad were\ncompletely opposed.",
      "The princess thought everything delightful, and in\nspite of her established position in Russian society, she tried abroad\nto be like a European fashionable lady, which she was not for the\nsimple reason that she was a typical Russian gentlewoman; and so she\nwas affected, which did not altogether suit her.",
      "The prince, on the\ncontrary, thought everything foreign detestable, got sick of European\nlife, kept to his Russian habits, and purposely tried to show himself\nabroad less European than he was in reality.",
      "The prince returned thinner, with the skin hanging in loose bags on his\ncheeks, but in the most cheerful frame of mind.",
      "His good humor was even\ngreater when he saw Kitty completely recovered.",
      "The news of Kitty s\nfriendship with Madame Stahl and Varenka, and the reports the princess\ngave him of some kind of change she had noticed in Kitty, troubled the\nprince and aroused his habitual feeling of jealousy of everything that\ndrew his daughter away from him, and a dread that his daughter might\nhave got out of the reach of his influence into regions inaccessible to\nhim.",
      "But these unpleasant matters were all drowned in the sea of\nkindliness and good humor which was always within him, and more so than\never since his course of Carlsbad waters.",
      "The day after his arrival the prince, in his long overcoat, with his\nRussian wrinkles and baggy cheeks propped up by a starched collar, set\noff with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.",
      "It was a lovely morning: the bright, cheerful houses with their little\ngardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German\nwaitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good.",
      "But the nearer\nthey got to the springs the oftener they met sick people; and their\nappearance seemed more pitiable than ever among the everyday conditions\nof prosperous German life.",
      "Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast.",
      "The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the\nmusic were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces,\nwith their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which\nshe watched.",
      "But to the prince the brightness and gaiety of the June\nmorning, and the sound of the orchestra playing a gay waltz then in\nfashion, and above all, the appearance of the healthy attendants,\nseemed something unseemly and monstrous, in conjunction with these\nslowly moving, dying figures gathered together from all parts of\nEurope.",
      "In spite of his feeling of pride and, as it were, of the return\nof youth, with his favorite daughter on his arm, he felt awkward, and\nalmost ashamed of his vigorous step and his sturdy, stout limbs.",
      "He\nfelt almost like a man not dressed in a crowd.",
      "Present me to your new friends,  he said to his daughter, squeezing\nher hand with his elbow.",
      "I like even your horrid Soden for making you\nso well again.",
      "Only it s melancholy, very melancholy here.",
      "Who s that?",
      "Kitty mentioned the names of all the people they met, with some of whom\nshe was acquainted and some not.",
      "At the entrance of the garden they met\nthe blind lady, Madame Berthe, with her guide, and the prince was\ndelighted to see the old Frenchwoman s face light up when she heard\nKitty s voice.",
      "She at once began talking to him with French exaggerated\npoliteness, applauding him for having such a delightful daughter,\nextolling Kitty to the skies before her face, and calling her a\ntreasure, a pearl, and a consoling angel.",
      "Well, she s the second angel, then,  said the prince, smiling.",
      "she\ncalls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.",
      "Oh!",
      "Mademoiselle Varenka, she s a real angel, allez,  Madame Berthe\nassented.",
      "In the arcade they met Varenka herself.",
      "She was walking rapidly towards\nthem carrying an elegant red bag.",
      "Here is papa come,  Kitty said to her.",
      "Varenka made simply and naturally as she did everything a movement\nbetween a bow and a curtsey, and immediately began talking to the\nprince, without shyness, naturally, as she talked to everyone.",
      "Of course I know you; I know you very well,  the prince said to her\nwith a smile, in which Kitty detected with joy that her father liked\nher friend.",
      "Where are you off to in such haste?",
      "Maman s here,  she said, turning to Kitty.",
      "She has not slept all\nnight, and the doctor advised her to go out.",
      "I m taking her her work.",
      "So that s angel number one?",
      "said the prince when Varenka had gone on.",
      "Kitty saw that her father had meant to make fun of Varenka, but that he\ncould not do it because he liked her.",
      "Come, so we shall see all your friends,  he went on,  even Madame\nStahl, if she deigns to recognize me.",
      "Why, did you know her, papa?",
      "Kitty asked apprehensively, catching the\ngleam of irony that kindled in the prince s eyes at the mention of\nMadame Stahl.",
      "I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she d joined\nthe Pietists.",
      "What is a Pietist, papa?",
      "asked Kitty, dismayed to find that what she\nprized so highly in Madame Stahl had a name.",
      "I don t quite know myself.",
      "I only know that she thanks God for\neverything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her husband\ndied.",
      "And that s rather droll, as they didn t get on together.",
      "Who s that?",
      "What a piteous face!",
      "he asked, noticing a sick man of\nmedium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white\ntrousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs.",
      "This man lifted his straw hat, showed his scanty curly hair and high\nforehead, painfully reddened by the pressure of the hat.",
      "That s Petrov, an artist,  answered Kitty, blushing.",
      "And that s his\nwife,  she added, indicating Anna Pavlovna, who, as though on purpose,\nat the very instant they approached walked away after a child that had\nrun off along a path.",
      "Poor fellow!",
      "and what a nice face he has!",
      "said the prince.",
      "Why don t\nyou go up to him?",
      "He wanted to speak to you.",
      "Well, let us go, then,  said Kitty, turning round resolutely.",
      "How are\nyou feeling today?",
      "she asked Petrov.",
      "Petrov got up, leaning on his stick, and looked shyly at the prince.",
      "This is my daughter,  said the prince.",
      "Let me introduce myself.",
      "The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white\nteeth.",
      "We expected you yesterday, princess,  he said to Kitty.",
      "He staggered\nas he said this, and then repeated the motion, trying to make it seem\nas if it had been intentional.",
      "I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you\nwere not going.",
      "Not going!",
      "said Petrov, blushing, and immediately beginning to cough,\nand his eyes sought his wife.",
      "Anita!",
      "Anita!",
      "he said loudly, and the\nswollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck.",
      "Anna Pavlovna came up.",
      "So you sent word to the princess that we weren t going!",
      "he whispered\nto her angrily, losing his voice.",
      "Good morning, princess,  said Anna Pavlovna, with an assumed smile\nutterly unlike her former manner.",
      "Very glad to make your\nacquaintance,  she said to the prince.",
      "You ve long been expected,\nprince.",
      "What did you send word to the princess that we weren t going for?",
      "the\nartist whispered hoarsely once more, still more angrily, obviously\nexasperated that his voice failed him so that he could not give his\nwords the expression he would have liked to.",
      "Oh, mercy on us!",
      "I thought we weren t going,  his wife answered\ncrossly.",
      "What, when....",
      "He coughed and waved his hand.",
      "The prince took off his\nhat and moved away with his daughter.",
      "Ah!",
      "ah!",
      "he sighed deeply.",
      "Oh, poor things!",
      "Yes, papa,  answered Kitty.",
      "And you must know they ve three children,\nno servant, and scarcely any means.",
      "He gets something from the\nAcademy,  she went on briskly, trying to drown the distress that the\nqueer change in Anna Pavlovna s manner to her had aroused in her.",
      "Oh, here s Madame Stahl,  said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage,\nwhere, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a\nsunshade.",
      "This was Madame Stahl.",
      "Behind her stood the gloomy,\nhealthy-looking German workman who pushed the carriage.",
      "Close by was\nstanding a flaxen-headed Swedish count, whom Kitty knew by name.",
      "Several invalids were lingering near the low carriage, staring at the\nlady as though she were some curiosity.",
      "The prince went up to her, and Kitty detected that disconcerting gleam\nof irony in his eyes.",
      "He went up to Madame Stahl, and addressed her\nwith extreme courtesy and affability in that excellent French that so\nfew speak nowadays.",
      "I don t know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you\nfor your kindness to my daughter,  he said, taking off his hat and not\nputting it on again.",
      "Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,  said Madame Stahl, lifting upon him\nher heavenly eyes, in which Kitty discerned a look of annoyance.",
      "Delighted!",
      "I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.",
      "You are still in weak health?",
      "Yes; I m used to it,  said Madame Stahl, and she introduced the prince\nto the Swedish count.",
      "You are scarcely changed at all,  the prince said to her.",
      "It s ten or\neleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.",
      "Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it.",
      "Often one\nwonders what is the goal of this life?...",
      "The other side!",
      "she said\nangrily to Varenka, who had rearranged the rug over her feet not to her\nsatisfaction.",
      "To do good, probably,  said the prince with a twinkle in his eye.",
      "That is not for us to judge,  said Madame Stahl, perceiving the shade\nof expression on the prince s face.",
      "So you will send me that book,\ndear count?",
      "I m very grateful to you,  she said to the young Swede.",
      "Ah!",
      "cried the prince, catching sight of the Moscow colonel standing\nnear, and with a bow to Madame Stahl he walked away with his daughter\nand the Moscow colonel, who joined them.",
      "That s our aristocracy, prince!",
      "the Moscow colonel said with ironical\nintention.",
      "He cherished a grudge against Madame Stahl for not making\nhis acquaintance.",
      "She s just the same,  replied the prince.",
      "Did you know her before her illness, prince that s to say before she\ntook to her bed?",
      "Yes.",
      "She took to her bed before my eyes,  said the prince.",
      "They say it s ten years since she has stood on her feet.",
      "She doesn t stand up because her legs are too short.",
      "She s a very bad\nfigure.",
      "Papa, it s not possible!",
      "cried Kitty.",
      "That s what wicked tongues say, my darling.",
      "And your Varenka catches\nit too,  he added.",
      "Oh, these invalid ladies!",
      "Oh, no, papa!",
      "Kitty objected warmly.",
      "Varenka worships her.",
      "And then\nshe does so much good!",
      "Ask anyone!",
      "Everyone knows her and Aline Stahl.",
      "Perhaps so,  said the prince, squeezing her hand with his elbow;  but\nit s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one\nknows.",
      "Kitty did not answer, not because she had nothing to say, but because\nshe did not care to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father.",
      "But,\nstrange to say, although she had so made up her mind not to be\ninfluenced by her father s views, not to let him into her inmost\nsanctuary, she felt that the heavenly image of Madame Stahl, which she\nhad carried for a whole month in her heart, had vanished, never to\nreturn, just as the fantastic figure made up of some clothes thrown\ndown at random vanishes when one sees that it is only some garment\nlying there.",
      "All that was left was a woman with short legs, who lay\ndown because she had a bad figure, and worried patient Varenka for not\narranging her rug to her liking.",
      "And by no effort of the imagination\ncould Kitty bring back the former Madame Stahl.",
      "Chapter 35\n\nThe prince communicated his good humor to his own family and his\nfriends, and even to the German landlord in whose rooms the\nShtcherbatskys were staying.",
      "On coming back with Kitty from the springs, the prince, who had asked\nthe colonel, and Marya Yevgenyevna, and Varenka all to come and have\ncoffee with them, gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into\nthe garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there.",
      "The\nlandlord and the servants, too, grew brisker under the influence of his\ngood spirits.",
      "They knew his open-handedness; and half an hour later the\ninvalid doctor from Hamburg, who lived on the top floor, looked\nenviously out of the window at the merry party of healthy Russians\nassembled under the chestnut tree.",
      "In the trembling circles of shadow\ncast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set\nwith coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the\nprincess in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and\nbread-and-butter.",
      "At the other end sat the prince, eating heartily, and\ntalking loudly and merrily.",
      "The prince had spread out near him his\npurchases, carved boxes, and knick-knacks, paper-knives of all sorts,\nof which he bought a heap at every watering-place, and bestowed them\nupon everyone, including Lieschen, the servant girl, and the landlord,\nwith whom he jested in his comically bad German, assuring him that it\nwas not the water had cured Kitty, but his splendid cookery, especially\nhis plum soup.",
      "The princess laughed at her husband for his Russian\nways, but she was more lively and good-humored than she had been all\nthe while she had been at the waters.",
      "The colonel smiled, as he always\ndid, at the prince s jokes, but as far as regards Europe, of which he\nbelieved himself to be making a careful study, he took the princess s\nside.",
      "The simple-hearted Marya Yevgenyevna simply roared with laughter\nat everything absurd the prince said, and his jokes made Varenka\nhelpless with feeble but infectious laughter, which was something Kitty\nhad never seen before.",
      "Kitty was glad of all this, but she could not be light-hearted.",
      "She\ncould not solve the problem her father had unconsciously set her by his\ngood-humored view of her friends, and of the life that had so attracted\nher.",
      "To this doubt there was joined the change in her relations with\nthe Petrovs, which had been so conspicuously and unpleasantly marked\nthat morning.",
      "Everyone was good-humored, but Kitty could not feel\ngood-humored, and this increased her distress.",
      "She felt a feeling such\nas she had known in childhood, when she had been shut in her room as a\npunishment, and had heard her sisters  merry laughter outside.",
      "Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?",
      "said the\nprincess, smiling, and handing her husband a cup of coffee.",
      "One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy.",
      "_Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?_  Directly they say  _Durchlaucht_,  I can t\nhold out.",
      "I lose ten thalers.",
      "It s simply from boredom,  said the princess.",
      "Of course it is.",
      "Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn t know what to\ndo with oneself.",
      "How can you be bored, prince?",
      "There s so much that s interesting now\nin Germany,  said Marya Yevgenyevna.",
      "But I know everything that s interesting: the plum soup I know, and\nthe pea sausages I know.",
      "I know everything.",
      "No, you may say what you like, prince, there s the interest of their\ninstitutions,  said the colonel.",
      "But what is there interesting about it?",
      "They re all as pleased as\nbrass halfpence.",
      "They ve conquered everybody, and why am I to be\npleased at that?",
      "I haven t conquered anyone; and I m obliged to take\noff my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up\nand dress at once, and go to the dining-room to drink bad tea!",
      "How\ndifferent it is at home!",
      "You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble\na little, and come round again.",
      "You ve time to think things over, and\nno hurry.",
      "But time s money, you forget that,  said the colonel.",
      "Time, indeed, that depends!",
      "Why, there s time one would give a month\nof for sixpence, and time you wouldn t give half an hour of for any\nmoney.",
      "Isn t that so, Katinka?",
      "What is it?",
      "why are you so depressed?",
      "I m not depressed.",
      "Where are you off to?",
      "Stay a little longer,  he said to Varenka.",
      "I must be going home,  said Varenka, getting up, and again she went\noff into a giggle.",
      "When she had recovered, she said good-bye, and went\ninto the house to get her hat.",
      "Kitty followed her.",
      "Even Varenka struck her as different.",
      "She was not\nworse, but different from what she had fancied her before.",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "it s a long while since I ve laughed so much!",
      "said Varenka,\ngathering up her parasol and her bag.",
      "How nice he is, your father!",
      "Kitty did not speak.",
      "When shall I see you again?",
      "asked Varenka.",
      "Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs.",
      "Won t you be there?",
      "said\nKitty, to try Varenka.",
      "Yes,  answered Varenka.",
      "They re getting ready to go away, so I\npromised to help them pack.",
      "Well, I ll come too, then.",
      "No, why should you?",
      "Why not?",
      "why not?",
      "why not?",
      "said Kitty, opening her eyes wide, and\nclutching at Varenka s parasol, so as not to let her go.",
      "No, wait a\nminute; why not?",
      "Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward\nat your helping.",
      "No, tell me why you don t want me to be often at the Petrovs .",
      "You\ndon t want me to why not?",
      "I didn t say that,  said Varenka quietly.",
      "No, please tell me!",
      "Tell you everything?",
      "asked Varenka.",
      "Everything, everything!",
      "Kitty assented.",
      "Well, there s really nothing of any consequence; only that Mihail\nAlexeyevitch  (that was the artist s name)  had meant to leave earlier,\nand now he doesn t want to go away,  said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Well, well!",
      "Kitty urged impatiently, looking darkly at Varenka.",
      "Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn t want\nto go because you are here.",
      "Of course, that was nonsense; but there was\na dispute over it over you.",
      "You know how irritable these sick people\nare.",
      "Kitty, scowling more than ever, kept silent, and Varenka went on\nspeaking alone, trying to soften or soothe her, and seeing a storm\ncoming she did not know whether of tears or of words.",
      "So you d better not go.... You understand; you won t be offended?...",
      "And it serves me right!",
      "And it serves me right!",
      "Kitty cried quickly,\nsnatching the parasol out of Varenka s hand, and looking past her\nfriend s face.",
      "Varenka felt inclined to smile, looking at her childish fury, but she\nwas afraid of wounding her.",
      "How does it serve you right?",
      "I don t understand,  she said.",
      "It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all done\non purpose, and not from the heart.",
      "What business had I to interfere\nwith outsiders?",
      "And so it s come about that I m a cause of quarrel, and\nthat I ve done what nobody asked me to do.",
      "Because it was all a sham!",
      "a\nsham!",
      "a sham!...",
      "A sham!",
      "with what object?",
      "said Varenka gently.",
      "Oh, it s so idiotic!",
      "so hateful!",
      "There was no need whatever for me....",
      "Nothing but sham!",
      "she said, opening and shutting the parasol.",
      "But with what object?",
      "To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone.",
      "No!",
      "now I won t descend to that.",
      "I ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a\ncheat.",
      "But who is a cheat?",
      "said Varenka reproachfully.",
      "You speak as if....",
      "But Kitty was in one of her gusts of fury, and she would not let her\nfinish.",
      "I don t talk about you, not about you at all.",
      "You re perfection.",
      "Yes,\nyes, I know you re all perfection; but what am I to do if I m bad?",
      "This\nwould never have been if I weren t bad.",
      "So let me be what I am.",
      "I won t\nbe a sham.",
      "What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna?",
      "Let them go their way,\nand me go mine.",
      "I can t be different.... And yet it s not that, it s\nnot that.",
      "What is not that?",
      "asked Varenka in bewilderment.",
      "Everything.",
      "I can t act except from the heart, and you act from\nprinciple.",
      "I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save\nme, to improve me.",
      "You are unjust,  said Varenka.",
      "But I m not speaking of other people, I m speaking of myself.",
      "Kitty,  they heard her mother s voice,  come here, show papa your\nnecklace.",
      "Kitty, with a haughty air, without making peace with her friend, took\nthe necklace in a little box from the table and went to her mother.",
      "What s the matter?",
      "Why are you so red?",
      "her mother and father said to\nher with one voice.",
      "Nothing,  she answered.",
      "I ll be back directly,  and she ran back.",
      "She s still here,  she thought.",
      "What am I to say to her?",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "what have I done, what have I said?",
      "Why was I rude to her?",
      "What am I to\ndo?",
      "What am I to say to her?",
      "thought Kitty, and she stopped in the\ndoorway.",
      "Varenka in her hat and with the parasol in her hands was sitting at the\ntable examining the spring which Kitty had broken.",
      "She lifted her head.",
      "Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,  whispered Kitty, going up to her.",
      "I don t remember what I said.",
      "I....",
      "I really didn t mean to hurt you,  said Varenka, smiling.",
      "Peace was made.",
      "But with her father s coming all the world in which she\nhad been living was transformed for Kitty.",
      "She did not give up\neverything she had learned, but she became aware that she had deceived\nherself in supposing she could be what she wanted to be.",
      "Her eyes were,\nit seemed, opened; she felt all the difficulty of maintaining herself\nwithout hypocrisy and self-conceit on the pinnacle to which she had\nwished to mount.",
      "Moreover, she became aware of all the dreariness of\nthe world of sorrow, of sick and dying people, in which she had been\nliving.",
      "The efforts she had made to like it seemed to her intolerable,\nand she felt a longing to get back quickly into the fresh air, to\nRussia, to Ergushovo, where, as she knew from letters, her sister Dolly\nhad already gone with her children.",
      "But her affection for Varenka did not wane.",
      "As she said good-bye, Kitty\nbegged her to come to them in Russia.",
      "I ll come when you get married,  said Varenka.",
      "I shall never marry.",
      "Well, then, I shall never come.",
      "Well, then, I shall be married simply for that.",
      "Mind now, remember\nyour promise,  said Kitty.",
      "The doctor s prediction was fulfilled.",
      "Kitty returned home to Russia\ncured.",
      "She was not so gay and thoughtless as before, but she was\nserene.",
      "Her Moscow troubles had become a memory to her.",
      "PART THREE\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nSergey Ivanovitch Koznishev wanted a rest from mental work, and instead\nof going abroad as he usually did, he came towards the end of May to\nstay in the country with his brother.",
      "In his judgment the best sort of\nlife was a country life.",
      "He had come now to enjoy such a life at his\nbrother s. Konstantin Levin was very glad to have him, especially as he\ndid not expect his brother Nikolay that summer.",
      "But in spite of his\naffection and respect for Sergey Ivanovitch, Konstantin Levin was\nuncomfortable with his brother in the country.",
      "It made him\nuncomfortable, and it positively annoyed him to see his brother s\nattitude to the country.",
      "To Konstantin Levin the country was the\nbackground of life, that is of pleasures, endeavors, labor.",
      "To Sergey\nIvanovitch the country meant on one hand rest from work, on the other a\nvaluable antidote to the corrupt influences of town, which he took with\nsatisfaction and a sense of its utility.",
      "To Konstantin Levin the\ncountry was good first because it afforded a field for labor, of the\nusefulness of which there could be no doubt.",
      "To Sergey Ivanovitch the\ncountry was particularly good, because there it was possible and\nfitting to do nothing.",
      "Moreover, Sergey Ivanovitch s attitude to the\npeasants rather piqued Konstantin.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch used to say that\nhe knew and liked the peasantry, and he often talked to the peasants,\nwhich he knew how to do without affectation or condescension, and from\nevery such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of\nthe peasantry and in confirmation of his knowing them.",
      "Konstantin Levin\ndid not like such an attitude to the peasants.",
      "To Konstantin the\npeasant was simply the chief partner in their common labor, and in\nspite of all the respect and the love, almost like that of kinship, he\nhad for the peasant sucked in probably, as he said himself, with the\nmilk of his peasant nurse still as a fellow-worker with him, while\nsometimes enthusiastic over the vigor, gentleness, and justice of these\nmen, he was very often, when their common labors called for other\nqualities, exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness, lack of\nmethod, drunkenness, and lying.",
      "If he had been asked whether he liked\nor didn t like the peasants, Konstantin Levin would have been\nabsolutely at a loss what to reply.",
      "He liked and did not like the\npeasants, just as he liked and did not like men in general.",
      "Of course,\nbeing a good-hearted man, he liked men rather than he disliked them,\nand so too with the peasants.",
      "But like or dislike  the people  as\nsomething apart he could not, not only because he lived with  the\npeople,  and all his interests were bound up with theirs, but also\nbecause he regarded himself as a part of  the people,  did not see any\nspecial qualities or failings distinguishing himself and  the people, \nand could not contrast himself with them.",
      "Moreover, although he had\nlived so long in the closest relations with the peasants, as farmer and\narbitrator, and what was more, as adviser (the peasants trusted him,\nand for thirty miles round they would come to ask his advice), he had\nno definite views of  the people,  and would have been as much at a\nloss to answer the question whether he knew  the people  as the\nquestion whether he liked them.",
      "For him to say he knew the peasantry\nwould have been the same as to say he knew men.",
      "He was continually\nwatching and getting to know people of all sorts, and among them\npeasants, whom he regarded as good and interesting people, and he was\ncontinually observing new points in them, altering his former views of\nthem and forming new ones.",
      "With Sergey Ivanovitch it was quite the\ncontrary.",
      "Just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison\nwith the life he did not like, so too he liked the peasantry in\ncontradistinction to the class of men he did not like, and so too he\nknew the peasantry as something distinct from and opposed to men\ngenerally.",
      "In his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated\ncertain aspects of peasant life, deduced partly from that life itself,\nbut chiefly from contrast with other modes of life.",
      "He never changed\nhis opinion of the peasantry and his sympathetic attitude towards them.",
      "In the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of\nthe peasantry, Sergey Ivanovitch always got the better of his brother,\nprecisely because Sergey Ivanovitch had definite ideas about the\npeasant his character, his qualities, and his tastes.",
      "Konstantin Levin\nhad no definite and unalterable idea on the subject, and so in their\narguments Konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself.",
      "In Sergey Ivanovitch s eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow,\n_with his heart in the right place_ (as he expressed it in French), but\nwith a mind which, though fairly quick, was too much influenced by the\nimpressions of the moment, and consequently filled with contradictions.",
      "With all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained\nto him the true import of things, but he derived little satisfaction\nfrom arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily.",
      "Konstantin Levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and\nculture, as generous in the highest sense of the word, and possessed of\na special faculty for working for the public good.",
      "But in the depths of\nhis heart, the older he became, and the more intimately he knew his\nbrother, the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this\nfaculty of working for the public good, of which he felt himself\nutterly devoid, was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of\nsomething not a lack of good, honest, noble desires and tastes, but a\nlack of vital force, of what is called heart, of that impulse which\ndrives a man to choose someone out of the innumerable paths of life,\nand to care only for that one.",
      "The better he knew his brother, the more\nhe noticed that Sergey Ivanovitch, and many other people who worked for\nthe public welfare, were not led by an impulse of the heart to care for\nthe public good, but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it\nwas a right thing to take interest in public affairs, and consequently\ntook interest in them.",
      "Levin was confirmed in this generalization by\nobserving that his brother did not take questions affecting the public\nwelfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to\nheart than he did chess problems, or the ingenious construction of a\nnew machine.",
      "Besides this, Konstantin Levin was not at his ease with his brother,\nbecause in summer in the country Levin was continually busy with work\non the land, and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get\nthrough all he had to do, while Sergey Ivanovitch was taking a holiday.",
      "But though he was taking a holiday now, that is to say, he was doing no\nwriting, he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put\ninto concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him, and\nliked to have someone to listen to him.",
      "His most usual and natural\nlistener was his brother.",
      "And so in spite of the friendliness and\ndirectness of their relations, Konstantin felt an awkwardness in\nleaving him alone.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch liked to stretch himself on the\ngrass in the sun, and to lie so, basking and chatting lazily.",
      "You wouldn t believe,  he would say to his brother,  what a pleasure\nthis rural laziness is to me.",
      "Not an idea in one s brain, as empty as a\ndrum!",
      "But Konstantin Levin found it dull sitting and listening to him,\nespecially when he knew that while he was away they would be carting\ndung onto the fields not ploughed ready for it, and heaping it all up\nanyhow; and would not screw the shares in the ploughs, but would let\nthem come off and then say that the new ploughs were a silly invention,\nand there was nothing like the old Andreevna plough, and so on.",
      "Come, you ve done enough trudging about in the heat,  Sergey\nIvanovitch would say to him.",
      "No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a minute,  Levin\nwould answer, and he would run off to the fields.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nEarly in June it happened that Agafea Mihalovna, the old nurse and\nhousekeeper, in carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms she had just\npickled, slipped, fell, and sprained her wrist.",
      "The district doctor, a\ntalkative young medical student, who had just finished his studies,\ncame to see her.",
      "He examined the wrist, said it was not broken, was\ndelighted at a chance of talking to the celebrated Sergey Ivanovitch\nKoznishev, and to show his advanced views of things told him all the\nscandal of the district, complaining of the poor state into which the\ndistrict council had fallen.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch listened attentively,\nasked him questions, and, roused by a new listener, he talked fluently,\nuttered a few keen and weighty observations, respectfully appreciated\nby the young doctor, and was soon in that eager frame of mind his\nbrother knew so well, which always, with him, followed a brilliant and\neager conversation.",
      "After the departure of the doctor, he wanted to go\nwith a fishing rod to the river.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was fond of angling,\nand was, it seemed, proud of being able to care for such a stupid\noccupation.",
      "Konstantin Levin, whose presence was needed in the plough land and\nmeadows, had come to take his brother in the trap.",
      "It was that time of the year, the turning-point of summer, when the\ncrops of the present year are a certainty, when one begins to think of\nthe sowing for next year, and the mowing is at hand; when the rye is\nall in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves\nin gray-green billows in the wind; when the green oats, with tufts of\nyellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over\nthe late-sown fields; when the early buckwheat is already out and\nhiding the ground; when the fallow lands, trodden hard as stone by the\ncattle, are half ploughed over, with paths left untouched by the\nplough; when from the dry dung-heaps carted onto the fields there comes\nat sunset a smell of manure mixed with meadow-sweet, and on the\nlow-lying lands the riverside meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting\nfor the mowing, with blackened heaps of the stalks of sorrel among it.",
      "It was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the\nfields before the beginning of the labors of harvest every year\nrecurring, every year straining every nerve of the peasants.",
      "The crop\nwas a splendid one, and bright, hot summer days had set in with short,\ndewy nights.",
      "The brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods,\nwhich were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his brother now an\nold lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and\nbrightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this\nyear s saplings brilliant with emerald.",
      "Konstantin Levin did not like\ntalking and hearing about the beauty of nature.",
      "Words for him took away\nthe beauty of what he saw.",
      "He assented to what his brother said, but he\ncould not help beginning to think of other things.",
      "When they came out\nof the woods, all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow\nland on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and\ncheckered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in\nparts even ploughed.",
      "A string of carts was moving across it.",
      "Levin\ncounted the carts, and was pleased that all that were wanted had been\nbrought, and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the\nmowing.",
      "He always felt something special moving him to the quick at the\nhay-making.",
      "On reaching the meadow Levin stopped the horse.",
      "The morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass,\nand that he might not get his feet wet, Sergey Ivanovitch asked his\nbrother to drive him in the trap up to the willow tree from which the\ncarp was caught.",
      "Sorry as Konstantin Levin was to crush down his mowing\ngrass, he drove him into the meadow.",
      "The high grass softly turned about\nthe wheels and the horse s legs, leaving its seeds clinging to the wet\naxles and spokes of the wheels.",
      "His brother seated himself under a\nbush, arranging his tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened\nhim up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by\nthe wind.",
      "The silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist\nin the dampest spots.",
      "Crossing the meadow, Konstantin Levin came out onto the road, and met\nan old man with a swollen eye, carrying a skep on his shoulder.",
      "What?",
      "taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?",
      "he asked.",
      "No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich!",
      "All we can do to keep our own!",
      "This\nis the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught\nthem.",
      "They were ploughing your field.",
      "They unyoked the horses and\ngalloped after them.",
      "Well, what do you say, Fomitch start mowing or wait a bit?",
      "Eh, well.",
      "Our way s to wait till St. Peter s Day.",
      "But you always mow\nsooner.",
      "Well, to be sure, please God, the hay s good.",
      "There ll be\nplenty for the beasts.",
      "What do you think about the weather?",
      "That s in God s hands.",
      "Maybe it will be fine.",
      "Levin went up to his brother.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had caught nothing, but he was not bored, and seemed\nin the most cheerful frame of mind.",
      "Levin saw that, stimulated by his\nconversation with the doctor, he wanted to talk.",
      "Levin, on the other\nhand, would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders\nabout getting together the mowers for next day, and to set at rest his\ndoubts about the mowing, which greatly absorbed him.",
      "Well, let s be going,  he said.",
      "Why be in such a hurry?",
      "Let s stay a little.",
      "But how wet you are!",
      "Even\nthough one catches nothing, it s nice.",
      "That s the best thing about\nevery part of sport, that one has to do with nature.",
      "How exquisite this\nsteely water is!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "These riverside banks always\nremind me of the riddle do you know it?",
      "The grass says to the water:\nwe quiver and we quiver.",
      "I don t know the riddle,  answered Levin wearily.",
      "Chapter 3\n\n Do you know, I ve been thinking about you,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "It s beyond everything what s being done in the district, according to\nwhat this doctor tells me.",
      "He s a very intelligent fellow.",
      "And as I ve\ntold you before, I tell you again: it s not right for you not to go to\nthe meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business.",
      "If\ndecent people won t go into it, of course it s bound to go all wrong.",
      "We pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no\nschools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor drugstores nothing.",
      "Well, I did try, you know,  Levin said slowly and unwillingly.",
      "I\ncan t!",
      "and so there s no help for it.",
      "But why can t you?",
      "I must own I can t make it out.",
      "Indifference,\nincapacity I won t admit; surely it s not simply laziness?",
      "None of those things.",
      "I ve tried, and I see I can do nothing,  said\nLevin.",
      "He had hardly grasped what his brother was saying.",
      "Looking towards the\nplough land across the river, he made out something black, but he could\nnot distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback.",
      "Why is it you can do nothing?",
      "You made an attempt and didn t succeed,\nas you think, and you give in.",
      "How can you have so little\nself-respect?",
      "Self-respect!",
      "said Levin, stung to the quick by his brother s words;\n I don t understand.",
      "If they d told me at college that other people\nunderstood the integral calculus, and I didn t, then pride would have\ncome in.",
      "But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has\ncertain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that\nall this business is of great importance.",
      "What!",
      "do you mean to say it s not of importance?",
      "said Sergey\nIvanovitch, stung to the quick too at his brother s considering\nanything of no importance that interested him, and still more at his\nobviously paying little attention to what he was saying.",
      "I don t think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can t help\nit,  answered Levin, making out that what he saw was the bailiff, and\nthat the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the ploughed\nland.",
      "They were turning the plough over.",
      "Can they have finished\nploughing?",
      "he wondered.",
      "Come, really though,  said the elder brother, with a frown on his\nhandsome, clever face,  there s a limit to everything.",
      "It s very well\nto be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional I\nknow all about that; but really, what you re saying either has no\nmeaning, or it has a very wrong meaning.",
      "How can you think it a matter\nof no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert....",
      "I never did assert it,  thought Konstantin Levin.",
      "...dies without help?",
      "The ignorant peasant-women starve the children,\nand the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of\nevery village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping\nthem, and don t help them because to your mind it s of no importance.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch put before him the alternative: either you are so\nundeveloped that you can t see all that you can do, or you won t\nsacrifice your ease, your vanity, or whatever it is, to do it.",
      "Konstantin Levin felt that there was no course open to him but to\nsubmit, or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good.",
      "And this\nmortified him and hurt his feelings.",
      "It s both,  he said resolutely:  I don t see that it was possible.... \n\n What!",
      "was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to\nprovide medical aid?",
      "Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square miles\nof our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in\nthe fields, I don t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all\nover.",
      "And besides, I don t believe in medicine.",
      "Oh, well, that s unfair ...",
      "I can quote to you thousands of\ninstances....",
      "But the schools, anyway.",
      "Why have schools?",
      "What do you mean?",
      "Can there be two opinions of the advantage of\neducation?",
      "If it s a good thing for you, it s a good thing for\neveryone.",
      "Konstantin Levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall, and so he\ngot hot, and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his\nindifference to public business.",
      "Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about\nestablishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools\nto which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants\ndon t want to send their children, and to which I ve no very firm faith\nthat they ought to send them?",
      "said he.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of\nthe subject; but he promptly made a new plan of attack.",
      "He was silent\nfor a little, drew out a hook, threw it in again, and turned to his\nbrother smiling.",
      "Come, now....",
      "In the first place, the dispensary is needed.",
      "We\nourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.",
      "That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and write\nis as a workman of more use and value to you.",
      "No, you can ask anyone you like,  Konstantin Levin answered with\ndecision,  the man that can read and write is much inferior as a\nworkman.",
      "And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as\nthey put up bridges they re stolen.",
      "Still, that s not the point,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, frowning.",
      "He\ndisliked contradiction, and still more, arguments that were continually\nskipping from one thing to another, introducing new and disconnected\npoints, so that there was no knowing to which to reply.",
      "Do you admit\nthat education is a benefit for the people?",
      "Yes, I admit it,  said Levin without thinking, and he was conscious\nimmediately that he had said what he did not think.",
      "He felt that if he\nadmitted that, it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless\nrubbish.",
      "How it would be proved he could not tell, but he knew that\nthis would inevitably be logically proved to him, and he awaited the\nproofs.",
      "The argument turned out to be far simpler than he had expected.",
      "If you admit that it is a benefit,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,  then, as\nan honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with\nthe movement, and so wishing to work for it.",
      "But I still do not admit this movement to be just,  said Konstantin\nLevin, reddening a little.",
      "What!",
      "But you said just now.... \n\n That s to say, I don t admit it s being either good or possible.",
      "That you can t tell without making the trial.",
      "Well, supposing that s so,  said Levin, though he did not suppose so\nat all,  supposing that is so, still I don t see, all the same, what\nI m to worry myself about it for.",
      "How so?",
      "No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical\npoint of view,  said Levin.",
      "I can t see where philosophy comes in,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, in a\ntone, Levin fancied, as though he did not admit his brother s right to\ntalk about philosophy.",
      "And that irritated Levin.",
      "I ll tell you, then,  he said with heat,  I imagine the mainspring of\nall our actions is, after all, self-interest.",
      "Now in the local\ninstitutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my\nprosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my\nhorses carry me well enough over bad ones.",
      "Doctors and dispensaries are\nno use to me.",
      "An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me.",
      "I never appeal\nto him, and never shall appeal to him.",
      "The schools are no good to me,\nbut positively harmful, as I told you.",
      "For me the district institutions\nsimply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three\nacres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts\nof idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no\ninducement.",
      "Excuse me,  Sergey Ivanovitch interposed with a smile,  self-interest\ndid not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did\nwork for it.",
      "No!",
      "Konstantin Levin broke in with still greater heat;  the\nemancipation of the serfs was a different matter.",
      "There self-interest\ndid come in.",
      "One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all\ndecent people among us.",
      "But to be a town councilor and discuss how many\ndustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town\nin which I don t live to serve on a jury and try a peasant who s stolen\na flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts\nof jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the\npresident cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka,  Do you admit,\nprisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?",
      "Eh?",
      "Konstantin Levin had warmed to his subject, and began mimicking the\npresident and the half-witted Alioshka: it seemed to him that it was\nall to the point.",
      "But Sergey Ivanovitch shrugged his shoulders.",
      "Well, what do you mean to say, then?",
      "I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest,\nI shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made\nraids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to\ndefend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and\nfreedom.",
      "I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my\nchildren, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what\nconcerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of\ndistrict council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka I don t\nunderstand, and I can t do it.",
      "Konstantin Levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst\nopen.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.",
      "But tomorrow it ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your\ntastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?",
      "I m not going to be tried.",
      "I shan t murder anybody, and I ve no need\nof it.",
      "Well, I tell you what,  he went on, flying off again to a\nsubject quite beside the point,  our district self-government and all\nthe rest of it it s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground\non Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up\nof itself in Europe, and I can t gush over these birch branches and\nbelieve in them.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch merely shrugged his shoulders, as though to express\nhis wonder how the birch branches had come into their argument at that\npoint, though he did really understand at once what his brother meant.",
      "Excuse me, but you know one really can t argue in that way,  he\nobserved.",
      "But Konstantin Levin wanted to justify himself for the failing, of\nwhich he was conscious, of lack of zeal for the public welfare, and he\nwent on.",
      "I imagine,  he said,  that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting\nif it is not founded on self-interest, that s a universal principle, a\nphilosophical principle,  he said, repeating the word  philosophical \nwith determination, as though wishing to show that he had as much right\nas anyone else to talk of philosophy.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.",
      "He too has a philosophy of his own at the\nservice of his natural tendencies,  he thought.",
      "Come, you d better let philosophy alone,  he said.",
      "The chief problem\nof the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the\nindispensable connection which exists between individual and social\ninterests.",
      "But that s not to the point; what is to the point is a\ncorrection I must make in your comparison.",
      "The birches are not simply\nstuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one must deal\ncarefully with them.",
      "It s only those peoples that have an intuitive\nsense of what s of importance and significance in their institutions,\nand know how to value them, that have a future before them it s only\nthose peoples that one can truly call historical.",
      "And Sergey Ivanovitch carried the subject into the regions of\nphilosophical history where Konstantin Levin could not follow him, and\nshowed him all the incorrectness of his view.",
      "As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that s simply our\nRussian sloth and old serf-owner s ways, and I m convinced that in you\nit s a temporary error and will pass.",
      "Konstantin was silent.",
      "He felt himself vanquished on all sides, but he\nfelt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to\nhis brother.",
      "Only he could not make up his mind whether it was\nunintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning\nclearly, or because his brother would not or could not understand him.",
      "But he did not pursue the speculation, and without replying, he fell to\nmusing on a quite different and personal matter.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wound up the last line, untied the horse, and they\ndrove off.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nThe personal matter that absorbed Levin during his conversation with\nhis brother was this.",
      "Once in a previous year he had gone to look at\nthe mowing, and being made very angry by the bailiff he had recourse to\nhis favorite means for regaining his temper, he took a scythe from a\npeasant and began mowing.",
      "He liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at\nmowing since.",
      "He had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house,\nand this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for\nmowing for whole days together with the peasants.",
      "Ever since his\nbrother s arrival, he had been in doubt whether to mow or not.",
      "He was\nloath to leave his brother alone all day long, and he was afraid his\nbrother would laugh at him about it.",
      "But as he drove into the meadow,\nand recalled the sensations of mowing, he came near deciding that he\nwould go mowing.",
      "After the irritating discussion with his brother, he\npondered over this intention again.",
      "I must have physical exercise, or my temper ll certainly be ruined, \nhe thought, and he determined he would go mowing, however awkward he\nmight feel about it with his brother or the peasants.",
      "Towards evening Konstantin Levin went to his counting house, gave\ndirections as to the work to be done, and sent about the village to\nsummon the mowers for the morrow, to cut the hay in Kalinov meadow, the\nlargest and best of his grass lands.",
      "And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring it\nround tomorrow.",
      "I shall maybe do some mowing myself too,  he said,\ntrying not to be embarrassed.",
      "The bailiff smiled and said:  Yes, sir.",
      "At tea the same evening Levin said to his brother:\n\n I fancy the fine weather will last.",
      "Tomorrow I shall start mowing.",
      "I m so fond of that form of field labor,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I m awfully fond of it.",
      "I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and\ntomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch lifted his head, and looked with interest at his\nbrother.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "Just like one of the peasants, all day long?",
      "Yes, it s very pleasant,  said Levin.",
      "It s splendid as exercise, only you ll hardly be able to stand it, \nsaid Sergey Ivanovitch, without a shade of irony.",
      "I ve tried it.",
      "It s hard work at first, but you get into it.",
      "I dare\nsay I shall manage to keep it up.... \n\n Really!",
      "what an idea!",
      "But tell me, how do the peasants look at it?",
      "I\nsuppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master s being such a\nqueer fish?",
      "No, I don t think so; but it s so delightful, and at the same time\nsuch hard work, that one has no time to think about it.",
      "But how will you do about dining with them?",
      "To send you a bottle of\nLafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.",
      "No, I ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.",
      "Next morning Konstantin Levin got up earlier than usual, but he was\ndetained giving directions on the farm, and when he reached the mowing\ngrass the mowers were already at their second row.",
      "From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the\nmeadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps\nof coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had\nstarted cutting.",
      "Gradually, as he rode towards the meadow, the peasants came into sight,\nsome in coats, some in their shirts mowing, one behind another in a\nlong string, swinging their scythes differently.",
      "He counted forty-two\nof them.",
      "They were mowing slowly over the uneven, low-lying parts of the meadow,\nwhere there had been an old dam.",
      "Levin recognized some of his own men.",
      "Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to\nswing a scythe; there was a young fellow, Vaska, who had been a\ncoachman of Levin s, taking every row with a wide sweep.",
      "Here, too, was\nTit, Levin s preceptor in the art of mowing, a thin little peasant.",
      "He\nwas in front of all, and cut his wide row without bending, as though\nplaying with the scythe.",
      "Levin got off his mare, and fastening her up by the roadside went to\nmeet Tit, who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it to him.",
      "It s ready, sir; it s like a razor, cuts of itself,  said Tit, taking\noff his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe.",
      "Levin took the scythe, and began trying it.",
      "As they finished their\nrows, the mowers, hot and good-humored, came out into the road one\nafter another, and, laughing a little, greeted the master.",
      "They all\nstared at him, but no one made any remark, till a tall old man, with a\nwrinkled, beardless face, wearing a short sheepskin jacket, came out\ninto the road and accosted him.",
      "Look ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there s no letting it\ngo!",
      "he said, and Levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers.",
      "I ll try not to let it go,  he said, taking his stand behind Tit, and\nwaiting for the time to begin.",
      "Mind ee,  repeated the old man.",
      "Tit made room, and Levin started behind him.",
      "The grass was short close\nto the road, and Levin, who had not done any mowing for a long while,\nand was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him, cut badly for the\nfirst moments, though he swung his scythe vigorously.",
      "Behind him he\nheard voices:\n\n It s not set right; handle s too high; see how he has to stoop to it, \nsaid one.",
      "Press more on the heel,  said another.",
      "Never mind, he ll get on all right,  the old man resumed.",
      "He s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you ll tire yourself\nout....",
      "The master, sure, does his best for himself!",
      "But see the grass\nmissed out!",
      "For such work us fellows would catch it!",
      "The grass became softer, and Levin, listening without answering,\nfollowed Tit, trying to do the best he could.",
      "They moved a hundred\npaces.",
      "Tit kept moving on, without stopping, not showing the slightest\nweariness, but Levin was already beginning to be afraid he would not be\nable to keep it up: he was so tired.",
      "He felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his\nstrength, and was making up his mind to ask Tit to stop.",
      "But at that\nvery moment Tit stopped of his own accord, and stooping down picked up\nsome grass, rubbed his scythe, and began whetting it.",
      "Levin\nstraightened himself, and drawing a deep breath looked round.",
      "Behind\nhim came a peasant, and he too was evidently tired, for he stopped at\nonce without waiting to mow up to Levin, and began whetting his scythe.",
      "Tit sharpened his scythe and Levin s, and they went on.",
      "The next time\nit was just the same.",
      "Tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his\nscythe, not stopping nor showing signs of weariness.",
      "Levin followed\nhim, trying not to get left behind, and he found it harder and harder:\nthe moment came when he felt he had no strength left, but at that very\nmoment Tit stopped and whetted the scythes.",
      "So they mowed the first row.",
      "And this long row seemed particularly hard\nwork to Levin; but when the end was reached and Tit, shouldering his\nscythe, began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by\nhis heels in the cut grass, and Levin walked back in the same way over\nthe space he had cut, in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over\nhis face and fell in drops down his nose, and drenched his back as\nthough he had been soaked in water, he felt very happy.",
      "What delighted\nhim particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out.",
      "His pleasure was only disturbed by his row not being well cut.",
      "I will\nswing less with my arm and more with my whole body,  he thought,\ncomparing Tit s row, which looked as if it had been cut with a line,\nwith his own unevenly and irregularly lying grass.",
      "The first row, as Levin noticed, Tit had mowed specially quickly,\nprobably wishing to put his master to the test, and the row happened to\nbe a long one.",
      "The next rows were easier, but still Levin had to strain\nevery nerve not to drop behind the peasants.",
      "He thought of nothing, wished for nothing, but not to be left behind\nthe peasants, and to do his work as well as possible.",
      "He heard nothing\nbut the swish of scythes, and saw before him Tit s upright figure\nmowing away, the crescent-shaped curve of the cut grass, the grass and\nflower heads slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his\nscythe, and ahead of him the end of the row, where would come the rest.",
      "Suddenly, in the midst of his toil, without understanding what it was\nor whence it came, he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot,\nmoist shoulders.",
      "He glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the\nscythes.",
      "A heavy, lowering storm cloud had blown up, and big raindrops\nwere falling.",
      "Some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on;\nothers just like Levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders,\nenjoying the pleasant coolness of it.",
      "Another row, and yet another row, followed long rows and short rows,\nwith good grass and with poor grass.",
      "Levin lost all sense of time, and\ncould not have told whether it was late or early now.",
      "A change began to\ncome over his work, which gave him immense satisfaction.",
      "In the midst\nof his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was\ndoing, and it came all easy to him, and at those same moments his row\nwas almost as smooth and well cut as Tit s. But so soon as he\nrecollected what he was doing, and began trying to do better, he was at\nonce conscious of all the difficulty of his task, and the row was badly\nmown.",
      "On finishing yet another row he would have gone back to the top of the\nmeadow again to begin the next, but Tit stopped, and going up to the\nold man said something in a low voice to him.",
      "They both looked at the\nsun.",
      "What are they talking about, and why doesn t he go back?",
      "thought\nLevin, not guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four\nhours without stopping, and it was time for their lunch.",
      "Lunch, sir,  said the old man.",
      "Is it really time?",
      "That s right; lunch, then.",
      "Levin gave his scythe to Tit, and together with the peasants, who were\ncrossing the long stretch of mown grass, slightly sprinkled with rain,\nto get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.",
      "Only then he suddenly awoke to the fact that he had been wrong about\nthe weather and the rain was drenching his hay.",
      "The hay will be spoiled,  he said.",
      "Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you ll rake in fine\nweather!",
      "said the old man.",
      "Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch\nwas only just getting up.",
      "When he had drunk his coffee, Levin rode back\nagain to the mowing before Sergey Ivanovitch had had time to dress and\ncome down to the dining-room.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nAfter lunch Levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as\nbefore, but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely,\nand now invited him to be his neighbor, and a young peasant, who had\nonly been married in the autumn, and who was mowing this summer for the\nfirst time.",
      "The old man, holding himself erect, moved in front, with his feet\nturned out, taking long, regular strides, and with a precise and\nregular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging\none s arms in walking, as though it were in play, he laid down the\nhigh, even row of grass.",
      "It was as though it were not he but the sharp\nscythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass.",
      "Behind Levin came the lad Mishka.",
      "His pretty, boyish face, with a twist\nof fresh grass bound round his hair, was all working with effort; but\nwhenever anyone looked at him he smiled.",
      "He would clearly have died\nsooner than own it was hard work for him.",
      "Levin kept between them.",
      "In the very heat of the day the mowing did not\nseem such hard work to him.",
      "The perspiration with which he was drenched\ncooled him, while the sun, that burned his back, his head, and his\narms, bare to the elbow, gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor;\nand more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness, when\nit was possible not to think what one was doing.",
      "The scythe cut of\nitself.",
      "These were happy moments.",
      "Still more delightful were the\nmoments when they reached the stream where the rows ended, and the old\nman rubbed his scythe with the wet, thick grass, rinsed its blade in\nthe fresh water of the stream, ladled out a little in a tin dipper, and\noffered Levin a drink.",
      "What do you say to my home-brew, eh?",
      "Good, eh?",
      "said he, winking.",
      "And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water\nwith green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin\ndipper.",
      "And immediately after this came the delicious, slow saunter,\nwith his hand on the scythe, during which he could wipe away the\nstreaming sweat, take deep breaths of air, and look about at the long\nstring of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the\ncountry.",
      "The longer Levin mowed, the oftener he felt the moments of\nunconsciousness in which it seemed not his hands that swung the scythe,\nbut the scythe mowing of itself, a body full of life and consciousness\nof its own, and as though by magic, without thinking of it, the work\nturned out regular and well-finished of itself.",
      "These were the most\nblissful moments.",
      "It was only hard work when he had to break off the motion, which had\nbecome unconscious, and to think; when he had to mow round a hillock or\na tuft of sorrel.",
      "The old man did this easily.",
      "When a hillock came he\nchanged his action, and at one time with the heel, and at another with\nthe tip of his scythe, clipped the hillock round both sides with short\nstrokes.",
      "And while he did this he kept looking about and watching what\ncame into his view: at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or\noffered it to Levin, then he flung away a twig with the blade of the\nscythe, then he looked at a quail s nest, from which the bird flew just\nunder the scythe, or caught a snake that crossed his path, and lifting\nit on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to Levin and threw it\naway.",
      "For both Levin and the young peasant behind him, such changes of\nposition were difficult.",
      "Both of them, repeating over and over again\nthe same strained movement, were in a perfect frenzy of toil, and were\nincapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what\nwas before them.",
      "Levin did not notice how time was passing.",
      "If he had been asked how\nlong he had been working he would have said half an hour and it was\ngetting on for dinner time.",
      "As they were walking back over the cut\ngrass, the old man called Levin s attention to the little girls and\nboys who were coming from different directions, hardly visible through\nthe long grass, and along the road towards the mowers, carrying sacks\nof bread dragging at their little hands and pitchers of the sour\nrye-beer, with cloths wrapped round them.",
      "Look ee, the little emmets crawling!",
      "he said, pointing to them, and\nhe shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun.",
      "They mowed two\nmore rows; the old man stopped.",
      "Come, master, dinner time!",
      "he said briskly.",
      "And on reaching the\nstream the mowers moved off across the lines of cut grass towards their\npile of coats, where the children who had brought their dinners were\nsitting waiting for them.",
      "The peasants gathered into groups those\nfurther away under a cart, those nearer under a willow bush.",
      "Levin sat down by them; he felt disinclined to go away.",
      "All constraint with the master had disappeared long ago.",
      "The peasants\ngot ready for dinner.",
      "Some washed, the young lads bathed in the stream,\nothers made a place comfortable for a rest, untied their sacks of\nbread, and uncovered the pitchers of rye-beer.",
      "The old man crumbled up\nsome bread in a cup, stirred it with the handle of a spoon, poured\nwater on it from the dipper, broke up some more bread, and having\nseasoned it with salt, he turned to the east to say his prayer.",
      "Come, master, taste my sop,  said he, kneeling down before the cup.",
      "The sop was so good that Levin gave up the idea of going home.",
      "He dined\nwith the old man, and talked to him about his family affairs, taking\nthe keenest interest in them, and told him about his own affairs and\nall the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man.",
      "He felt\nmuch nearer to him than to his brother, and could not help smiling at\nthe affection he felt for this man.",
      "When the old man got up again, said\nhis prayer, and lay down under a bush, putting some grass under his\nhead for a pillow, Levin did the same, and in spite of the clinging\nflies that were so persistent in the sunshine, and the midges that\ntickled his hot face and body, he fell asleep at once and only waked\nwhen the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him.",
      "The old man had been awake a long while, and was sitting up whetting\nthe scythes of the younger lads.",
      "Levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place, everything was\nso changed.",
      "The immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was\nsparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance, with its lines of already\nsweet-smelling grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun.",
      "And the\nbushes about the river had been cut down, and the river itself, not\nvisible before, now gleaming like steel in its bends, and the moving,\nascending, peasants, and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of\nthe meadow, and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow all was\nperfectly new.",
      "Raising himself, Levin began considering how much had\nbeen cut and how much more could still be done that day.",
      "The work done was exceptionally much for forty-two men.",
      "They had cut\nthe whole of the big meadow, which had, in the years of serf labor,\ntaken thirty scythes two days to mow.",
      "Only the corners remained to do,\nwhere the rows were short.",
      "But Levin felt a longing to get as much\nmowing done that day as possible, and was vexed with the sun sinking so\nquickly in the sky.",
      "He felt no weariness; all he wanted was to get his\nwork done more and more quickly and as much done as possible.",
      "Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?",
      "what do you think?",
      "he said to the\nold man.",
      "As God wills, the sun s not high.",
      "A little vodka for the lads?",
      "At the afternoon rest, when they were sitting down again, and those who\nsmoked had lighted their pipes, the old man told the men that  Mashkin\nUpland s to be cut there ll be some vodka.",
      "Why not cut it?",
      "Come on, Tit!",
      "We ll look sharp!",
      "We can eat at night.",
      "Come on!",
      "cried voices, and eating up their bread, the mowers went back\nto work.",
      "Come, lads, keep it up!",
      "said Tit, and ran on ahead almost at a trot.",
      "Get along, get along!",
      "said the old man, hurrying after him and easily\novertaking him,  I ll mow you down, look out!",
      "And young and old mowed away, as though they were racing with one\nanother.",
      "But however fast they worked, they did not spoil the grass,\nand the rows were laid just as neatly and exactly.",
      "The little piece\nleft uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes.",
      "The last of the\nmowers were just ending their rows while the foremost snatched up their\ncoats onto their shoulders, and crossed the road towards Mashkin\nUpland.",
      "The sun was already sinking into the trees when they went with their\njingling dippers into the wooded ravine of Mashkin Upland.",
      "The grass\nwas up to their waists in the middle of the hollow, soft, tender, and\nfeathery, spotted here and there among the trees with wild\nheart s-ease.",
      "After a brief consultation whether to take the rows lengthwise or\ndiagonally Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired\npeasant, went on ahead.",
      "He went up to the top, turned back again and\nstarted mowing, and they all proceeded to form in line behind him,\ngoing downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of\nthe forest.",
      "The sun sank behind the forest.",
      "The dew was falling by now;\nthe mowers were in the sun only on the hillside, but below, where a\nmist was rising, and on the opposite side, they mowed into the fresh,\ndewy shade.",
      "The work went rapidly.",
      "The grass cut with a juicy sound,\nand was at once laid in high, fragrant rows.",
      "The mowers from all sides,\nbrought closer together in the short row, kept urging one another on to\nthe sound of jingling dippers and clanging scythes, and the hiss of the\nwhetstones sharpening them, and good-humored shouts.",
      "Levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man.",
      "The old\nman, who had put on his short sheepskin jacket, was just as\ngood-humored, jocose, and free in his movements.",
      "Among the trees they\nwere continually cutting with their scythes the so-called  birch\nmushrooms,  swollen fat in the succulent grass.",
      "But the old man bent\ndown every time he came across a mushroom, picked it up and put it in\nhis bosom.",
      "Another present for my old woman,  he said as he did so.",
      "Easy as it was to mow the wet, soft grass, it was hard work going up\nand down the steep sides of the ravine.",
      "But this did not trouble the\nold man.",
      "Swinging his scythe just as ever, and moving his feet in their\nbig, plaited shoes with firm, little steps, he climbed slowly up the\nsteep place, and though his breeches hanging out below his smock, and\nhis whole frame trembled with effort, he did not miss one blade of\ngrass or one mushroom on his way, and kept making jokes with the\npeasants and Levin.",
      "Levin walked after him and often thought he must\nfall, as he climbed with a scythe up a steep cliff where it would have\nbeen hard work to clamber without anything.",
      "But he climbed up and did\nwhat he had to do.",
      "He felt as though some external force were moving\nhim.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nMashkin Upland was mown, the last row finished, the peasants had put on\ntheir coats and were gaily trudging home.",
      "Levin got on his horse and,\nparting regretfully from the peasants, rode homewards.",
      "On the hillside\nhe looked back; he could not see them in the mist that had risen from\nthe valley; he could only hear rough, good-humored voices, laughter,\nand the sound of clanking scythes.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had long ago finished dinner, and was drinking iced\nlemon and water in his own room, looking through the reviews and papers\nwhich he had only just received by post, when Levin rushed into the\nroom, talking merrily, with his wet and matted hair sticking to his\nforehead, and his back and chest grimed and moist.",
      "We mowed the whole meadow!",
      "Oh, it is nice, delicious!",
      "And how have you\nbeen getting on?",
      "said Levin, completely forgetting the disagreeable\nconversation of the previous day.",
      "Mercy!",
      "what do you look like!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, for the first\nmoment looking round with some dissatisfaction.",
      "And the door, do shut\nthe door!",
      "he cried.",
      "You must have let in a dozen at least.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch could not endure flies, and in his own room he never\nopened the window except at night, and carefully kept the door shut.",
      "Not one, on my honor.",
      "But if I have, I ll catch them.",
      "You wouldn t\nbelieve what a pleasure it is!",
      "How have you spent the day?",
      "Very well.",
      "But have you really been mowing the whole day?",
      "I expect\nyou re as hungry as a wolf.",
      "Kouzma has got everything ready for you.",
      "No, I don t feel hungry even.",
      "I had something to eat there.",
      "But I ll\ngo and wash.",
      "Yes, go along, go along, and I ll come to you directly,  said Sergey\nIvanovitch, shaking his head as he looked at his brother.",
      "Go along,\nmake haste,  he added smiling, and gathering up his books, he prepared\nto go too.",
      "He, too, felt suddenly good-humored and disinclined to leave\nhis brother s side.",
      "But what did you do while it was raining?",
      "Rain?",
      "Why, there was scarcely a drop.",
      "I ll come directly.",
      "So you had a\nnice day too?",
      "That s first-rate.",
      "And Levin went off to change his\nclothes.",
      "Five minutes later the brothers met in the dining-room.",
      "Although it\nseemed to Levin that he was not hungry, and he sat down to dinner\nsimply so as not to hurt Kouzma s feelings, yet when he began to eat\nthe dinner struck him as extraordinarily good.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch\nwatched him with a smile.",
      "Oh, by the way, there s a letter for you,  said he.",
      "Kouzma, bring it\ndown, please.",
      "And mind you shut the doors.",
      "The letter was from Oblonsky.",
      "Levin read it aloud.",
      "Oblonsky wrote to\nhim from Petersburg:  I have had a letter from Dolly; she s at\nErgushovo, and everything seems going wrong there.",
      "Do ride over and see\nher, please; help her with advice; you know all about it.",
      "She will be\nso glad to see you.",
      "She s quite alone, poor thing.",
      "My mother-in-law and\nall of them are still abroad.",
      "That s capital!",
      "I will certainly ride over to her,  said Levin.",
      "Or\nwe ll go together.",
      "She s such a splendid woman, isn t she?",
      "They re not far from here, then?",
      "Twenty-five miles.",
      "Or perhaps it is thirty.",
      "But a capital road.",
      "Capital, we ll drive over.",
      "I shall be delighted,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, still smiling.",
      "The\nsight of his younger brother s appearance had immediately put him in a\ngood humor.",
      "Well, you have an appetite!",
      "he said, looking at his dark-red,\nsunburnt face and neck bent over the plate.",
      "Splendid!",
      "You can t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every\nsort of foolishness.",
      "I want to enrich medicine with a new word:\n_Arbeitskur_.",
      "Well, but you don t need it, I should fancy.",
      "No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.",
      "Yes, it ought to be tried.",
      "I had meant to come to the mowing to look\nat you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the\nforest.",
      "I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village,\nmet your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants  view of you.",
      "As\nfar as I can make out, they don t approve of this.",
      "She said:  It s not\na gentleman s work.",
      "Altogether, I fancy that in the people s ideas\nthere are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it,\n gentlemanly  lines of action.",
      "And they don t sanction the gentry s\nmoving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.",
      "Maybe so; but anyway it s a pleasure such as I have never known in my\nlife.",
      "And there s no harm in it, you know.",
      "Is there?",
      "answered Levin.",
      "I can t help it if they don t like it.",
      "Though I do believe it s all\nright.",
      "Eh?",
      "Altogether,  pursued Sergey Ivanovitch,  you re satisfied with your\nday?",
      "Quite satisfied.",
      "We cut the whole meadow.",
      "And such a splendid old man\nI made friends with there!",
      "You can t fancy how delightful he was!",
      "Well, so you re content with your day.",
      "And so am I.",
      "First, I solved\ntwo chess problems, and one a very pretty one a pawn opening.",
      "I ll show\nit you.",
      "And then I thought over our conversation yesterday.",
      "Eh!",
      "our conversation yesterday?",
      "said Levin, blissfully dropping his\neyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner, and\nabsolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation yesterday was\nabout.",
      "I think you are partly right.",
      "Our difference of opinion amounts to\nthis, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that\ninterest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain\ndegree of advancement.",
      "Possibly you are right too, that action founded\non material interest would be more desirable.",
      "You are altogether, as\nthe French say, too _primesauti re_ a nature; you must have intense,\nenergetic action, or nothing.",
      "Levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word, and\ndid not want to understand.",
      "He was only afraid his brother might ask\nhim some question which would make it evident he had not heard.",
      "So that s what I think it is, my dear boy,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,\ntouching him on the shoulder.",
      "Yes, of course.",
      "But, do you know?",
      "I won t stand up for my view, \nanswered Levin, with a guilty, childlike smile.",
      "Whatever was it I was\ndisputing about?",
      "he wondered.",
      "Of course, I m right, and he s right,\nand it s all first-rate.",
      "Only I must go round to the counting house and\nsee to things.",
      "He got up, stretching and smiling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch\nsmiled too.",
      "If you want to go out, let s go together,  he said, disinclined to be\nparted from his brother, who seemed positively breathing out freshness\nand energy.",
      "Come, we ll go to the counting house, if you have to go\nthere.",
      "Oh, heavens!",
      "shouted Levin, so loudly that Sergey Ivanovitch was\nquite frightened.",
      "What, what is the matter?",
      "How s Agafea Mihalovna s hand?",
      "said Levin, slapping himself on the\nhead.",
      "I d positively forgotten her even.",
      "It s much better.",
      "Well, anyway I ll run down to her.",
      "Before you ve time to get your hat\non, I ll be back.",
      "And he ran downstairs, clattering with his heels like a spring-rattle.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch had gone to Petersburg to perform the most natural\nand essential official duty so familiar to everyone in the government\nservice, though incomprehensible to outsiders that duty, but for which\none could hardly be in government service, of reminding the ministry of\nhis existence and having, for the due performance of this rite, taken\nall the available cash from home, was gaily and agreeably spending his\ndays at the races and in the summer villas.",
      "Meanwhile Dolly and the\nchildren had moved into the country, to cut down expenses as much as\npossible.",
      "She had gone to Ergushovo, the estate that had been her\ndowry, and the one where in spring the forest had been sold.",
      "It was\nnearly forty miles from Levin s Pokrovskoe.",
      "The big, old house at\nErgushovo had been pulled down long ago, and the old prince had had the\nlodge done up and built on to.",
      "Twenty years before, when Dolly was a\nchild, the lodge had been roomy and comfortable, though, like all\nlodges, it stood sideways to the entrance avenue, and faced the south.",
      "But by now this lodge was old and dilapidated.",
      "When Stepan Arkadyevitch\nhad gone down in the spring to sell the forest, Dolly had begged him to\nlook over the house and order what repairs might be needed.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch, like all unfaithful husbands indeed, was very solicitous\nfor his wife s comfort, and he had himself looked over the house, and\ngiven instructions about everything that he considered necessary.",
      "What\nhe considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with cretonne,\nto put up curtains, to weed the garden, to make a little bridge on the\npond, and to plant flowers.",
      "But he forgot many other essential matters,\nthe want of which greatly distressed Darya Alexandrovna later on.",
      "In spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch s efforts to be an attentive father and\nhusband, he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and\nchildren.",
      "He had bachelor tastes, and it was in accordance with them\nthat he shaped his life.",
      "On his return to Moscow he informed his wife\nwith pride that everything was ready, that the house would be a little\nparadise, and that he advised her most certainly to go.",
      "His wife s\nstaying away in the country was very agreeable to Stepan Arkadyevitch\nfrom every point of view: it did the children good, it decreased\nexpenses, and it left him more at liberty.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna regarded\nstaying in the country for the summer as essential for the children,\nespecially for the little girl, who had not succeeded in regaining her\nstrength after the scarlatina, and also as a means of escaping the\npetty humiliations, the little bills owing to the wood-merchant, the\nfishmonger, the shoemaker, which made her miserable.",
      "Besides this, she\nwas pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of\ngetting her sister Kitty to stay with her there.",
      "Kitty was to be back\nfrom abroad in the middle of the summer, and bathing had been\nprescribed for her.",
      "Kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to\nspend the summer with Dolly at Ergushovo, full of childish associations\nfor both of them.",
      "The first days of her existence in the country were very hard for\nDolly.",
      "She used to stay in the country as a child, and the impression\nshe had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the\nunpleasantness of the town, that life there, though not luxurious Dolly\ncould easily make up her mind to that was cheap and comfortable; that\nthere was plenty of everything, everything was cheap, everything could\nbe got, and children were happy.",
      "But now coming to the country as the\nhead of a family, she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she\nhad fancied.",
      "The day after their arrival there was a heavy fall of rain, and in the\nnight the water came through in the corridor and in the nursery, so\nthat the beds had to be carried into the drawing-room.",
      "There was no\nkitchen maid to be found; of the nine cows, it appeared from the words\nof the cowherd-woman that some were about to calve, others had just\ncalved, others were old, and others again hard-uddered; there was not\nbutter nor milk enough even for the children.",
      "There were no eggs.",
      "They\ncould get no fowls; old, purplish, stringy cocks were all they had for\nroasting and boiling.",
      "Impossible to get women to scrub the floors all\nwere potato-hoeing.",
      "Driving was out of the question, because one of the\nhorses was restive, and bolted in the shafts.",
      "There was no place where\nthey could bathe; the whole of the river-bank was trampled by the\ncattle and open to the road; even walks were impossible, for the cattle\nstrayed into the garden through a gap in the hedge, and there was one\nterrible bull, who bellowed, and therefore might be expected to gore\nsomebody.",
      "There were no proper cupboards for their clothes; what\ncupboards there were either would not close at all, or burst open\nwhenever anyone passed by them.",
      "There were no pots and pans; there was\nno copper in the washhouse, nor even an ironing-board in the maids \nroom.",
      "Finding instead of peace and rest all these, from her point of view,\nfearful calamities, Darya Alexandrovna was at first in despair.",
      "She\nexerted herself to the utmost, felt the hopelessness of the position,\nand was every instant suppressing the tears that started into her eyes.",
      "The bailiff, a retired quartermaster, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had\ntaken a fancy to and had appointed bailiff on account of his handsome\nand respectful appearance as a hall-porter, showed no sympathy for\nDarya Alexandrovna s woes.",
      "He said respectfully,  nothing can be done,\nthe peasants are such a wretched lot,  and did nothing to help her.",
      "The position seemed hopeless.",
      "But in the Oblonskys  household, as in\nall families indeed, there was one inconspicuous but most valuable and\nuseful person, Marya Philimonovna.",
      "She soothed her mistress, assured\nher that everything would _come round_ (it was her expression, and\nMatvey had borrowed it from her), and without fuss or hurry proceeded\nto set to work herself.",
      "She had immediately made friends with the\nbailiff s wife, and on the very first day she drank tea with her and\nthe bailiff under the acacias, and reviewed all the circumstances of\nthe position.",
      "Very soon Marya Philimonovna had established her club, so\nto say, under the acacias, and there it was, in this club, consisting\nof the bailiff s wife, the village elder, and the counting-house clerk,\nthat the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away, and in\na week s time everything actually had come round.",
      "The roof was mended,\na kitchen maid was found a crony of the village elder s hens were\nbought, the cows began giving milk, the garden hedge was stopped up\nwith stakes, the carpenter made a mangle, hooks were put in the\ncupboards, and they ceased to burst open spontaneously, and an\nironing-board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of\na chair to the chest of drawers, and there was a smell of flatirons in\nthe maids  room.",
      "Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,  said Marya\nPhilimonovna, pointing to the ironing-board.",
      "They even rigged up a\nbathing-shed of straw hurdles.",
      "Lily began to bathe, and Darya\nAlexandrovna began to realize, if only in part, her expectations, if\nnot of a peaceful, at least of a comfortable, life in the country.",
      "Peaceful with six children Darya Alexandrovna could not be.",
      "One would\nfall ill, another might easily become so, a third would be without\nsomething necessary, a fourth would show symptoms of a bad disposition,\nand so on.",
      "Rare indeed were the brief periods of peace.",
      "But these cares\nand anxieties were for Darya Alexandrovna the sole happiness possible.",
      "Had it not been for them, she would have been left alone to brood over\nher husband who did not love her.",
      "And besides, hard though it was for\nthe mother to bear the dread of illness, the illnesses themselves, and\nthe grief of seeing signs of evil propensities in her children the\nchildren themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her\nsufferings.",
      "Those joys were so small that they passed unnoticed, like\ngold in sand, and at bad moments she could see nothing but the pain,\nnothing but sand; but there were good moments too when she saw nothing\nbut the joy, nothing but gold.",
      "Now in the solitude of the country, she began to be more and more\nfrequently aware of those joys.",
      "Often, looking at them, she would make\nevery possible effort to persuade herself that she was mistaken, that\nshe as a mother was partial to her children.",
      "All the same, she could\nnot help saying to herself that she had charming children, all six of\nthem in different ways, but a set of children such as is not often to\nbe met with, and she was happy in them, and proud of them.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nTowards the end of May, when everything had been more or less\nsatisfactorily arranged, she received her husband s answer to her\ncomplaints of the disorganized state of things in the country.",
      "He wrote\nbegging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before,\nand promised to come down at the first chance.",
      "This chance did not\npresent itself, and till the beginning of June Darya Alexandrovna\nstayed alone in the country.",
      "On the Sunday in St. Peter s week Darya Alexandrovna drove to mass for\nall her children to take the sacrament.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna in her\nintimate, philosophical talks with her sister, her mother, and her\nfriends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in\nregard to religion.",
      "She had a strange religion of transmigration of\nsouls all her own, in which she had firm faith, troubling herself\nlittle about the dogmas of the Church.",
      "But in her family she was strict\nin carrying out all that was required by the Church and not merely in\norder to set an example, but with all her heart in it.",
      "The fact that\nthe children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried\nher extremely, and with the full approval and sympathy of Marya\nPhilimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer.",
      "For several days before, Darya Alexandrovna was busily deliberating on\nhow to dress all the children.",
      "Frocks were made or altered and washed,\nseams and flounces were let out, buttons were sewn on, and ribbons got\nready.",
      "One dress, Tanya s, which the English governess had undertaken,\ncost Darya Alexandrovna much loss of temper.",
      "The English governess in\naltering it had made the seams in the wrong place, had taken up the\nsleeves too much, and altogether spoilt the dress.",
      "It was so narrow on\nTanya s shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her.",
      "But Marya\nPhilimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets, and adding a\nlittle shoulder-cape.",
      "The dress was set right, but there was nearly a\nquarrel with the English governess.",
      "On the morning, however, all was\nhappily arranged, and towards ten o clock the time at which they had\nasked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their\nnew dresses, with beaming faces, stood on the step before the carriage\nwaiting for their mother.",
      "To the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed,\nthanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff s\nhorse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her own\nattire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had done her hair, and dressed with care and\nexcitement.",
      "In the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look\npretty and be admired.",
      "Later on, as she got older, dress became more\nand more distasteful to her.",
      "She saw that she was losing her good\nlooks.",
      "But now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again.",
      "Now she did not dress for her own sake, not for the sake of her own\nbeauty, but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she\nmight not spoil the general effect.",
      "And looking at herself for the last\ntime in the looking-glass she was satisfied with herself.",
      "She looked\nnice.",
      "Not nice as she would have wished to look nice in old days at a\nball, but nice for the object which she now had in view.",
      "In the church there was no one but the peasants, the servants and their\nwomen-folk.",
      "But Darya Alexandrovna saw, or fancied she saw, the\nsensation produced by her children and her.",
      "The children were not only\nbeautiful to look at in their smart little dresses, but they were\ncharming in the way they behaved.",
      "Aliosha, it is true, did not stand\nquite correctly; he kept turning round, trying to look at his little\njacket from behind; but all the same he was wonderfully sweet.",
      "Tanya\nbehaved like a grown-up person, and looked after the little ones.",
      "And\nthe smallest, Lily, was bewitching in her na ve astonishment at\neverything, and it was difficult not to smile when, after taking the\nsacrament, she said in English,  Please, some more.",
      "On the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened,\nand were very sedate.",
      "Everything went happily at home too; but at lunch Grisha began\nwhistling, and, what was worse, was disobedient to the English\ngoverness, and was forbidden to have any tart.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna would\nnot have let things go so far on such a day had she been present; but\nshe had to support the English governess s authority, and she upheld\nher decision that Grisha should have no tart.",
      "This rather spoiled the\ngeneral good humor.",
      "Grisha cried, declaring that Nikolinka had whistled\ntoo, and he was not punished, and that he wasn t crying for the tart he\ndidn t care but at being unjustly treated.",
      "This was really too tragic,\nand Darya Alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the English\ngoverness to forgive Grisha, and she went to speak to her.",
      "But on the\nway, as she passed the drawing-room, she beheld a scene, filling her\nheart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes, and she\nforgave the delinquent herself.",
      "The culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the\ndrawing-room; beside him was standing Tanya with a plate.",
      "On the\npretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls, she had asked the\ngoverness s permission to take her share of tart to the nursery, and\nhad taken it instead to her brother.",
      "While still weeping over the\ninjustice of his punishment, he was eating the tart, and kept saying\nthrough his sobs,  Eat yourself; let s eat it together ... together.",
      "Tanya had at first been under the influence of her pity for Grisha,\nthen of a sense of her noble action, and tears were standing in her\neyes too; but she did not refuse, and ate her share.",
      "On catching sight of their mother they were dismayed, but, looking into\nher face, they saw they were not doing wrong.",
      "They burst out laughing,\nand, with their mouths full of tart, they began wiping their smiling\nlips with their hands, and smearing their radiant faces all over with\ntears and jam.",
      "Mercy!",
      "Your new white frock!",
      "Tanya!",
      "Grisha!",
      "said their mother, trying\nto save the frock, but with tears in her eyes, smiling a blissful,\nrapturous smile.",
      "The new frocks were taken off, and orders were given for the little\ngirls to have their blouses put on, and the boys their old jackets, and\nthe wagonette to be harnessed; with Brownie, to the bailiff s\nannoyance, again in the shafts, to drive out for mushroom picking and\nbathing.",
      "A roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery, and never\nceased till they had set off for the bathing-place.",
      "They gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms; even Lily found a birch\nmushroom.",
      "It had always happened before that Miss Hoole found them and\npointed them out to her; but this time she found a big one quite of\nherself, and there was a general scream of delight,  Lily has found a\nmushroom!",
      "Then they reached the river, put the horses under the birch trees, and\nwent to the bathing-place.",
      "The coachman, Terenty, fastened the horses,\nwho kept whisking away the flies, to a tree, and, treading down the\ngrass, lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag, while the\nnever-ceasing shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him\nfrom the bathing-place.",
      "Though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain\ntheir wild pranks, though it was difficult too to keep in one s head\nand not mix up all the stockings, little breeches, and shoes for the\ndifferent legs, and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and\nbuttons, Darya Alexandrovna, who had always liked bathing herself, and\nbelieved it to be very good for the children, enjoyed nothing so much\nas bathing with all the children.",
      "To go over all those fat little legs,\npulling on their stockings, to take in her arms and dip those little\nnaked bodies, and to hear their screams of delight and alarm, to see\nthe breathless faces with wide-open, scared, and happy eyes of all her\nsplashing cherubs, was a great pleasure to her.",
      "When half the children had been dressed, some peasant women in holiday\ndress, out picking herbs, came up to the bathing-shed and stopped\nshyly.",
      "Marya Philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and\na shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them, and Darya\nAlexandrovna began to talk to the women.",
      "At first they laughed behind\ntheir hands and did not understand her questions, but soon they grew\nbolder and began to talk, winning Darya Alexandrovna s heart at once by\nthe genuine admiration of the children that they showed.",
      "My, what a beauty!",
      "as white as sugar,  said one, admiring Tanitchka,\nand shaking her head;  but thin....",
      "Yes, she has been ill. \n\n And so they ve been bathing you too,  said another to the baby.",
      "No; he s only three months old,  answered Darya Alexandrovna with\npride.",
      "You don t say so!",
      "And have you any children?",
      "I ve had four; I ve two living a boy and a girl.",
      "I weaned her last\ncarnival.",
      "How old is she?",
      "Why, two years old.",
      "Why did you nurse her so long?",
      "It s our custom; for three fasts.... \n\nAnd the conversation became most interesting to Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "What sort of time did she have?",
      "What was the matter with the boy?",
      "Where\nwas her husband?",
      "Did it often happen?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women, so\ninteresting to her was their conversation, so completely identical were\nall their interests.",
      "What pleased her most of all was that she saw\nclearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so\nmany children, and such fine ones.",
      "The peasant women even made Darya\nAlexandrovna laugh, and offended the English governess, because she was\nthe cause of the laughter she did not understand.",
      "One of the younger\nwomen kept staring at the Englishwoman, who was dressing after all the\nrest, and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain\nfrom the remark,  My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and she ll\nnever have done!",
      "she said, and they all went off into roars.",
      "Chapter 9\n\nOn the drive home, as Darya Alexandrovna, with all her children round\nher, their heads still wet from their bath, and a kerchief tied over\nher own head, was getting near the house, the coachman said,  There s\nsome gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, I do believe.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she\nrecognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin\nwalking to meet them.",
      "She was glad to see him at any time, but at this\nmoment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory.",
      "No\none was better able to appreciate her grandeur than Levin.",
      "Seeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of\nhis daydream of family life.",
      "You re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Ah, how glad I am to see you!",
      "she said, holding out her hand to him.",
      "Glad to see me, but you didn t let me know.",
      "My brother s staying with\nme.",
      "I got a note from Stiva that you were here.",
      "From Stiva?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna asked with surprise.",
      "Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow\nme to be of use to you,  said Levin, and as he said it he became\nsuddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence\nby the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling\nthem.",
      "He was embarrassed through a sense that Darya Alexandrovna would\nbe annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights\nhave come from her own husband.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna certainly did not\nlike this little way of Stepan Arkadyevitch s of foisting his domestic\nduties on others.",
      "And she was at once aware that Levin was aware of\nthis.",
      "It was just for this fineness of perception, for this delicacy,\nthat Darya Alexandrovna liked Levin.",
      "I know, of course,  said Levin,  that that simply means that you would\nlike to see me, and I m exceedingly glad.",
      "Though I can fancy that, used\nto town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and\nif there s anything wanted, I m altogether at your disposal.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "said Dolly.",
      "At first things were rather uncomfortable, but\nnow we ve settled everything capitally thanks to my old nurse,  she\nsaid, indicating Marya Philimonovna, who, seeing that they were\nspeaking of her, smiled brightly and cordially to Levin.",
      "She knew him,\nand knew that he would be a good match for her young lady, and was very\nkeen to see the matter settled.",
      "Won t you get in, sir, we ll make room this side!",
      "she said to him.",
      "No, I ll walk.",
      "Children, who d like to race the horses with me?",
      "The\nchildren knew Levin very little, and could not remember when they had\nseen him, but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange\nfeeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience\ntowards hypocritical, grown-up people, and for which they are so often\nand miserably punished.",
      "Hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the\ncleverest and most penetrating man, but the least wide-awake of\nchildren recognizes it, and is revolted by it, however ingeniously it\nmay be disguised.",
      "Whatever faults Levin had, there was not a trace of\nhypocrisy in him, and so the children showed him the same friendliness\nthat they saw in their mother s face.",
      "On his invitation, the two elder\nones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would\nhave done with their nurse or Miss Hoole or their mother.",
      "Lily, too,\nbegan begging to go to him, and her mother handed her to him; he sat\nher on his shoulder and ran along with her.",
      "Don t be afraid, don t be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!",
      "he said,\nsmiling good-humoredly to the mother;  there s no chance of my hurting\nor dropping her.",
      "And, looking at his strong, agile, assiduously careful and needlessly\nwary movements, the mother felt her mind at rest, and smiled gaily and\napprovingly as she watched him.",
      "Here, in the country, with children, and with Darya Alexandrovna, with\nwhom he was in sympathy, Levin was in a mood not infrequent with him,\nof childlike light-heartedness that she particularly liked in him.",
      "As\nhe ran with the children, he taught them gymnastic feats, set Miss\nHoole laughing with his queer English accent, and talked to Darya\nAlexandrovna of his pursuits in the country.",
      "After dinner, Darya Alexandrovna, sitting alone with him on the\nbalcony, began to speak of Kitty.",
      "You know, Kitty s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with\nme.",
      "Really,  he said, flushing, and at once, to change the conversation,\nhe said:  Then I ll send you two cows, shall I?",
      "If you insist on a bill\nyou shall pay me five roubles a month; but it s really too bad of you.",
      "No, thank you.",
      "We can manage very well now.",
      "Oh, well, then, I ll have a look at your cows, and if you ll allow me,\nI ll give directions about their food.",
      "Everything depends on their\nfood.",
      "And Levin, to turn the conversation, explained to Darya Alexandrovna\nthe theory of cow-keeping, based on the principle that the cow is\nsimply a machine for the transformation of food into milk, and so on.",
      "He talked of this, and passionately longed to hear more of Kitty, and,\nat the same time, was afraid of hearing it.",
      "He dreaded the breaking up\nof the inward peace he had gained with such effort.",
      "Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to\nlook after it?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna responded, without interest.",
      "She had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged,\nthanks to Marya Philimonovna, that she was disinclined to make any\nchange in them; besides, she had no faith in Levin s knowledge of\nfarming.",
      "General principles, as to the cow being a machine for the\nproduction of milk, she looked on with suspicion.",
      "It seemed to her that\nsuch principles could only be a hindrance in farm management.",
      "It all\nseemed to her a far simpler matter: all that was needed, as Marya\nPhilimonovna had explained, was to give Brindle and Whitebreast more\nfood and drink, and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to\nthe laundry maid s cow.",
      "That was clear.",
      "But general propositions as to\nfeeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure.",
      "And, what was\nmost important, she wanted to talk about Kitty.",
      "Chapter 10\n\n Kitty writes to me that there s nothing she longs for so much as quiet\nand solitude,  Dolly said after the silence that had followed.",
      "And how is she better?",
      "Levin asked in agitation.",
      "Thank God, she s quite well again.",
      "I never believed her lungs were\naffected.",
      "Oh, I m very glad!",
      "said Levin, and Dolly fancied she saw something\ntouching, helpless, in his face as he said this and looked silently\ninto her face.",
      "Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  said Darya Alexandrovna,\nsmiling her kindly and rather mocking smile,  why is it you are angry\nwith Kitty?",
      "I?",
      "I m not angry with her,  said Levin.",
      "Yes, you are angry.",
      "Why was it you did not come to see us nor them\nwhen you were in Moscow?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna,  he said, blushing up to the roots of his hair,  I\nwonder really that with your kind heart you don t feel this.",
      "How it is\nyou feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when you know.... \n\n What do I know?",
      "You know I made an offer and that I was refused,  said Levin, and all\nthe tenderness he had been feeling for Kitty a minute before was\nreplaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered.",
      "What makes you suppose I know?",
      "Because everybody knows it.... \n\n That s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though I had\nguessed it was so.",
      "Well, now you know it.",
      "All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully\nmiserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it.",
      "And if she\nwould not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else.",
      "But what did pass between you?",
      "Tell me.",
      "I have told you.",
      "When was it?",
      "When I was at their house the last time.",
      "Do you know that,  said Darya Alexandrovna,  I am awfully, awfully\nsorry for her.",
      "You suffer only from pride.... \n\n Perhaps so,  said Levin,  but.... \n\nShe interrupted him.",
      "But she, poor girl ...",
      "I am awfully, awfully sorry for her.",
      "Now I see\nit all.",
      "Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,  he said, getting up.",
      "Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.",
      "No, wait a minute,  she said, clutching him by the sleeve.",
      "Wait a\nminute, sit down.",
      "Please, please, don t let us talk of this,  he said, sitting down, and\nat the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he\nhad believed to be buried.",
      "If I did not like you,  she said, and tears came into her eyes;  if I\ndid not know you, as I do know you....",
      "The feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more, rose up and\ntook possession of Levin s heart.",
      "Yes, I understand it all now,  said Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "You can t\nunderstand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it s\nalways clear whom you love.",
      "But a girl s in a position of suspense,\nwith all a woman s or maiden s modesty, a girl who sees you men from\nafar, who takes everything on trust, a girl may have, and often has,\nsuch a feeling that she cannot tell what to say.",
      "Yes, if the heart does not speak.... \n\n No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views about\na girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, you\nwait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are\nsure you love her, you make an offer.... \n\n Well, that s not quite it.",
      "Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance\nhas completely turned between the two you are choosing from.",
      "But a girl\nis not asked.",
      "She is expected to make her choice, and yet she cannot\nchoose, she can only answer  yes  or  no.",
      "Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,  thought Levin, and the dead\nthing that had come to life within him died again, and only weighed on\nhis heart and set it aching.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna,  he said,  that s how one chooses a new dress or\nsome purchase or other, not love.",
      "The choice has been made, and so much\nthe better.... And there can be no repeating it.",
      "Ah, pride, pride!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, as though despising him\nfor the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling\nwhich only women know.",
      "At the time when you made Kitty an offer she\nwas just in a position in which she could not answer.",
      "She was in doubt.",
      "Doubt between you and Vronsky.",
      "Him she was seeing every day, and you\nshe had not seen for a long while.",
      "Supposing she had been older ...",
      "I,\nfor instance, in her place could have felt no doubt.",
      "I always disliked\nhim, and so it has turned out.",
      "Levin recalled Kitty s answer.",
      "She had said:  _No, that cannot be_.... \n\n Darya Alexandrovna,  he said dryly,  I appreciate your confidence in\nme; I believe you are making a mistake.",
      "But whether I am right or\nwrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina\nAlexandrovna out of the question for me, you understand, utterly out of\nthe question.",
      "I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my\nsister, whom I love as I love my own children.",
      "I don t say she cared\nfor you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves\nnothing.",
      "I don t know!",
      "said Levin, jumping up.",
      "If you only knew how you are\nhurting me.",
      "It s just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were\nto say to you: He would have been like this and like that, and he might\nhave lived, and how happy you would have been in him.",
      "But he s dead,\ndead, dead!...",
      "How absurd you are!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, looking with mournful\ntenderness at Levin s excitement.",
      "Yes, I see it all more and more\nclearly,  she went on musingly.",
      "So you won t come to see us, then,\nwhen Kitty s here?",
      "No, I shan t come.",
      "Of course I won t avoid meeting Katerina\nAlexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the annoyance\nof my presence.",
      "You are very, very absurd,  repeated Darya Alexandrovna, looking with\ntenderness into his face.",
      "Very well then, let it be as though we had\nnot spoken of this.",
      "What have you come for, Tanya?",
      "she said in French\nto the little girl who had come in.",
      "Where s my spade, mamma?",
      "I speak French, and you must too.",
      "The little girl tried to say it in French, but could not remember the\nFrench for spade; the mother prompted her, and then told her in French\nwhere to look for the spade.",
      "And this made a disagreeable impression on\nLevin.",
      "Everything in Darya Alexandrovna s house and children struck him now as\nby no means so charming as a little while before.",
      "And what does she\ntalk French with the children for?",
      "he thought;  how unnatural and\nfalse it is!",
      "And the children feel it so: Learning French and\nunlearning sincerity,  he thought to himself, unaware that Darya\nAlexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already, and yet,\neven at the cost of some loss of sincerity, believed it necessary to\nteach her children French in that way.",
      "But why are you going?",
      "Do stay a little.",
      "Levin stayed to tea; but his good-humor had vanished, and he felt ill\nat ease.",
      "After tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in,\nand, when he came back, he found Darya Alexandrovna greatly disturbed,\nwith a troubled face, and tears in her eyes.",
      "While Levin had been\noutside, an incident had occurred which had utterly shattered all the\nhappiness she had been feeling that day, and her pride in her children.",
      "Grisha and Tanya had been fighting over a ball.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna,\nhearing a scream in the nursery, ran in and saw a terrible sight.",
      "Tanya\nwas pulling Grisha s hair, while he, with a face hideous with rage, was\nbeating her with his fists wherever he could get at her.",
      "Something\nsnapped in Darya Alexandrovna s heart when she saw this.",
      "It was as if\ndarkness had swooped down upon her life; she felt that these children\nof hers, that she was so proud of, were not merely most ordinary, but\npositively bad, ill-bred children, with coarse, brutal\npropensities wicked children.",
      "She could not talk or think of anything else, and she could not speak\nto Levin of her misery.",
      "Levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her, saying that it\nshowed nothing bad, that all children fight; but, even as he said it,\nhe was thinking in his heart:  No, I won t be artificial and talk\nFrench with my children; but my children won t be like that.",
      "All one\nhas to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and\nthey ll be delightful.",
      "No, my children won t be like that.",
      "He said good-bye and drove away, and she did not try to keep him.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nIn the middle of July the elder of the village on Levin s sister s\nestate, about fifteen miles from Pokrovskoe, came to Levin to report on\nhow things were going there and on the hay.",
      "The chief source of income\non his sister s estate was from the riverside meadows.",
      "In former years\nthe hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the three\nacres.",
      "When Levin took over the management of the estate, he thought on\nexamining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the\nprice at twenty-five roubles the three acres.",
      "The peasants would not\ngive that price, and, as Levin suspected, kept off other purchasers.",
      "Then Levin had driven over himself, and arranged to have the grass cut,\npartly by hired labor, partly at a payment of a certain proportion of\nthe crop.",
      "His own peasants put every hindrance they could in the way of\nthis new arrangement, but it was carried out, and the first year the\nmeadows had yielded a profit almost double.",
      "The previous year which was\nthe third year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the\narrangement, and the hay had been cut on the same system.",
      "This year the\npeasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop, and the\nvillage elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut, and\nthat, fearing rain, they had invited the counting-house clerk over, had\ndivided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks\nas the owner s share.",
      "From the vague answers to his question how much\nhay had been cut on the principal meadow, from the hurry of the village\nelder who had made the division, not asking leave, from the whole tone\nof the peasant, Levin perceived that there was something wrong in the\ndivision of the hay, and made up his mind to drive over himself to look\ninto the matter.",
      "Arriving for dinner at the village, and leaving his horse at the\ncottage of an old friend of his, the husband of his brother s\nwet-nurse, Levin went to see the old man in his bee-house, wanting to\nfind out from him the truth about the hay.",
      "Parmenitch, a talkative,\ncomely old man, gave Levin a very warm welcome, showed him all he was\ndoing, told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year;\nbut gave vague and unwilling answers to Levin s inquiries about the\nmowing.",
      "This confirmed Levin still more in his suspicions.",
      "He went to\nthe hay fields and examined the stacks.",
      "The haystacks could not\npossibly contain fifty wagon-loads each, and to convict the peasants\nLevin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up\ndirectly, to lift one stack, and carry it into the barn.",
      "There turned\nout to be only thirty-two loads in the stack.",
      "In spite of the village\nelder s assertions about the compressibility of hay, and its having\nsettled down in the stacks, and his swearing that everything had been\ndone in the fear of God, Levin stuck to his point that the hay had been\ndivided without his orders, and that, therefore, he would not accept\nthat hay as fifty loads to a stack.",
      "After a prolonged dispute the\nmatter was decided by the peasants taking these eleven stacks,\nreckoning them as fifty loads each.",
      "The arguments and the division of\nthe haycocks lasted the whole afternoon.",
      "When the last of the hay had\nbeen divided, Levin, intrusting the superintendence of the rest to the\ncounting-house clerk, sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of\nwillow, and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants.",
      "In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a\nbright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being\nrapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble.",
      "After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows\nthere were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks.",
      "To the left, carts\nwere rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared, and one\nafter another the haycocks vanished, flung up in huge forkfuls, and in\ntheir place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging\nover the horses  hind-quarters.",
      "What weather for haying!",
      "What hay it ll be!",
      "said an old man,\nsquatting down beside Levin.",
      "It s tea, not hay!",
      "It s like scattering\ngrain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!",
      "he added, pointing to the\ngrowing haycocks.",
      "Since dinner time they ve carried a good half of\nit.",
      "The last load, eh?",
      "he shouted to a young peasant, who drove by,\nstanding in the front of an empty cart, shaking the cord reins.",
      "The last, dad!",
      "the lad shouted back, pulling in the horse, and,\nsmiling, he looked round at a bright, rosy-cheeked peasant girl who sat\nin the cart smiling too, and drove on.",
      "Who s that?",
      "Your son?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "My baby,  said the old man with a tender smile.",
      "What a fine fellow!",
      "The lad s all right.",
      "Married already?",
      "Yes, it s two years last St. Philip s day.",
      "Any children?",
      "Children indeed!",
      "Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe\nhimself, and bashful too,  answered the old man.",
      "Well, the hay!",
      "It s\nas fragrant as tea!",
      "he repeated, wishing to change the subject.",
      "Levin looked more attentively at Ivan Parmenov and his wife.",
      "They were\nloading a haycock onto the cart not far from him.",
      "Ivan Parmenov was\nstanding on the cart, taking, laying in place, and stamping down the\nhuge bundles of hay, which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to\nhim, at first in armfuls, and then on the pitchfork.",
      "The young wife\nworked easily, merrily, and dexterously.",
      "The close-packed hay did not\nonce break away off her fork.",
      "First she gathered it together, stuck the\nfork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole\nweight of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the\nred belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the\nwhite smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung\nthe bundle of hay high onto the cart.",
      "Ivan, obviously doing his best to\nsave her every minute of unnecessary labor, made haste, opening his\narms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the cart.",
      "As she raked together\nwhat was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that\nhad fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had\ndropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the\nsun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load.",
      "Ivan directed her how\nto fasten the cord to the cross-piece, and at something she said he\nlaughed aloud.",
      "In the expressions of both faces was to be seen\nvigorous, young, freshly awakened love.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nThe load was tied on.",
      "Ivan jumped down and took the quiet, sleek horse\nby the bridle.",
      "The young wife flung the rake up on the load, and with a\nbold step, swinging her arms, she went to join the women, who were\nforming a ring for the haymakers  dance.",
      "Ivan drove off to the road and\nfell into line with the other loaded carts.",
      "The peasant women, with\ntheir rakes on their shoulders, gay with bright flowers, and chattering\nwith ringing, merry voices, walked behind the hay cart.",
      "One wild\nuntrained female voice broke into a song, and sang it alone through a\nverse, and then the same verse was taken up and repeated by half a\nhundred strong healthy voices, of all sorts, coarse and fine, singing\nin unison.",
      "The women, all singing, began to come close to Levin, and he felt as\nthough a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment.",
      "The storm swooped down, enveloped him and the haycock on which he was\nlying, and the other haycocks, and the wagon-loads, and the whole\nmeadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the\nmeasures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and\nclapping.",
      "Levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness; he longed\nto take part in the expression of this joy of life.",
      "But he could do\nnothing, and had to lie and look on and listen.",
      "When the peasants, with\ntheir singing, had vanished out of sight and hearing, a weary feeling\nof despondency at his own isolation, his physical inactivity, his\nalienation from this world, came over Levin.",
      "Some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with\nhim over the hay, some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had\ntried to cheat him, those very peasants had greeted him good-humoredly,\nand evidently had not, were incapable of having any feeling of rancor\nagainst him, any regret, any recollection even of having tried to\ndeceive him.",
      "All that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor.",
      "God\ngave the day, God gave the strength.",
      "And the day and the strength were\nconsecrated to labor, and that labor was its own reward.",
      "For whom the\nlabor?",
      "What would be its fruits?",
      "These were idle considerations beside\nthe point.",
      "Often Levin had admired this life, often he had a sense of envy of the\nmen who led this life; but today for the first time, especially under\nthe influence of what he had seen in the attitude of Ivan Parmenov to\nhis young wife, the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that\nit was in his power to exchange the dreary, artificial, idle, and\nindividualistic life he was leading for this laborious, pure, and\nsocially delightful life.",
      "The old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home; the\npeople had all separated.",
      "Those who lived near had gone home, while\nthose who came from far were gathered into a group for supper, and to\nspend the night in the meadow.",
      "Levin, unobserved by the peasants, still\nlay on the haycock, and still looked on and listened and mused.",
      "The\npeasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all\nthe short summer night.",
      "At first there was the sound of merry talk and\nlaughing all together over the supper, then singing again and laughter.",
      "All the long day of toil had left no trace in them but lightness of\nheart.",
      "Before the early dawn all was hushed.",
      "Nothing was to be heard\nbut the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh, and\nthe horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before the\nmorning.",
      "Rousing himself, Levin got up from the haycock, and looking at\nthe stars, he saw that the night was over.",
      "Well, what am I going to do?",
      "How am I to set about it?",
      "he said to\nhimself, trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he\nhad passed through in that brief night.",
      "All the thoughts and feelings\nhe had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought.",
      "One\nwas the renunciation of his old life, of his utterly useless education.",
      "This renunciation gave him satisfaction, and was easy and simple.",
      "Another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he\nlonged to live now.",
      "The simplicity, the purity, the sanity of this life\nhe felt clearly, and he was convinced he would find in it the content,\nthe peace, and the dignity, of the lack of which he was so miserably\nconscious.",
      "But a third series of ideas turned upon the question how to\neffect this transition from the old life to the new.",
      "And there nothing\ntook clear shape for him.",
      "Have a wife?",
      "Have work and the necessity of\nwork?",
      "Leave Pokrovskoe?",
      "Buy land?",
      "Become a member of a peasant\ncommunity?",
      "Marry a peasant girl?",
      "How am I to set about it?",
      "he asked\nhimself again, and could not find an answer.",
      "I haven t slept all\nnight, though, and I can t think it out clearly,  he said to himself.",
      "I ll work it out later.",
      "One thing s certain, this night has decided my\nfate.",
      "All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing, \nhe told himself.",
      "It s all ever so much simpler and better.... \n\n How beautiful!",
      "he thought, looking at the strange, as it were,\nmother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his\nhead in the middle of the sky.",
      "How exquisite it all is in this\nexquisite night!",
      "And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?",
      "Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it only two\nwhite streaks.",
      "Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed!",
      "He went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad towards the\nvillage.",
      "A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen.",
      "The\ngloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn, the full triumph\nof light over darkness.",
      "Shrinking from the cold, Levin walked rapidly, looking at the ground.",
      "What s that?",
      "Someone coming,  he thought, catching the tinkle of\nbells, and lifting his head.",
      "Forty paces from him a carriage with four\nhorses harnessed abreast was driving towards him along the grassy road\non which he was walking.",
      "The shaft-horses were tilted against the\nshafts by the ruts, but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held\nthe shaft over the ruts, so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of\nthe road.",
      "This was all Levin noticed, and without wondering who it could be, he\ngazed absently at the coach.",
      "In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window,\nevidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the\nribbons of a white cap.",
      "With a face full of light and thought, full of\na subtle, complex inner life, that was remote from Levin, she was\ngazing beyond him at the glow of the sunrise.",
      "At the very instant when this apparition was vanishing, the truthful\neyes glanced at him.",
      "She recognized him, and her face lighted up with\nwondering delight.",
      "He could not be mistaken.",
      "There were no other eyes like those in the\nworld.",
      "There was only one creature in the world that could concentrate\nfor him all the brightness and meaning of life.",
      "It was she.",
      "It was\nKitty.",
      "He understood that she was driving to Ergushovo from the railway\nstation.",
      "And everything that had been stirring Levin during that\nsleepless night, all the resolutions he had made, all vanished at once.",
      "He recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl.",
      "There\nonly, in the carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the\nroad, and was rapidly disappearing, there only could he find the\nsolution of the riddle of his life, which had weighed so agonizingly\nupon him of late.",
      "She did not look out again.",
      "The sound of the carriage-springs was no\nlonger audible, the bells could scarcely be heard.",
      "The barking of dogs\nshowed the carriage had reached the village, and all that was left was\nthe empty fields all round, the village in front, and he himself\nisolated and apart from it all, wandering lonely along the deserted\nhighroad.",
      "He glanced at the sky, expecting to find there the cloud shell he had\nbeen admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of\nthat night.",
      "There was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell.",
      "There, in the remote heights above, a mysterious change had been\naccomplished.",
      "There was no trace of shell, and there was stretched over\nfully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets.",
      "The\nsky had grown blue and bright; and with the same softness, but with the\nsame remoteness, it met his questioning gaze.",
      "No,  he said to himself,  however good that life of simplicity and\ntoil may be, I cannot go back to it.",
      "I love _her_.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nNone but those who were most intimate with Alexey Alexandrovitch knew\nthat, while on the surface the coldest and most reasonable of men, he\nhad one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch could not hear or see a child or woman crying\nwithout being moved.",
      "The sight of tears threw him into a state of\nnervous agitation, and he utterly lost all power of reflection.",
      "The\nchief secretary of his department and his private secretary were aware\nof this, and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account\nto give way to tears, if they did not want to ruin their chances.",
      "He\nwill get angry, and will not listen to you,  they used to say.",
      "And as a\nfact, in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in Alexey\nAlexandrovitch by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger.",
      "I can do nothing.",
      "Kindly leave the room!",
      "he would commonly cry in\nsuch cases.",
      "When returning from the races Anna had informed him of her relations\nwith Vronsky, and immediately afterwards had burst into tears, hiding\nher face in her hands, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for all the fury aroused\nin him against her, was aware at the same time of a rush of that\nemotional disturbance always produced in him by tears.",
      "Conscious of it,\nand conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would\nbe out of keeping with the position, he tried to suppress every\nmanifestation of life in himself, and so neither stirred nor looked at\nher.",
      "This was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike\nrigidity in his face which had so impressed Anna.",
      "When they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage,\nand making an effort to master himself, took leave of her with his\nusual urbanity, and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing; he\nsaid that tomorrow he would let her know his decision.",
      "His wife s words, confirming his worst suspicions, had sent a cruel\npang to the heart of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "That pang was intensified\nby the strange feeling of physical pity for her set up by her tears.",
      "But when he was all alone in the carriage Alexey Alexandrovitch, to his\nsurprise and delight, felt complete relief both from this pity and from\nthe doubts and agonies of jealousy.",
      "He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after\nsuffering long from toothache.",
      "After a fearful agony and a sense of\nsomething huge, bigger than the head itself, being torn out of his jaw,\nthe sufferer, hardly able to believe in his own good luck, feels all at\nonce that what has so long poisoned his existence and enchained his\nattention, exists no longer, and that he can live and think again, and\ntake interest in other things besides his tooth.",
      "This feeling Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was experiencing.",
      "The agony had been strange and\nterrible, but now it was over; he felt that he could live again and\nthink of something other than his wife.",
      "No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman.",
      "I always knew it and\nalways saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her,  he said\nto himself.",
      "And it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it:\nhe recalled incidents of their past life, in which he had never seen\nanything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had\nalways been a corrupt woman.",
      "I made a mistake in linking my life to\nhers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be\nunhappy.",
      "It s not I that am to blame,  he told himself,  but she.",
      "But I\nhave nothing to do with her.",
      "She does not exist for me.... \n\nEverything relating to her and her son, towards whom his sentiments\nwere as much changed as towards her, ceased to interest him.",
      "The only\nthing that interested him now was the question of in what way he could\nbest, with most propriety and comfort for himself, and thus with most\njustice, extricate himself from the mud with which she had spattered\nhim in her fall, and then proceed along his path of active, honorable,\nand useful existence.",
      "I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has\ncommitted a crime.",
      "I have only to find the best way out of the\ndifficult position in which she has placed me.",
      "And I shall find it,  he\nsaid to himself, frowning more and more.",
      "I m not the first nor the\nlast.",
      "And to say nothing of historical instances dating from the  Fair\nHelen  of Menelaus, recently revived in the memory of all, a whole list\nof contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the\nhighest society rose before Alexey Alexandrovitch s imagination.",
      "Daryalov, Poltavsky, Prince Karibanov, Count Paskudin, Dram....",
      "Yes,\neven Dram, such an honest, capable fellow ... Semyonov, Tchagin,\nSigonin,  Alexey Alexandrovitch remembered.",
      "Admitting that a certain\nquite irrational _ridicule_ falls to the lot of these men, yet I never\nsaw anything but a misfortune in it, and always felt sympathy for it, \nAlexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, though indeed this was not the\nfact, and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind, but\nthe more frequently he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives\nbetraying their husbands, the more highly he had thought of himself.",
      "It is a misfortune which may befall anyone.",
      "And this misfortune has\nbefallen me.",
      "The only thing to be done is to make the best of the\nposition.",
      "And he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had\nbeen in the same position that he was in.",
      "Daryalov fought a duel....",
      "The duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch in his youth, just because he was physically a coward,\nand was himself well aware of the fact.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch could not\nwithout horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself, and\nhad never made use of any weapon in his life.",
      "This horror had in his\nyouth set him pondering on dueling, and picturing himself in a position\nin which he would have to expose his life to danger.",
      "Having attained\nsuccess and an established position in the world, he had long ago\nforgotten this feeling; but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted\nitself, and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that\nAlexey Alexandrovitch spent a long while thinking over the question of\ndueling in all its aspects, and hugging the idea of a duel, though he\nwas fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances\nfight one.",
      "There s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it s not the same\nin England) that very many and among these were those whose opinion\nAlexey Alexandrovitch particularly valued look favorably on the duel;\nbut what result is attained by it?",
      "Suppose I call him out,  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch went on to himself, and vividly picturing the night he\nwould spend after the challenge, and the pistol aimed at him, he\nshuddered, and knew that he never would do it suppose I call him out.",
      "Suppose I am taught,  he went on musing,  to shoot; I press the\ntrigger,  he said to himself, closing his eyes,  and it turns out I\nhave killed him,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself, and he shook\nhis head as though to dispel such silly ideas.",
      "What sense is there in\nmurdering a man in order to define one s relation to a guilty wife and\nson?",
      "I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with\nher.",
      "But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur I should\nbe killed or wounded.",
      "I, the innocent person, should be the\nvictim killed or wounded.",
      "It s even more senseless.",
      "But apart from\nthat, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side.",
      "Don t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to\nfight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by\nRussia, to be exposed to danger?",
      "Knowing perfectly well beforehand that\nthe matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my\nsimply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.",
      "That would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving\nmyself and others.",
      "A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of\nme.",
      "My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for\nthe uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.",
      "Official duties, which\nhad always been of great consequence in Alexey Alexandrovitch s eyes,\nseemed of special importance to his mind at this moment.",
      "Considering\nand rejecting the duel, Alexey Alexandrovitch turned to divorce another\nsolution selected by several of the husbands he remembered.",
      "Passing in\nmental review all the instances he knew of divorces (there were plenty\nof them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar),\nAlexey Alexandrovitch could not find a single example in which the\nobject of divorce was that which he had in view.",
      "In all these instances\nthe husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife, and the\nvery party which, being in fault, had not the right to contract a fresh\nmarriage, had formed counterfeit, pseudo-matrimonial ties with a\nself-styled husband.",
      "In his own case, Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that a\nlegal divorce, that is to say, one in which only the guilty wife would\nbe repudiated, was impossible of attainment.",
      "He saw that the complex\nconditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his wife s\nguilt, required by the law, out of the question; he saw that a certain\nrefinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought\nforward, even if he had them, and that to bring forward such proofs\nwould damage him in the public estimation more than it would her.",
      "An attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal, which\nwould be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on\nhis high position in society.",
      "His chief object, to define the position\nwith the least amount of disturbance possible, would not be attained by\ndivorce either.",
      "Moreover, in the event of divorce, or even of an\nattempt to obtain a divorce, it was obvious that the wife broke off all\nrelations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover.",
      "And in\nspite of the complete, as he supposed, contempt and indifference he now\nfelt for his wife, at the bottom of his heart Alexey Alexandrovitch\nstill had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her\nfree to throw in her lot with Vronsky, so that her crime would be to\nher advantage.",
      "The mere notion of this so exasperated Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with\ninward agony, and got up and changed his place in the carriage, and for\na long while after, he sat with scowling brows, wrapping his numbed and\nbony legs in the fleecy rug.",
      "Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov,\nPaskudin, and that good fellow Dram that is, separate from one s wife, \nhe went on thinking, when he had regained his composure.",
      "But this step\ntoo presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce, and\nwhat was more, a separation, quite as much as a regular divorce, flung\nhis wife into the arms of Vronsky.",
      "No, it s out of the question, out\nof the question!",
      "he said again, twisting his rug about him again.",
      "I\ncannot be unhappy, but neither she nor he ought to be happy.",
      "The feeling of jealousy, which had tortured him during the period of\nuncertainty, had passed away at the instant when the tooth had been\nwith agony extracted by his wife s words.",
      "But that feeling had been\nreplaced by another, the desire, not merely that she should not be\ntriumphant, but that she should get due punishment for her crime.",
      "He\ndid not acknowledge this feeling, but at the bottom of his heart he\nlonged for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind his\nhonor.",
      "And going once again over the conditions inseparable from a\nduel, a divorce, a separation, and once again rejecting them, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch felt convinced that there was only one solution, to keep\nher with him, concealing what had happened from the world, and using\nevery measure in his power to break off the intrigue, and still\nmore though this he did not admit to himself to punish her.",
      "I must\ninform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position\nin which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be worse\nfor both sides than an external _status quo_, and that such I agree to\nretain, on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes,\nthat is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her lover.",
      "When this\ndecision had been finally adopted, another weighty consideration\noccurred to Alexey Alexandrovitch in support of it.",
      "By such a course\nonly shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,  he\ntold himself.",
      "In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty\nwife, but giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as\nthe task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her\nreformation and salvation.",
      "Though Alexey Alexandrovitch was perfectly aware that he could not\nexert any moral influence over his wife, that such an attempt at\nreformation could lead to nothing but falsity; though in passing\nthrough these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking\nguidance in religion, yet now, when his conclusion corresponded, as it\nseemed to him, with the requirements of religion, this religious\nsanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction, and to some\nextent restored his peace of mind.",
      "He was pleased to think that, even\nin such an important crisis in life, no one would be able to say that\nhe had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion\nwhose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and\nindifference.",
      "As he pondered over subsequent developments, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch did not see, indeed, why his relations with his wife\nshould not remain practically the same as before.",
      "No doubt, she could\nnever regain his esteem, but there was not, and there could not be, any\nsort of reason that his existence should be troubled, and that he\nshould suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife.",
      "Yes, time will\npass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be\nreestablished,  Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself;  so far\nreestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the\ncontinuity of my life.",
      "She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to\nblame, and so I cannot be unhappy.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nAs he neared Petersburg, Alexey Alexandrovitch not only adhered\nentirely to his decision, but was even composing in his head the letter\nhe would write to his wife.",
      "Going into the porter s room, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch glanced at the letters and papers brought from his\noffice, and directed that they should be brought to him in his study.",
      "The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,  he said in answer\nto the porter, with a certain pleasure, indicative of his agreeable\nframe of mind, emphasizing the words,  see no one.",
      "In his study Alexey Alexandrovitch walked up and down twice, and\nstopped at an immense writing-table, on which six candles had already\nbeen lighted by the valet who had preceded him.",
      "He cracked his knuckles\nand sat down, sorting out his writing appurtenances.",
      "Putting his elbows\non the table, he bent his head on one side, thought a minute, and began\nto write, without pausing for a second.",
      "He wrote without using any form\nof address to her, and wrote in French, making use of the plural\n _vous_,  which has not the same note of coldness as the corresponding\nRussian form.",
      "At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to\ncommunicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that\nconversation.",
      "Having carefully considered everything, I am writing now\nwith the object of fulfilling that promise.",
      "My decision is as follows.",
      "Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified\nin breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power.",
      "The\nfamily cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of\none of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has\ndone in the past.",
      "This is essential for me, for you, and for our son.",
      "I\nam fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has\ncalled forth the present letter, and that you will cooperate with me in\neradicating the cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past.",
      "In\nthe contrary event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son.",
      "All this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview.",
      "As\nthe season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to\nPetersburg as quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday.",
      "All\nnecessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here.",
      "I beg you\nto note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this\nrequest.",
      "A. Karenin\n\n _P.S._ I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.",
      "He read the letter through and felt pleased with it, and especially\nthat he had remembered to enclose money: there was not a harsh word,\nnot a reproach in it, nor was there undue indulgence.",
      "Most of all, it\nwas a golden bridge for return.",
      "Folding the letter and smoothing it\nwith a massive ivory knife, and putting it in an envelope with the\nmoney, he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him\nto use the well arranged appointments of his writing-table.",
      "Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow\nat the summer villa,  he said, getting up.",
      "Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be brought to the study, and\nplaying with the massive paper-knife, he moved to his easy chair, near\nwhich there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the French work on\nEgyptian hieroglyphics that he had begun.",
      "Over the easy chair there\nhung in a gold frame an oval portrait of Anna, a fine painting by a\ncelebrated artist.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at it.",
      "The\nunfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him.",
      "Insufferably\ninsolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch s eyes\nof the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter,\nthe black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered\nwith rings.",
      "After looking at the portrait for a minute, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch shuddered so that his lips quivered and he uttered the\nsound  brrr,  and turned away.",
      "He made haste to sit down in his easy\nchair and opened the book.",
      "He tried to read, but he could not revive\nthe very vivid interest he had felt before in Egyptian hieroglyphics.",
      "He looked at the book and thought of something else.",
      "He thought not of\nhis wife, but of a complication that had arisen in his official life,\nwhich at the time constituted the chief interest of it.",
      "He felt that he\nhad penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair,\nand that he had originated a leading idea he could say it without\nself-flattery calculated to clear up the whole business, to strengthen\nhim in his official career, to discomfit his enemies, and thereby to be\nof the greatest benefit to the government.",
      "Directly the servant had set\nthe tea and left the room, Alexey Alexandrovitch got up and went to the\nwriting-table.",
      "Moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of\npapers, with a scarcely perceptible smile of self-satisfaction, he took\na pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report\nrelating to the present complication.",
      "The complication was of this\nnature: Alexey Alexandrovitch s characteristic quality as a politician,\nthat special individual qualification that every rising functionary\npossesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his\nreserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career,\nwas his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his\ndirect contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his\neconomy.",
      "It happened that the famous Commission of the 2nd of June had\nset on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the Zaraisky\nprovince, which fell under Alexey Alexandrovitch s department, and was\na glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was aware of the truth of this.",
      "The irrigation of these\nlands in the Zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of\nAlexey Alexandrovitch s predecessor.",
      "And vast sums of money had\nactually been spent and were still being spent on this business, and\nutterly unproductively, and the whole business could obviously lead to\nnothing whatever.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had perceived this at once on\nentering office, and would have liked to lay hands on the Board of\nIrrigation.",
      "But at first, when he did not yet feel secure in his\nposition, he knew it would affect too many interests, and would be\ninjudicious.",
      "Later on he had been engrossed in other questions, and had\nsimply forgotten the Board of Irrigation.",
      "It went of itself, like all\nsuch boards, by the mere force of inertia.",
      "(Many people gained their\nlivelihood by the Board of Irrigation, especially one highly\nconscientious and musical family: all the daughters played on stringed\ninstruments, and Alexey Alexandrovitch knew the family and had stood\ngodfather to one of the elder daughters.)",
      "The raising of this question\nby a hostile department was in Alexey Alexandrovitch s opinion a\ndishonorable proceeding, seeing that in every department there were\nthings similar and worse, which no one inquired into, for well-known\nreasons of official etiquette.",
      "However, now that the glove had been\nthrown down to him, he had boldly picked it up and demanded the\nappointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the\nworking of the Board of Irrigation of the lands in the Zaraisky\nprovince.",
      "But in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either.",
      "He demanded the appointment of another special commission to inquire\ninto the question of the Native Tribes Organization Committee.",
      "The\nquestion of the Native Tribes had been brought up incidentally in the\nCommission of the 2nd of June, and had been pressed forward actively by\nAlexey Alexandrovitch as one admitting of no delay on account of the\ndeplorable condition of the native tribes.",
      "In the commission this\nquestion had been a ground of contention between several departments.",
      "The department hostile to Alexey Alexandrovitch proved that the\ncondition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing, that the\nproposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity, and that\nif there were anything wrong, it arose mainly from the failure on the\npart of Alexey Alexandrovitch s department to carry out the measures\nprescribed by law.",
      "Now Alexey Alexandrovitch intended to demand: First,\nthat a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to\ninvestigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot; secondly,\nif it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually\nwas such as it appeared to be from the official documents in the hands\nof the committee, that another new scientific commission should be\nappointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes\nfrom the (1) political, (2) administrative, (3) economic, (4)\nethnographical, (5) material, and (6) religious points of view;\nthirdly, that evidence should be required from the rival department of\nthe measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that\ndepartment for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native\ntribes were now placed; and fourthly and finally, that that department\nexplain why it had, as appeared from the evidence before the committee,\nfrom No.",
      "17,015 and 18,038, from December 5, 1863, and June 7, 1864,\nacted in direct contravention of the intent of the law T... Act 18, and\nthe note to Act 36.",
      "A flash of eagerness suffused the face of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for\nhis own benefit.",
      "Having filled a sheet of paper, he got up, rang, and\nsent a note to the chief secretary of his department to look up certain\nnecessary facts for him.",
      "Getting up and walking about the room, he\nglanced again at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.",
      "After reading a little more of the book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, and\nrenewing his interest in it, Alexey Alexandrovitch went to bed at\neleven o clock, and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his\nwife, he saw it now in by no means such a gloomy light.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nThough Anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted Vronsky\nwhen he told her their position was impossible, at the bottom of her\nheart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable, and she\nlonged with her whole soul to change it.",
      "On the way home from the races\nshe had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement, and in\nspite of the agony she had suffered in doing so, she was glad of it.",
      "After her husband had left her, she told herself that she was glad,\nthat now everything was made clear, and at least there would be no more\nlying and deception.",
      "It seemed to her beyond doubt that her position\nwas now made clear forever.",
      "It might be bad, this new position, but it\nwould be clear; there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it.",
      "The pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words\nwould be rewarded now by everything being made clear, she thought.",
      "That\nevening she saw Vronsky, but she did not tell him of what had passed\nbetween her and her husband, though, to make the position definite, it\nwas necessary to tell him.",
      "When she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was\nwhat she had said to her husband, and those words seemed to her so\nawful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought\nherself to utter those strange, coarse words, and could not imagine\nwhat would come of it.",
      "But the words were spoken, and Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had gone away without saying anything.",
      "I saw Vronsky\nand did not tell him.",
      "At the very instant he was going away I would\nhave turned him back and told him, but I changed my mind, because it\nwas strange that I had not told him the first minute.",
      "Why was it I\nwanted to tell him and did not tell him?",
      "And in answer to this\nquestion a burning blush of shame spread over her face.",
      "She knew what\nhad kept her from it, she knew that she had been ashamed.",
      "Her position,\nwhich had seemed to her simplified the night before, suddenly struck\nher now as not only not simple, but as absolutely hopeless.",
      "She felt\nterrified at the disgrace, of which she had not ever thought before.",
      "Directly she thought of what her husband would do, the most terrible\nideas came to her mind.",
      "She had a vision of being turned out of the\nhouse, of her shame being proclaimed to all the world.",
      "She asked\nherself where she should go when she was turned out of the house, and\nshe could not find an answer.",
      "When she thought of Vronsky, it seemed to her that he did not love her,\nthat he was already beginning to be tired of her, that she could not\noffer herself to him, and she felt bitter against him for it.",
      "It seemed\nto her that the words that she had spoken to her husband, and had\ncontinually repeated in her imagination, she had said to everyone, and\neveryone had heard them.",
      "She could not bring herself to look those of\nher own household in the face.",
      "She could not bring herself to call her\nmaid, and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess.",
      "The maid, who had been listening at her door for a long while, came\ninto her room of her own accord.",
      "Anna glanced inquiringly into her\nface, and blushed with a scared look.",
      "The maid begged her pardon for\ncoming in, saying that she had fancied the bell rang.",
      "She brought her\nclothes and a note.",
      "The note was from Betsy.",
      "Betsy reminded her that\nLiza Merkalova and Baroness Shtoltz were coming to play croquet with\nher that morning with their adorers, Kaluzhsky and old Stremov.",
      "Come,\nif only as a study in morals.",
      "I shall expect you,  she finished.",
      "Anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh.",
      "Nothing, I need nothing,  she said to Annushka, who was rearranging\nthe bottles and brushes on the dressing table.",
      "You can go.",
      "I ll dress\nat once and come down.",
      "I need nothing.",
      "Annushka went out, but Anna did not begin dressing, and sat in the same\nposition, her head and hands hanging listlessly, and every now and then\nshe shivered all over, seemed as though she would make some gesture,\nutter some word, and sank back into lifelessness again.",
      "She repeated\ncontinually,  My God!",
      "my God!",
      "But neither  God  nor  my  had any\nmeaning to her.",
      "The idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion\nwas as remote from her as seeking help from Alexey Alexandrovitch\nhimself, although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she\nhad been brought up.",
      "She knew that the support of religion was possible\nonly upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole\nmeaning of life.",
      "She was not simply miserable, she began to feel alarm\nat the new spiritual condition, never experienced before, in which she\nfound herself.",
      "She felt as though everything were beginning to be\ndouble in her soul, just as objects sometimes appear double to\nover-tired eyes.",
      "She hardly knew at times what it was she feared, and\nwhat she hoped for.",
      "Whether she feared or desired what had happened, or\nwhat was going to happen, and exactly what she longed for, she could\nnot have said.",
      "Ah, what am I doing!",
      "she said to herself, feeling a sudden thrill of\npain in both sides of her head.",
      "When she came to herself, she saw that\nshe was holding her hair in both hands, each side of her temples, and\npulling it.",
      "She jumped up, and began walking about.",
      "The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting,  said\nAnnushka, coming back again and finding Anna in the same position.",
      "Seryozha?",
      "What about Seryozha?",
      "Anna asked, with sudden eagerness,\nrecollecting her son s existence for the first time that morning.",
      "He s been naughty, I think,  answered Annushka with a smile.",
      "In what way?",
      "Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room.",
      "I think he\nslipped in and ate one of them on the sly.",
      "The recollection of her son suddenly roused Anna from the helpless\ncondition in which she found herself.",
      "She recalled the partly sincere,\nthough greatly exaggerated, r le of the mother living for her child,\nwhich she had taken up of late years, and she felt with joy that in the\nplight in which she found herself she had a support, quite apart from\nher relation to her husband or to Vronsky.",
      "This support was her son.",
      "In\nwhatever position she might be placed, she could not lose her son.",
      "Her\nhusband might put her to shame and turn her out, Vronsky might grow\ncold to her and go on living his own life apart (she thought of him\nagain with bitterness and reproach); she could not leave her son.",
      "She\nhad an aim in life.",
      "And she must act; act to secure this relation to\nher son, so that he might not be taken from her.",
      "Quickly indeed, as\nquickly as possible, she must take action before he was taken from her.",
      "She must take her son and go away.",
      "Here was the one thing she had to do\nnow.",
      "She needed consolation.",
      "She must be calm, and get out of this\ninsufferable position.",
      "The thought of immediate action binding her to\nher son, of going away somewhere with him, gave her this consolation.",
      "She dressed quickly, went downstairs, and with resolute steps walked\ninto the drawing-room, where she found, as usual, waiting for her, the\ncoffee, Seryozha, and his governess.",
      "Seryozha, all in white, with his\nback and head bent, was standing at a table under a looking-glass, and\nwith an expression of intense concentration which she knew well, and in\nwhich he resembled his father, he was doing something to the flowers he\ncarried.",
      "The governess had a particularly severe expression.",
      "Seryozha screamed\nshrilly, as he often did,  Ah, mamma!",
      "and stopped, hesitating whether\nto go to greet his mother and put down the flowers, or to finish making\nthe wreath and go with the flowers.",
      "The governess, after saying good-morning, began a long and detailed\naccount of Seryozha s naughtiness, but Anna did not hear her; she was\nconsidering whether she would take her with her or not.",
      "No, I won t\ntake her,  she decided.",
      "I ll go alone with my child.",
      "Yes, it s very wrong,  said Anna, and taking her son by the shoulder\nshe looked at him, not severely, but with a timid glance that\nbewildered and delighted the boy, and she kissed him.",
      "Leave him to\nme,  she said to the astonished governess, and not letting go of her\nson, she sat down at the table, where coffee was set ready for her.",
      "Mamma!",
      "I ...",
      "I ... didn t....  he said, trying to make out from her\nexpression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches.",
      "Seryozha,  she said, as soon as the governess had left the room,  that\nwas wrong, but you ll never do it again, will you?...",
      "You love me?",
      "She felt that the tears were coming into her eyes.",
      "Can I help loving\nhim?",
      "she said to herself, looking deeply into his scared and at the\nsame time delighted eyes.",
      "And can he ever join his father in punishing\nme?",
      "Is it possible he will not feel for me?",
      "Tears were already flowing\ndown her face, and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out\non to the terrace.",
      "After the thunder showers of the last few days, cold, bright weather\nhad set in.",
      "The air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through\nthe freshly washed leaves.",
      "She shivered, both from the cold and from the inward horror which had\nclutched her with fresh force in the open air.",
      "Run along, run along to Mariette,  she said to Seryozha, who had\nfollowed her out, and she began walking up and down on the straw\nmatting of the terrace.",
      "Can it be that they won t forgive me, won t\nunderstand how it all couldn t be helped?",
      "she said to herself.",
      "Standing still, and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in\nthe wind, with their freshly washed, brightly shining leaves in the\ncold sunshine, she knew that they would not forgive her, that everyone\nand everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky, that\ngreen.",
      "And again she felt that everything was split in two in her soul.",
      "I mustn t, mustn t think,  she said to herself.",
      "I must get ready.",
      "To\ngo where?",
      "When?",
      "Whom to take with me?",
      "Yes, to Moscow by the evening\ntrain.",
      "Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things.",
      "But\nfirst I must write to them both.",
      "She went quickly indoors into her\nboudoir, sat down at the table, and wrote to her husband: After what\nhas happened, I cannot remain any longer in your house.",
      "I am going\naway, and taking my son with me.",
      "I don t know the law, and so I don t\nknow with which of the parents the son should remain; but I take him\nwith me because I cannot live without him.",
      "Be generous, leave him to\nme.",
      "Up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally, but the appeal to his\ngenerosity, a quality she did not recognize in him, and the necessity\nof winding up the letter with something touching, pulled her up.",
      "Of my\nfault and my remorse I cannot speak, because.... \n\nShe stopped again, finding no connection in her ideas.",
      "No,  she said\nto herself,  there s no need of anything,  and tearing up the letter,\nshe wrote it again, leaving out the allusion to generosity, and sealed\nit up.",
      "Another letter had to be written to Vronsky.",
      "I have told my husband, \nshe wrote, and she sat a long while unable to write more.",
      "It was so\ncoarse, so unfeminine.",
      "And what more am I to write to him?",
      "she said\nto herself.",
      "Again a flush of shame spread over her face; she recalled\nhis composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear\nthe sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits.",
      "No need of\nanything,  she said to herself, and closing her blotting-case she went\nupstairs, told the governess and the servants that she was going that\nday to Moscow, and at once set to work to pack up her things.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nAll the rooms of the summer villa were full of porters, gardeners, and\nfootmen going to and fro carrying out things.",
      "Cupboards and chests were\nopen; twice they had sent to the shop for cord; pieces of newspaper\nwere tossing about on the floor.",
      "Two trunks, some bags and strapped-up\nrugs, had been carried down into the hall.",
      "The carriage and two hired\ncabs were waiting at the steps.",
      "Anna, forgetting her inward agitation\nin the work of packing, was standing at a table in her boudoir, packing\nher traveling bag, when Annushka called her attention to the rattle of\nsome carriage driving up.",
      "Anna looked out of the window and saw Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s courier on the steps, ringing at the front door bell.",
      "Run and find out what it is,  she said, and with a calm sense of being\nprepared for anything, she sat down in a low chair, folding her hands\non her knees.",
      "A footman brought in a thick packet directed in Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s hand.",
      "The courier has orders to wait for an answer,  he said.",
      "Very well,  she said, and as soon as he had left the room she tore\nopen the letter with trembling fingers.",
      "A roll of unfolded notes done\nup in a wrapper fell out of it.",
      "She disengaged the letter and began\nreading it at the end.",
      "Preparations shall be made for your arrival\nhere ...",
      "I attach particular significance to compliance....  she read.",
      "She ran on, then back, read it all through, and once more read the\nletter all through again from the beginning.",
      "When she had finished, she\nfelt that she was cold all over, and that a fearful calamity, such as\nshe had not expected, had burst upon her.",
      "In the morning she had regretted that she had spoken to her husband,\nand wished for nothing so much as that those words could be unspoken.",
      "And here this letter regarded them as unspoken, and gave her what she\nhad wanted.",
      "But now this letter seemed to her more awful than anything\nshe had been able to conceive.",
      "He s right!",
      "she said;  of course, he s always right; he s a\nChristian, he s generous!",
      "Yes, vile, base creature!",
      "And no one\nunderstands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can t explain it.",
      "They say he s so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever;\nbut they don t see what I ve seen.",
      "They don t know how he has crushed\nmy life for eight years, crushed everything that was living in me he\nhas not once even thought that I m a live woman who must have love.",
      "They don t know how at every step he s humiliated me, and been just as\npleased with himself.",
      "Haven t I striven, striven with all my strength,\nto find something to give meaning to my life?",
      "Haven t I struggled to\nlove him, to love my son when I could not love my husband?",
      "But the time\ncame when I knew that I couldn t cheat myself any longer, that I was\nalive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I must\nlove and live.",
      "And now what does he do?",
      "If he d killed me, if he d\nkilled him, I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven\nanything; but, no, he.... How was it I didn t guess what he would do?",
      "He s doing just what s characteristic of his mean character.",
      "He ll keep\nhimself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he ll drive still lower to\nworse ruin yet.... \n\nShe recalled the words from the letter.",
      "You can conjecture what awaits\nyou and your son....   That s a threat to take away my child, and most\nlikely by their stupid law he can.",
      "But I know very well why he says it.",
      "He doesn t believe even in my love for my child, or he despises it\n(just as he always used to ridicule it).",
      "He despises that feeling in\nme, but he knows that I won t abandon my child, that I can t abandon my\nchild, that there could be no life for me without my child, even with\nhim whom I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from\nhim, I should be acting like the most infamous, basest of women.",
      "He\nknows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.",
      "She recalled another sentence in the letter.",
      "Our life must go on as it\nhas done in the past....   That life was miserable enough in the old\ndays; it has been awful of late.",
      "What will it be now?",
      "And he knows all\nthat; he knows that I can t repent that I breathe, that I love; he\nknows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to\ngo on torturing me.",
      "I know him; I know that he s at home and is happy\nin deceit, like a fish swimming in the water.",
      "No, I won t give him that\nhappiness.",
      "I ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants\nto catch me, come what may.",
      "Anything s better than lying and deceit.",
      "But how?",
      "My God!",
      "my God!",
      "Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...",
      "No; I will break through it, I will break through it!",
      "she cried,\njumping up and keeping back her tears.",
      "And she went to the\nwriting-table to write him another letter.",
      "But at the bottom of her\nheart she felt that she was not strong enough to break through\nanything, that she was not strong enough to get out of her old\nposition, however false and dishonorable it might be.",
      "She sat down at the writing-table, but instead of writing she clasped\nher hands on the table, and, laying her head on them, burst into tears,\nwith sobs and heaving breast like a child crying.",
      "She was weeping that\nher dream of her position being made clear and definite had been\nannihilated forever.",
      "She knew beforehand that everything would go on in\nthe old way, and far worse, indeed, than in the old way.",
      "She felt that\nthe position in the world that she enjoyed, and that had seemed to her\nof so little consequence in the morning, that this position was\nprecious to her, that she would not have the strength to exchange it\nfor the shameful position of a woman who has abandoned husband and\nchild to join her lover; that however much she might struggle, she\ncould not be stronger than herself.",
      "She would never know freedom in\nlove, but would remain forever a guilty wife, with the menace of\ndetection hanging over her at every instant; deceiving her husband for\nthe sake of a shameful connection with a man living apart and away from\nher, whose life she could never share.",
      "She knew that this was how it\nwould be, and at the same time it was so awful that she could not even\nconceive what it would end in.",
      "And she cried without restraint, as\nchildren cry when they are punished.",
      "The sound of the footman s steps forced her to rouse herself, and,\nhiding her face from him, she pretended to be writing.",
      "The courier asks if there s an answer,  the footman announced.",
      "An answer?",
      "Yes,  said Anna.",
      "Let him wait.",
      "I ll ring.",
      "What can I write?",
      "she thought.",
      "What can I decide upon alone?",
      "What do\nI know?",
      "What do I want?",
      "What is there I care for?",
      "Again she felt that\nher soul was beginning to be split in two.",
      "She was terrified again at\nthis feeling, and clutched at the first pretext for doing something\nwhich might divert her thoughts from herself.",
      "I ought to see Alexey \n(so she called Vronsky in her thoughts);  no one but he can tell me\nwhat I ought to do.",
      "I ll go to Betsy s, perhaps I shall see him there, \nshe said to herself, completely forgetting that when she had told him\nthe day before that she was not going to Princess Tverskaya s, he had\nsaid that in that case he should not go either.",
      "She went up to the\ntable, wrote to her husband,  I have received your letter.",
      "A. ; and,\nringing the bell, gave it to the footman.",
      "We are not going,  she said to Annushka, as she came in.",
      "Not going at all?",
      "No; don t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait.",
      "I m going\nto the princess s. \n\n Which dress am I to get ready?",
      "Chapter 17\n\nThe croquet party to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was\nto consist of two ladies and their adorers.",
      "These two ladies were the\nchief representatives of a select new Petersburg circle, nicknamed, in\nimitation of some imitation, _les sept merveilles du monde_.",
      "These\nladies belonged to a circle which, though of the highest society, was\nutterly hostile to that in which Anna moved.",
      "Moreover, Stremov, one of\nthe most influential people in Petersburg, and the elderly admirer of\nLiza Merkalova, was Alexey Alexandrovitch s enemy in the political\nworld.",
      "From all these considerations Anna had not meant to go, and the\nhints in Princess Tverskaya s note referred to her refusal.",
      "But now\nAnna was eager to go, in the hope of seeing Vronsky.",
      "Anna arrived at Princess Tverskaya s earlier than the other guests.",
      "At the same moment as she entered, Vronsky s footman, with\nside-whiskers combed out like a _Kammerjunker_, went in too.",
      "He stopped\nat the door, and, taking off his cap, let her pass.",
      "Anna recognized\nhim, and only then recalled that Vronsky had told her the day before\nthat he would not come.",
      "Most likely he was sending a note to say so.",
      "As she took off her outer garment in the hall, she heard the footman,\npronouncing his  _r s_  even like a _Kammerjunker_, say,  From the\ncount for the princess,  and hand the note.",
      "She longed to question him as to where his master was.",
      "She longed to\nturn back and send him a letter to come and see her, or to go herself\nto see him.",
      "But neither the first nor the second nor the third course\nwas possible.",
      "Already she heard bells ringing to announce her arrival\nahead of her, and Princess Tverskaya s footman was standing at the open\ndoor waiting for her to go forward into the inner rooms.",
      "The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately.",
      "Would\nyou be pleased to walk into the garden?",
      "announced another footman in\nanother room.",
      "The position of uncertainty, of indecision, was still the same as at\nhome worse, in fact, since it was impossible to take any step,\nimpossible to see Vronsky, and she had to remain here among outsiders,\nin company so uncongenial to her present mood.",
      "But she was wearing a\ndress that she knew suited her.",
      "She was not alone; all around was that\nluxurious setting of idleness that she was used to, and she felt less\nwretched than at home.",
      "She was not forced to think what she was to do.",
      "Everything would be done of itself.",
      "On meeting Betsy coming towards her\nin a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her\njust as she always did.",
      "Princess Tverskaya was walking with Tushkevitch\nand a young lady, a relation, who, to the great joy of her parents in\nthe provinces, was spending the summer with the fashionable princess.",
      "There was probably something unusual about Anna, for Betsy noticed it\nat once.",
      "I slept badly,  answered Anna, looking intently at the footman who\ncame to meet them, and, as she supposed, brought Vronsky s note.",
      "How glad I am you ve come!",
      "said Betsy.",
      "I m tired, and was just\nlonging to have some tea before they come.",
      "You might go she turned to\nTushkevitch with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where\nthey ve been cutting it.",
      "We shall have time to talk a little over tea;\nwe ll have a cozy chat, eh?",
      "she said in English to Anna, with a smile,\npressing the hand with which she held a parasol.",
      "Yes, especially as I can t stay very long with you.",
      "I m forced to go\non to old Madame Vrede.",
      "I ve been promising to go for a century,  said\nAnna, to whom lying, alien as it was to her nature, had become not\nmerely simple and natural in society, but a positive source of\nsatisfaction.",
      "Why she said this, which she had not thought of a second\nbefore, she could not have explained.",
      "She had said it simply from the\nreflection that as Vronsky would not be here, she had better secure her\nown freedom, and try to see him somehow.",
      "But why she had spoken of old\nMadame Vrede, whom she had to go and see, as she had to see many other\npeople, she could not have explained; and yet, as it afterwards turned\nout, had she contrived the most cunning devices to meet Vronsky, she\ncould have thought of nothing better.",
      "No.",
      "I m not going to let you go for anything,  answered Betsy, looking\nintently into Anna s face.",
      "Really, if I were not fond of you, I should\nfeel offended.",
      "One would think you were afraid my society would\ncompromise you.",
      "Tea in the little dining-room, please,  she said, half\nclosing her eyes, as she always did when addressing the footman.",
      "Taking the note from him, she read it.",
      "Alexey s playing us false,  she said in French;  he writes that he\ncan t come,  she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it\ncould never enter her head that Vronsky could mean anything more to\nAnna than a game of croquet.",
      "Anna knew that Betsy knew everything, but,\nhearing how she spoke of Vronsky before her, she almost felt persuaded\nfor a minute that she knew nothing.",
      "Ah!",
      "said Anna indifferently, as though not greatly interested in the\nmatter, and she went on smiling:  How can you or your friends\ncompromise anyone?",
      "This playing with words, this hiding of a secret, had a great\nfascination for Anna, as, indeed, it has for all women.",
      "And it was not\nthe necessity of concealment, not the aim with which the concealment\nwas contrived, but the process of concealment itself which attracted\nher.",
      "I can t be more Catholic than the Pope,  she said.",
      "Stremov and Liza\nMerkalova, why, they re the cream of the cream of society.",
      "Besides,\nthey re received everywhere, and _I_ she laid special stress on the\nI have never been strict and intolerant.",
      "It s simply that I haven t\nthe time.",
      "No; you don t care, perhaps, to meet Stremov?",
      "Let him and Alexey\nAlexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee that s no affair of\nours.",
      "But in the world, he s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted\ncroquet player.",
      "You shall see.",
      "And, in spite of his absurd position as\nLiza s lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off\nthe absurd position.",
      "He s very nice.",
      "Sappho Shtoltz you don t know?",
      "Oh,\nthat s a new type, quite new.",
      "Betsy said all this, and, at the same time, from her good-humored,\nshrewd glance, Anna felt that she partly guessed her plight, and was\nhatching something for her benefit.",
      "They were in the little boudoir.",
      "I must write to Alexey though,  and Betsy sat down to the table,\nscribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.",
      "I m telling him to come to dinner.",
      "I ve one lady extra to dinner with\nme, and no man to take her in.",
      "Look what I ve said, will that persuade\nhim?",
      "Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute.",
      "Would you seal it up,\nplease, and send it off?",
      "she said from the door;  I have to give some\ndirections.",
      "Without a moment s thought, Anna sat down to the table with Betsy s\nletter, and, without reading it, wrote below:  It s essential for me to\nsee you.",
      "Come to the Vrede garden.",
      "I shall be there at six o clock.",
      "She sealed it up, and, Betsy coming back, in her presence handed the\nnote to be taken.",
      "At tea, which was brought them on a little tea-table in the cool little\ndrawing-room, the cozy chat promised by Princess Tverskaya before the\narrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women.",
      "They\ncriticized the people they were expecting, and the conversation fell\nupon Liza Merkalova.",
      "She s very sweet, and I always liked her,  said Anna.",
      "You ought to like her.",
      "She raves about you.",
      "Yesterday she came up to\nme after the races and was in despair at not finding you.",
      "She says\nyou re a real heroine of romance, and that if she were a man she would\ndo all sorts of mad things for your sake.",
      "Stremov says she does that as\nit is.",
      "But do tell me, please, I never could make it out,  said Anna, after\nbeing silent for some time, speaking in a tone that showed she was not\nasking an idle question, but that what she was asking was of more\nimportance to her than it should have been;  do tell me, please, what\nare her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as he s called?",
      "I ve\nmet them so little.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "Betsy smiled with her eyes, and looked intently at Anna.",
      "It s a new manner,  she said.",
      "They ve all adopted that manner.",
      "They ve flung their caps over the windmills.",
      "But there are ways and\nways of flinging them.",
      "Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?",
      "Betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter, a\nthing which rarely happened with her.",
      "You re encroaching on Princess Myakaya s special domain now.",
      "That s\nthe question of an _enfant terrible_,  and Betsy obviously tried to\nrestrain herself, but could not, and went off into peals of that\ninfectious laughter that people laugh who do not laugh often.",
      "You d\nbetter ask them,  she brought out, between tears of laughter.",
      "No; you laugh,  said Anna, laughing too in spite of herself,  but I\nnever could understand it.",
      "I can t understand the husband s r le in\nit.",
      "The husband?",
      "Liza Merkalova s husband carries her shawl, and is always\nready to be of use.",
      "But anything more than that in reality, no one\ncares to inquire.",
      "You know in decent society one doesn t talk or think\neven of certain details of the toilet.",
      "That s how it is with this.",
      "Will you be at Madame Rolandak s f te?",
      "asked Anna, to change the\nconversation.",
      "I don t think so,  answered Betsy, and, without looking at her friend,\nshe began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea.",
      "Putting a cup before Anna, she took out a cigarette, and, fitting it\ninto a silver holder, she lighted it.",
      "It s like this, you see: I m in a fortunate position,  she began,\nquite serious now, as she took up her cup.",
      "I understand you, and I\nunderstand Liza.",
      "Liza now is one of those na ve natures that, like\nchildren, don t know what s good and what s bad.",
      "Anyway, she didn t\ncomprehend it when she was very young.",
      "And now she s aware that the\nlack of comprehension suits her.",
      "Now, perhaps, she doesn t know on\npurpose,  said Betsy, with a subtle smile.",
      "But, anyway, it suits her.",
      "The very same thing, don t you see, may be looked at tragically, and\nturned into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even\nhumorously.",
      "Possibly you are inclined to look at things too\ntragically.",
      "How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!",
      "said\nAnna, seriously and dreamily.",
      "Am I worse than other people, or better?",
      "I think I m worse.",
      "_Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!_  repeated Betsy.",
      "But here they\nare.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nThey heard the sound of steps and a man s voice, then a woman s voice\nand laughter, and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected\nguests: Sappho Shtoltz, and a young man beaming with excess of health,\nthe so-called Vaska.",
      "It was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak,\ntruffles, and Burgundy never failed to reach him at the fitting hour.",
      "Vaska bowed to the two ladies, and glanced at them, but only for one\nsecond.",
      "He walked after Sappho into the drawing-room, and followed her\nabout as though he were chained to her, keeping his sparkling eyes\nfixed on her as though he wanted to eat her.",
      "Sappho Shtoltz was a\nblonde beauty with black eyes.",
      "She walked with smart little steps in\nhigh-heeled shoes, and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a\nman.",
      "Anna had never met this new star of fashion, and was struck by her\nbeauty, the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried, and the\nboldness of her manners.",
      "On her head there was such a superstructure of\nsoft, golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in\nsize to the elegantly rounded bust, of which so much was exposed in\nfront.",
      "The impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every\nstep the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were\ndistinctly marked under her dress, and the question involuntarily rose\nto the mind where in the undulating, piled-up mountain of material at\nthe back the real body of the woman, so small and slender, so naked in\nfront, and so hidden behind and below, really came to an end.",
      "Betsy made haste to introduce her to Anna.",
      "Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,  she began telling them\nat once, using her eyes, smiling and twitching away her tail, which she\nflung back at one stroke all on one side.",
      "I drove here with Vaska....\nAh, to be sure, you don t know each other.",
      "And mentioning his surname\nshe introduced the young man, and reddening a little, broke into a\nringing laugh at her mistake that is, at her having called him Vaska to\na stranger.",
      "Vaska bowed once more to Anna, but he said nothing to her.",
      "He addressed Sappho:  You ve lost your bet.",
      "We got here first.",
      "Pay up, \nsaid he, smiling.",
      "Sappho laughed still more festively.",
      "Not just now,  said she.",
      "Oh, all right, I ll have it later.",
      "Very well, very well.",
      "Oh, yes.",
      "She turned suddenly to Princess Betsy:\n I am a nice person ...",
      "I positively forgot it ...",
      "I ve brought you a\nvisitor.",
      "And here he comes.",
      "The unexpected young visitor, whom Sappho\nhad invited, and whom she had forgotten, was, however, a personage of\nsuch consequence that, in spite of his youth, both the ladies rose on\nhis entrance.",
      "He was a new admirer of Sappho s. He now dogged her footsteps, like\nVaska.",
      "Soon after Prince Kaluzhsky arrived, and Liza Merkalova with Stremov.",
      "Liza Merkalova was a thin brunette, with an Oriental, languid type of\nface, and as everyone used to say exquisite enigmatic eyes.",
      "The tone of\nher dark dress (Anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact) was\nin perfect harmony with her style of beauty.",
      "Liza was as soft and\nenervated as Sappho was smart and abrupt.",
      "But to Anna s taste Liza was far more attractive.",
      "Betsy had said to\nAnna that she had adopted the pose of an innocent child, but when Anna\nsaw her, she felt that this was not the truth.",
      "She really was both\ninnocent and corrupt, but a sweet and passive woman.",
      "It is true that\nher tone was the same as Sappho s; that like Sappho, she had two men,\none young and one old, tacked onto her, and devouring her with their\neyes.",
      "But there was something in her higher than what surrounded her.",
      "There was in her the glow of the real diamond among glass imitations.",
      "This glow shone out in her exquisite, truly enigmatic eyes.",
      "The weary,\nand at the same time passionate, glance of those eyes, encircled by\ndark rings, impressed one by its perfect sincerity.",
      "Everyone looking\ninto those eyes fancied he knew her wholly, and knowing her, could not\nbut love her.",
      "At the sight of Anna, her whole face lighted up at once\nwith a smile of delight.",
      "Ah, how glad I am to see you!",
      "she said, going up to her.",
      "Yesterday\nat the races all I wanted was to get to you, but you d gone away.",
      "I did\nso want to see you, yesterday especially.",
      "Wasn t it awful?",
      "she said,\nlooking at Anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul.",
      "Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,  said Anna, blushing.",
      "The company got up at this moment to go into the garden.",
      "I m not going,  said Liza, smiling and settling herself close to Anna.",
      "You won t go either, will you?",
      "Who wants to play croquet?",
      "Oh, I like it,  said Anna.",
      "There, how do you manage never to be bored by things?",
      "It s delightful\nto look at you.",
      "You re alive, but I m bored.",
      "How can you be bored?",
      "Why, you live in the liveliest set in\nPetersburg,  said Anna.",
      "Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but\nwe I certainly are not happy, but awfully, awfully bored.",
      "Sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young\nmen.",
      "Betsy and Stremov remained at the tea-table.",
      "What, bored!",
      "said Betsy.",
      "Sappho says they did enjoy themselves\ntremendously at your house last night.",
      "Ah, how dreary it all was!",
      "said Liza Merkalova.",
      "We all drove back to\nmy place after the races.",
      "And always the same people, always the same.",
      "Always the same thing.",
      "We lounged about on sofas all the evening.",
      "What\nis there to enjoy in that?",
      "No; do tell me how you manage never to be\nbored?",
      "she said, addressing Anna again.",
      "One has but to look at you\nand one sees, here s a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but isn t\nbored.",
      "Tell me how you do it?",
      "I do nothing,  answered Anna, blushing at these searching questions.",
      "That s the best way,  Stremov put in.",
      "Stremov was a man of fifty,\npartly gray, but still vigorous-looking, very ugly, but with a\ncharacteristic and intelligent face.",
      "Liza Merkalova was his wife s\nniece, and he spent all his leisure hours with her.",
      "On meeting Anna\nKarenina, as he was Alexey Alexandrovitch s enemy in the government, he\ntried, like a shrewd man and a man of the world, to be particularly\ncordial with her, the wife of his enemy.",
      "Nothing,  he put in with a subtle smile,  that s the very best way.",
      "I told you long ago,  he said, turning to Liza Merkalova,  that if you\ndon t want to be bored, you mustn t think you re going to be bored.",
      "It s just as you mustn t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if\nyou re afraid of sleeplessness.",
      "That s just what Anna Arkadyevna has\njust said.",
      "I should be very glad if I had said it, for it s not only clever but\ntrue,  said Anna, smiling.",
      "No, do tell me why it is one can t go to sleep, and one can t help\nbeing bored?",
      "To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to\nwork too.",
      "What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody?",
      "And I can t\nand won t knowingly make a pretense about it.",
      "You re incorrigible,  said Stremov, not looking at her, and he spoke\nagain to Anna.",
      "As he rarely met Anna, he could say nothing but\ncommonplaces to her, but he said those commonplaces as to when she was\nreturning to Petersburg, and how fond Countess Lidia Ivanovna was of\nher, with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole\nsoul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that.",
      "Tushkevitch came in, announcing that the party were awaiting the other\nplayers to begin croquet.",
      "No, don t go away, please don t,  pleaded Liza Merkalova, hearing that\nAnna was going.",
      "Stremov joined in her entreaties.",
      "It s too violent a transition,  he said,  to go from such company to\nold Madame Vrede.",
      "And besides, you will only give her a chance for\ntalking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings\nof the highest and most opposite kind,  he said to her.",
      "Anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty.",
      "This shrewd man s\nflattering words, the na ve, childlike affection shown her by Liza\nMerkalova, and all the social atmosphere she was used to, it was all so\neasy, and what was in store for her was so difficult, that she was for\na minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little\nlonger the painful moment of explanation.",
      "But remembering what was in\nstore for her alone at home, if she did not come to some decision,\nremembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched\nher hair in both hands she said good-bye and went away.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nIn spite of Vronsky s apparently frivolous life in society, he was a\nman who hated irregularity.",
      "In early youth in the Corps of Pages, he\nhad experienced the humiliation of a refusal, when he had tried, being\nin difficulties, to borrow money, and since then he had never once put\nhimself in the same position again.",
      "In order to keep his affairs in some sort of order, he used about five\ntimes a year (more or less frequently, according to circumstances) to\nshut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape.",
      "This\nhe used to call his day of reckoning or _faire la lessive_.",
      "On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen\ncoat, and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the\ntable moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work.",
      "Petritsky, who knew\nhe was ill-tempered on such occasions, on waking up and seeing his\ncomrade at the writing-table, quietly dressed and went out without\ngetting in his way.",
      "Every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the\nconditions surrounding him, cannot help imagining that the complexity\nof these conditions, and the difficulty of making them clear, is\nsomething exceptional and personal, peculiar to himself, and never\nsupposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of\npersonal affairs as he is.",
      "So indeed it seemed to Vronsky.",
      "And not\nwithout inward pride, and not without reason, he thought that any other\nman would long ago have been in difficulties, would have been forced to\nsome dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult\nposition.",
      "But Vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him\nto clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into\ndifficulties.",
      "What Vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary\nposition.",
      "Writing out on note paper in his minute hand all that he\nowed, he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to\nseventeen thousand and some odd hundreds, which he left out for the\nsake of clearness.",
      "Reckoning up his money and his bank book, he found\nthat he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles, and nothing coming\nin before the New Year.",
      "Reckoning over again his list of debts, Vronsky\ncopied it, dividing it into three classes.",
      "In the first class he put\nthe debts which he would have to pay at once, or for which he must in\nany case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there could\nnot be a moment s delay in paying.",
      "Such debts amounted to about four\nthousand: one thousand five hundred for a horse, and two thousand five\nhundred as surety for a young comrade, Venovsky, who had lost that sum\nto a cardsharper in Vronsky s presence.",
      "Vronsky had wanted to pay the\nmoney at the time (he had that amount then), but Venovsky and Yashvin\nhad insisted that they would pay and not Vronsky, who had not played.",
      "That was so far well, but Vronsky knew that in this dirty business,\nthough his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be\nsurety for Venovsky, it was absolutely necessary for him to have the\ntwo thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the\nswindler, and have no more words with him.",
      "And so for this first and\nmost important division he must have four thousand roubles.",
      "The second\nclass eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts.",
      "These\nwere principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses, to\nthe purveyor of oats and hay, the English saddler, and so on.",
      "He would\nhave to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too, in order to\nbe quite free from anxiety.",
      "The last class of debts to shops, to\nhotels, to his tailor were such as need not be considered.",
      "So that he\nneeded at least six thousand roubles for current expenses, and he only\nhad one thousand eight hundred.",
      "For a man with one hundred thousand\nroubles of revenue, which was what everyone fixed as Vronsky s income,\nsuch debts, one would suppose, could hardly be embarrassing; but the\nfact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand.",
      "His father s\nimmense property, which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred\nthousand, was left undivided between the brothers.",
      "At the time when the\nelder brother, with a mass of debts, married Princess Varya Tchirkova,\nthe daughter of a Decembrist without any fortune whatever, Alexey had\ngiven up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his father s\nestate, reserving for himself only twenty-five thousand a year from it.",
      "Alexey had said at the time to his brother that that sum would be\nsufficient for him until he married, which he probably never would do.",
      "And his brother, who was in command of one of the most expensive\nregiments, and was only just married, could not decline the gift.",
      "His\nmother, who had her own separate property, had allowed Alexey every\nyear twenty thousand in addition to the twenty-five thousand he had\nreserved, and Alexey had spent it all.",
      "Of late his mother, incensed\nwith him on account of his love affair and his leaving Moscow, had\ngiven up sending him the money.",
      "And in consequence of this, Vronsky,\nwho had been in the habit of living on the scale of forty-five thousand\na year, having only received twenty thousand that year, found himself\nnow in difficulties.",
      "To get out of these difficulties, he could not\napply to his mother for money.",
      "Her last letter, which he had received\nthe day before, had particularly exasperated him by the hints in it\nthat she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the\narmy, but not to lead a life which was a scandal to all good society.",
      "His mother s attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him\nfeel colder than ever to her.",
      "But he could not draw back from the\ngenerous word when it was once uttered, even though he felt now,\nvaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his intrigue with Madame\nKarenina, that this generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly, and\nthat even though he were not married he might need all the hundred\nthousand of income.",
      "But it was impossible to draw back.",
      "He had only to\nrecall his brother s wife, to remember how that sweet, delightful Varya\nsought, at every convenient opportunity, to remind him that she\nremembered his generosity and appreciated it, to grasp the\nimpossibility of taking back his gift.",
      "It was as impossible as beating\na woman, stealing, or lying.",
      "One thing only could and ought to be done,\nand Vronsky determined upon it without an instant s hesitation: to\nborrow money from a money-lender, ten thousand roubles, a proceeding\nwhich presented no difficulty, to cut down his expenses generally, and\nto sell his race horses.",
      "Resolving on this, he promptly wrote a note to\nRolandak, who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses\nfrom him.",
      "Then he sent for the Englishman and the money-lender, and\ndivided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay.",
      "Having finished this business, he wrote a cold and cutting answer to\nhis mother.",
      "Then he took out of his notebook three notes of Anna s,\nread them again, burned them, and remembering their conversation on the\nprevious day, he sank into meditation.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nVronsky s life was particularly happy in that he had a code of\nprinciples, which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and\nwhat he ought not to do.",
      "This code of principles covered only a very\nsmall circle of contingencies, but then the principles were never\ndoubtful, and Vronsky, as he never went outside that circle, had never\nhad a moment s hesitation about doing what he ought to do.",
      "These\nprinciples laid down as invariable rules: that one must pay a\ncardsharper, but need not pay a tailor; that one must never tell a lie\nto a man, but one may to a woman; that one must never cheat anyone, but\none may a husband; that one must never pardon an insult, but one may\ngive one and so on.",
      "These principles were possibly not reasonable and\nnot good, but they were of unfailing certainty, and so long as he\nadhered to them, Vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could\nhold his head up.",
      "Only quite lately in regard to his relations with\nAnna, Vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not\nfully cover all possible contingencies, and to foresee in the future\ndifficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue.",
      "His present relation to Anna and to her husband was to his mind clear\nand simple.",
      "It was clearly and precisely defined in the code of\nprinciples by which he was guided.",
      "She was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him, and he\nloved her, and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to\nthe same, or even more, respect than a lawful wife.",
      "He would have had\nhis hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word, by\na hint, to humiliate her, or even to fall short of the fullest respect\na woman could look for.",
      "His attitude to society, too, was clear.",
      "Everyone might know, might\nsuspect it, but no one might dare to speak of it.",
      "If any did so, he was\nready to force all who might speak to be silent and to respect the\nnon-existent honor of the woman he loved.",
      "His attitude to the husband was the clearest of all.",
      "From the moment\nthat Anna loved Vronsky, he had regarded his own right over her as the\none thing unassailable.",
      "Her husband was simply a superfluous and\ntiresome person.",
      "No doubt he was in a pitiable position, but how could\nthat be helped?",
      "The one thing the husband had a right to was to demand\nsatisfaction with a weapon in his hand, and Vronsky was prepared for\nthis at any minute.",
      "But of late new inner relations had arisen between him and her, which\nfrightened Vronsky by their indefiniteness.",
      "Only the day before she had\ntold him that she was with child.",
      "And he felt that this fact and what\nshe expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code\nof principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life.",
      "And\nhe had been indeed caught unawares, and at the first moment when she\nspoke to him of her position, his heart had prompted him to beg her to\nleave her husband.",
      "He had said that, but now thinking things over he\nsaw clearly that it would be better to manage to avoid that; and at the\nsame time, as he told himself so, he was afraid whether it was not\nwrong.",
      "If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her life\nwith mine; am I prepared for that?",
      "How can I take her away now, when I\nhave no money?",
      "Supposing I could arrange....",
      "But how can I take her\naway while I m in the service?",
      "If I say that I ought to be prepared to\ndo it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.",
      "And he grew thoughtful.",
      "The question whether to retire from the service\nor not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden\ninterest of his life, of which none knew but he.",
      "Ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood, a dream which he\ndid not confess even to himself, though it was so strong that now this\npassion was even doing battle with his love.",
      "His first steps in the\nworld and in the service had been successful, but two years before he\nhad made a great mistake.",
      "Anxious to show his independence and to\nadvance, he had refused a post that had been offered him, hoping that\nthis refusal would heighten his value; but it turned out that he had\nbeen too bold, and he was passed over.",
      "And having, whether he liked or\nnot, taken up for himself the position of an independent man, he\ncarried it off with great tact and good sense, behaving as though he\nbore no grudge against anyone, did not regard himself as injured in any\nway, and cared for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying\nhimself.",
      "In reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the\nyear before, when he went away to Moscow.",
      "He felt that this independent\nattitude of a man who might have done anything, but cared to do\nnothing, was already beginning to pall, that many people were beginning\nto fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a\nstraightforward, good-natured fellow.",
      "His connection with Madame\nKarenina, by creating so much sensation and attracting general\nattention, had given him a fresh distinction which soothed his gnawing\nworm of ambition for a while, but a week before that worm had been\nroused up again with fresh force.",
      "The friend of his childhood, a man of\nthe same set, of the same coterie, his comrade in the Corps of Pages,\nSerpuhovskoy, who had left school with him and had been his rival in\nclass, in gymnastics, in their scrapes and their dreams of glory, had\ncome back a few days before from Central Asia, where he had gained two\nsteps up in rank, and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young.",
      "As soon as he arrived in Petersburg, people began to talk about him as\na newly risen star of the first magnitude.",
      "A schoolfellow of Vronsky s\nand of the same age, he was a general and was expecting a command,\nwhich might have influence on the course of political events; while\nVronsky, independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman\nthough he was, was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to\nbe as independent as ever he liked.",
      "Of course I don t envy\nSerpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me\nthat one has only to watch one s opportunity, and the career of a man\nlike me may be very rapidly made.",
      "Three years ago he was in just the\nsame position as I am.",
      "If I retire, I burn my ships.",
      "If I remain in the\narmy, I lose nothing.",
      "She said herself she did not wish to change her\nposition.",
      "And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy.",
      "And\nslowly twirling his mustaches, he got up from the table and walked\nabout the room.",
      "His eyes shone particularly brightly, and he felt in\nthat confident, calm, and happy frame of mind which always came after\nhe had thoroughly faced his position.",
      "Everything was straight and\nclear, just as after former days of reckoning.",
      "He shaved, took a cold\nbath, dressed and went out.",
      "Chapter 21\n\n We ve come to fetch you.",
      "Your _lessive_ lasted a good time today, \nsaid Petritsky.",
      "Well, is it over?",
      "It is over,  answered Vronsky, smiling with his eyes only, and\ntwirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the\nperfect order into which his affairs had been brought any over-bold or\nrapid movement might disturb it.",
      "You re always just as if you d come out of a bath after it,  said\nPetritsky.",
      "I ve come from Gritsky s  (that was what they called the\ncolonel);  they re expecting you.",
      "Vronsky, without answering, looked at his comrade, thinking of\nsomething else.",
      "Yes; is that music at his place?",
      "he said, listening to the familiar\nsounds of polkas and waltzes floating across to him.",
      "What s the f te?",
      "Serpuhovskoy s come.",
      "Aha!",
      "said Vronsky,  why, I didn t know.",
      "The smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever.",
      "Having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love, that he\nsacrificed his ambition to it having anyway taken up this position,\nVronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of Serpuhovskoy or hurt\nwith him for not coming first to him when he came to the regiment.",
      "Serpuhovskoy was a good friend, and he was delighted he had come.",
      "Ah, I m very glad!",
      "The colonel, Demin, had taken a large country house.",
      "The whole party\nwere in the wide lower balcony.",
      "In the courtyard the first objects that\nmet Vronsky s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats,\nstanding near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of\nthe colonel surrounded by officers.",
      "He had gone out as far as the first\nstep of the balcony and was loudly shouting across the band that played\nOffenbach s quadrille, waving his arms and giving some orders to a few\nsoldiers standing on one side.",
      "A group of soldiers, a quartermaster,\nand several subalterns came up to the balcony with Vronsky.",
      "The colonel\nreturned to the table, went out again onto the steps with a tumbler in\nhis hand, and proposed the toast,  To the health of our former comrade,\nthe gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy.",
      "Hurrah!",
      "The colonel was followed by Serpuhovskoy, who came out onto the steps\nsmiling, with a glass in his hand.",
      "You always get younger, Bondarenko,  he said to the rosy-cheeked,\nsmart-looking quartermaster standing just before him, still youngish\nlooking though doing his second term of service.",
      "It was three years since Vronsky had seen Serpuhovskoy.",
      "He looked more\nrobust, had let his whiskers grow, but was still the same graceful\ncreature, whose face and figure were even more striking from their\nsoftness and nobility than their beauty.",
      "The only change Vronsky\ndetected in him was that subdued, continual radiance of beaming content\nwhich settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of\nthe recognition of their success by everyone.",
      "Vronsky knew that radiant\nair, and immediately observed it in Serpuhovskoy.",
      "As Serpuhovskoy came down the steps he saw Vronsky.",
      "A smile of pleasure\nlighted up his face.",
      "He tossed his head upwards and waved the glass in\nhis hand, greeting Vronsky, and showing him by the gesture that he\ncould not come to him before the quartermaster, who stood craning\nforward his lips ready to be kissed.",
      "Here he is!",
      "shouted the colonel.",
      "Yashvin told me you were in one of\nyour gloomy tempers.",
      "Serpuhovskoy kissed the moist, fresh lips of the gallant-looking\nquartermaster, and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief, went up to\nVronsky.",
      "How glad I am!",
      "he said, squeezing his hand and drawing him on one\nside.",
      "You look after him,  the colonel shouted to Yashvin, pointing to\nVronsky; and he went down below to the soldiers.",
      "Why weren t you at the races yesterday?",
      "I expected to see you there, \nsaid Vronsky, scrutinizing Serpuhovskoy.",
      "I did go, but late.",
      "I beg your pardon,  he added, and he turned to the\nadjutant:  Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it\nruns to.",
      "And he hurriedly took notes for three hundred roubles from\nhis pocketbook, blushing a little.",
      "Vronsky!",
      "Have anything to eat or drink?",
      "asked Yashvin.",
      "Hi, something\nfor the count to eat!",
      "Ah, here it is: have a glass!",
      "The f te at the colonel s lasted a long while.",
      "There was a great deal\nof drinking.",
      "They tossed Serpuhovskoy in the air and caught him again\nseveral times.",
      "Then they did the same to the colonel.",
      "Then, to the\naccompaniment of the band, the colonel himself danced with Petritsky.",
      "Then the colonel, who began to show signs of feebleness, sat down on a\nbench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to Yashvin the\nsuperiority of Russia over Prussia, especially in cavalry attack, and\nthere was a lull in the revelry for a moment.",
      "Serpuhovskoy went into\nthe house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found Vronsky there;\nVronsky was drenching his head with water.",
      "He had taken off his coat\nand put his sunburnt, hairy neck under the tap, and was rubbing it and\nhis head with his hands.",
      "When he had finished, Vronsky sat down by\nSerpuhovskoy.",
      "They both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge, and a\nconversation began which was very interesting to both of them.",
      "I ve always been hearing about you through my wife,  said\nSerpuhovskoy.",
      "I m glad you ve been seeing her pretty often.",
      "She s friendly with Varya, and they re the only women in Petersburg I\ncare about seeing,  answered Vronsky, smiling.",
      "He smiled because he\nforesaw the topic the conversation would turn on, and he was glad of\nit.",
      "The only ones?",
      "Serpuhovskoy queried, smiling.",
      "Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,  said\nVronsky, checking his hint by a stern expression of face.",
      "I was\ngreatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised.",
      "I\nexpected even more.",
      "Serpuhovskoy smiled.",
      "Such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to\nhim, and he did not think it necessary to conceal it.",
      "Well, I on the contrary expected less I ll own frankly.",
      "But I m glad,\nvery glad.",
      "I m ambitious; that s my weakness, and I confess to it.",
      "Perhaps you wouldn t confess to it if you hadn t been successful, \nsaid Vronsky.",
      "I don t suppose so,  said Serpuhovskoy, smiling again.",
      "I won t say\nlife wouldn t be worth living without it, but it would be dull.",
      "Of\ncourse I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the\nline I ve chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to\nbe, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know, \nsaid Serpuhovskoy, with beaming consciousness of success;  and so the\nnearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.",
      "Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone.",
      "I used to think so\ntoo, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.",
      "There it s out!",
      "here it comes!",
      "said Serpuhovskoy, laughing.",
      "Ever\nsince I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I\napproved of what you did.",
      "But there are ways of doing everything.",
      "And I\nthink your action was good in itself, but you didn t do it quite in the\nway you ought to have done.",
      "What s done can t be undone, and you know I never go back on what I ve\ndone.",
      "And besides, I m very well off.",
      "Very well off for the time.",
      "But you re not satisfied with that.",
      "I\nwouldn t say this to your brother.",
      "He s a nice child, like our host\nhere.",
      "There he goes!",
      "he added, listening to the roar of  hurrah!",
      "and\nhe s happy, but that does not satisfy you.",
      "I didn t say it did satisfy me.",
      "Yes, but that s not the only thing.",
      "Such men as you are wanted.",
      "By whom?",
      "By whom?",
      "By society, by Russia.",
      "Russia needs men; she needs a party,\nor else everything goes and will go to the dogs.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "Bertenev s party against the Russian communists?",
      "No,  said Serpuhovskoy, frowning with vexation at being suspected of\nsuch an absurdity.",
      "_Tout  a est une blague_.",
      "That s always been and\nalways will be.",
      "There are no communists.",
      "But intriguing people have to\ninvent a noxious, dangerous party.",
      "It s an old trick.",
      "No, what s wanted\nis a powerful party of independent men like you and me.",
      "But why so?",
      "Vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power.",
      "Why\naren t they independent men?",
      "Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an\nindependent fortune; they ve not had a name, they ve not been close to\nthe sun and center as we have.",
      "They can be bought either by money or by\nfavor.",
      "And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a\npolicy.",
      "And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don t\nbelieve in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means\nto a government house and so much income.",
      "_Cela n est pas plus fin que\n a_, when you get a peep at their cards.",
      "I may be inferior to them,\nstupider perhaps, though I don t see why I should be inferior to them.",
      "But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in\nbeing more difficult to buy.",
      "And such men are more needed than ever.",
      "Vronsky listened attentively, but he was not so much interested by the\nmeaning of the words as by the attitude of Serpuhovskoy who was already\ncontemplating a struggle with the existing powers, and already had his\nlikes and dislikes in that higher world, while his own interest in the\ngoverning world did not go beyond the interests of his regiment.",
      "Vronsky felt, too, how powerful Serpuhovskoy might become through his\nunmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in,\nthrough his intelligence and gift of words, so rarely met with in the\nworld in which he moved.",
      "And, ashamed as he was of the feeling, he felt\nenvious.",
      "Still I haven t the one thing of most importance for that,  he\nanswered;  I haven t the desire for power.",
      "I had it once, but it s\ngone.",
      "Excuse me, that s not true,  said Serpuhovskoy, smiling.",
      "Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!",
      "Vronsky added, to be truthful.",
      "Yes, it s true now, that s another thing; but that _now_ won t last\nforever.",
      "Perhaps,  answered Vronsky.",
      "You say _perhaps_,  Serpuhovskoy went on, as though guessing his\nthoughts,  but I say _for certain_.",
      "And that s what I wanted to see you\nfor.",
      "Your action was just what it should have been.",
      "I see that, but you\nought not to keep it up.",
      "I only ask you to give me _carte blanche_.",
      "I m\nnot going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn t\nI protect you?",
      "you ve protected me often enough!",
      "I should hope our\nfriendship rises above all that sort of thing.",
      "Yes,  he said, smiling\nto him as tenderly as a woman,  give me _carte blanche_, retire from\nthe regiment, and I ll draw you upwards imperceptibly.",
      "But you must understand that I want nothing,  said Vronsky,  except\nthat all should be as it is.",
      "Serpuhovskoy got up and stood facing him.",
      "You say that all should be as it is.",
      "I understand what that means.",
      "But\nlisten: we re the same age, you ve known a greater number of women\nperhaps than I have.",
      "Serpohovskoy s smile and gestures told Vronsky\nthat he mustn t be afraid, that he would be tender and careful in\ntouching the sore place.",
      "But I m married, and believe me, in getting\nto know thoroughly one s wife, if one loves her, as someone has said,\none gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.",
      "We re coming directly!",
      "Vronsky shouted to an officer, who looked into\nthe room and called them to the colonel.",
      "Vronsky was longing now to hear to the end and know what Serpuhovskey\nwould say to him.",
      "And here s my opinion for you.",
      "Women are the chief stumbling block in\na man s career.",
      "It s hard to love a woman and do anything.",
      "There s only\none way of having love conveniently without its being a\nhindrance that s marriage.",
      "How, how am I to tell you what I mean?",
      "said\nSerpuhovskoy, who liked similes.",
      "Wait a minute, wait a minute!",
      "Yes,\njust as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your\nhands, when the _fardeau_ is tied on your back, and that s marriage.",
      "And that s what I felt when I was married.",
      "My hands were suddenly set\nfree.",
      "But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your\nhands will always be so full that you can do nothing.",
      "Look at Mazankov,\nat Krupov.",
      "They ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.",
      "What women!",
      "said Vronsky, recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress\nwith whom the two men he had mentioned were connected.",
      "The firmer the woman s footing in society, the worse it is.",
      "That s\nmuch the same as not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms but\ntearing it away from someone else.",
      "You have never loved,  Vronsky said softly, looking straight before\nhim and thinking of Anna.",
      "Perhaps.",
      "But you remember what I ve said to you.",
      "And another thing,\nwomen are all more materialistic than men.",
      "We make something immense\nout of love, but they are always _terre- -terre_.",
      "Directly, directly!",
      "he cried to a footman who came in.",
      "But the\nfootman had not come to call them again, as he supposed.",
      "The footman\nbrought Vronsky a note.",
      "A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.",
      "Vronsky opened the letter, and flushed crimson.",
      "My head s begun to ache; I m going home,  he said to Serpuhovskoy.",
      "Oh, good-bye then.",
      "You give me _carte blanche!_ \n\n We ll talk about it later on; I ll look you up in Petersburg.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nIt was six o clock already, and so, in order to be there quickly, and\nat the same time not to drive with his own horses, known to everyone,\nVronsky got into Yashvin s hired fly, and told the driver to drive as\nquickly as possible.",
      "It was a roomy, old-fashioned fly, with seats for\nfour.",
      "He sat in one corner, stretched his legs out on the front seat,\nand sank into meditation.",
      "A vague sense of the order into which his affairs had been brought, a\nvague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of Serpuhovskoy,\nwho had considered him a man that was needed, and most of all, the\nanticipation of the interview before him all blended into a general,\njoyous sense of life.",
      "This feeling was so strong that he could not help\nsmiling.",
      "He dropped his legs, crossed one leg over the other knee, and\ntaking it in his hand, felt the springy muscle of the calf, where it\nhad been grazed the day before by his fall, and leaning back he drew\nseveral deep breaths.",
      "I m happy, very happy!",
      "he said to himself.",
      "He had often before had\nthis sense of physical joy in his own body, but he had never felt so\nfond of himself, of his own body, as at that moment.",
      "He enjoyed the\nslight ache in his strong leg, he enjoyed the muscular sensation of\nmovement in his chest as he breathed.",
      "The bright, cold August day,\nwhich had made Anna feel so hopeless, seemed to him keenly stimulating,\nand refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water.",
      "The scent of brilliantine on his whiskers struck him as particularly\npleasant in the fresh air.",
      "Everything he saw from the carriage window,\neverything in that cold pure air, in the pale light of the sunset, was\nas fresh, and gay, and strong as he was himself: the roofs of the\nhouses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of\nfences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the\ncarriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the trees\nand grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the\nslanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and\neven from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty\nlandscape just finished and freshly varnished.",
      "Get on, get on!",
      "he said to the driver, putting his head out of the\nwindow, and pulling a three-rouble note out of his pocket he handed it\nto the man as he looked round.",
      "The driver s hand fumbled with something\nat the lamp, the whip cracked, and the carriage rolled rapidly along\nthe smooth highroad.",
      "I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,  he thought, staring at\nthe bone button of the bell in the space between the windows, and\npicturing to himself Anna just as he had seen her last time.",
      "And as I\ngo on, I love her more and more.",
      "Here s the garden of the Vrede Villa.",
      "Whereabouts will she be?",
      "Where?",
      "How?",
      "Why did she fix on this place to\nmeet me, and why does she write in Betsy s letter?",
      "he thought,\nwondering now for the first time at it.",
      "But there was now no time for\nwonder.",
      "He called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue, and\nopening the door, jumped out of the carriage as it was moving, and went\ninto the avenue that led up to the house.",
      "There was no one in the\navenue; but looking round to the right he caught sight of her.",
      "Her face\nwas hidden by a veil, but he drank in with glad eyes the special\nmovement in walking, peculiar to her alone, the slope of the shoulders,\nand the setting of the head, and at once a sort of electric shock ran\nall over him.",
      "With fresh force, he felt conscious of himself from the\nspringy motions of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he\nbreathed, and something set his lips twitching.",
      "Joining him, she pressed his hand tightly.",
      "You re not angry that I sent for you?",
      "I absolutely had to see you, \nshe said; and the serious and set line of her lips, which he saw under\nthe veil, transformed his mood at once.",
      "I angry!",
      "But how have you come, where from?",
      "Never mind,  she said, laying her hand on his,  come along, I must\ntalk to you.",
      "He saw that something had happened, and that the interview would not be\na joyous one.",
      "In her presence he had no will of his own: without\nknowing the grounds of her distress, he already felt the same distress\nunconsciously passing over him.",
      "What is it?",
      "what?",
      "he asked her, squeezing her hand with his elbow,\nand trying to read her thoughts in her face.",
      "She walked on a few steps in silence, gathering up her courage; then\nsuddenly she stopped.",
      "I did not tell you yesterday,  she began, breathing quickly and\npainfully,  that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him\neverything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him\neverything.",
      "He heard her, unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as\nthough hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for\nher.",
      "But directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up, and a\nproud and hard expression came over his face.",
      "Yes, yes, that s better, a thousand times better!",
      "I know how painful\nit was,  he said.",
      "But she was not listening to his words, she was\nreading his thoughts from the expression of his face.",
      "She could not\nguess that that expression arose from the first idea that presented\nitself to Vronsky that a duel was now inevitable.",
      "The idea of a duel\nhad never crossed her mind, and so she put a different interpretation\non this passing expression of hardness.",
      "When she got her husband s letter, she knew then at the bottom of her\nheart that everything would go on in the old way, that she would not\nhave the strength of will to forego her position, to abandon her son,\nand to join her lover.",
      "The morning spent at Princess Tverskaya s had\nconfirmed her still more in this.",
      "But this interview was still of the\nutmost gravity for her.",
      "She hoped that this interview would transform\nher position, and save her.",
      "If on hearing this news he were to say to\nher resolutely, passionately, without an instant s wavering:  Throw up\neverything and come with me!",
      "she would give up her son and go away\nwith him.",
      "But this news had not produced what she had expected in him;\nhe simply seemed as though he were resenting some affront.",
      "It was not in the least painful to me.",
      "It happened of itself,  she\nsaid irritably;  and see....  she pulled her husband s letter out of\nher glove.",
      "I understand, I understand,  he interrupted her, taking the letter,\nbut not reading it, and trying to soothe her.",
      "The one thing I longed\nfor, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as\nto devote my life to your happiness.",
      "Why do you tell me that?",
      "she said.",
      "Do you suppose I can doubt it?",
      "If\nI doubted.... \n\n Who s that coming?",
      "said Vronsky suddenly, pointing to two ladies\nwalking towards them.",
      "Perhaps they know us!",
      "and he hurriedly turned\noff, drawing her after him into a side path.",
      "Oh, I don t care!",
      "she said.",
      "Her lips were quivering.",
      "And he fancied\nthat her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under the veil.",
      "I\ntell you that s not the point I can t doubt that; but see what he\nwrites to me.",
      "Read it.",
      "She stood still again.",
      "Again, just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her\nhusband, Vronsky, on reading the letter, was unconsciously carried away\nby the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the\nbetrayed husband.",
      "Now while he held his letter in his hands, he could\nnot help picturing the challenge, which he would most likely find at\nhome today or tomorrow, and the duel itself, in which, with the same\ncold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment\nhe would await the injured husband s shot, after having himself fired\ninto the air.",
      "And at that instant there flashed across his mind the\nthought of what Serpuhovskoy had just said to him, and what he had\nhimself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind\nhimself and he knew that this thought he could not tell her.",
      "Having read the letter, he raised his eyes to her, and there was no\ndetermination in them.",
      "She saw at once that he had been thinking about\nit before by himself.",
      "She knew that whatever he might say to her, he\nwould not say all he thought.",
      "And she knew that her last hope had\nfailed her.",
      "This was not what she had been reckoning on.",
      "You see the sort of man he is,  she said, with a shaking voice;\n he.... \n\n Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,  Vronsky interrupted.",
      "For God s\nsake, let me finish!",
      "he added, his eyes imploring her to give him time\nto explain his words.",
      "I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot\npossibly remain as he supposes.",
      "Why can t they?",
      "Anna said, restraining her tears, and obviously\nattaching no sort of consequence to what he said.",
      "She felt that her\nfate was sealed.",
      "Vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable, he thought things could\nnot go on as before, but he said something different.",
      "It can t go on.",
      "I hope that now you will leave him.",
      "I hope he was\nconfused, and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life.",
      "Tomorrow....  he was beginning.",
      "She did not let him go on.",
      "But my child!",
      "she shrieked.",
      "You see what he writes!",
      "I should have to\nleave him, and I can t and won t do that.",
      "But, for God s sake, which is better?",
      "leave your child, or keep up\nthis degrading position?",
      "To whom is it degrading?",
      "To all, and most of all to you.",
      "You say degrading ... don t say that.",
      "Those words have no meaning for\nme,  she said in a shaking voice.",
      "She did not want him now to say what\nwas untrue.",
      "She had nothing left her but his love, and she wanted to\nlove him.",
      "Don t you understand that from the day I loved you\neverything has changed for me?",
      "For me there is one thing, and one thing\nonly your love.",
      "If that s mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that\nnothing can be humiliating to me.",
      "I am proud of my position, because\n... proud of being ... proud....  She could not say what she was proud\nof.",
      "Tears of shame and despair choked her utterance.",
      "She stood still\nand sobbed.",
      "He felt, too, something swelling in his throat and twitching in his\nnose, and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of\nweeping.",
      "He could not have said exactly what it was touched him so.",
      "He\nfelt sorry for her, and he felt he could not help her, and with that he\nknew that he was to blame for her wretchedness, and that he had done\nsomething wrong.",
      "Is not a divorce possible?",
      "he said feebly.",
      "She shook her head, not\nanswering.",
      "Couldn t you take your son, and still leave him?",
      "Yes; but it all depends on him.",
      "Now I must go to him,  she said\nshortly.",
      "Her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had\nnot deceived her.",
      "On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.",
      "Yes,  she said.",
      "But don t let us talk any more of it.",
      "Anna s carriage, which she had sent away, and ordered to come back to\nthe little gate of the Vrede garden, drove up.",
      "Anna said good-bye to\nVronsky, and drove home.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nOn Monday there was the usual sitting of the Commission of the 2nd of\nJune.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch walked into the hall where the sitting was\nheld, greeted the members and the president, as usual, and sat down in\nhis place, putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him.",
      "Among\nthese papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the\nspeech he intended to make.",
      "But he did not really need these documents.",
      "He remembered every point, and did not think it necessary to go over in\nhis memory what he would say.",
      "He knew that when the time came, and when\nhe saw his enemy facing him, and studiously endeavoring to assume an\nexpression of indifference, his speech would flow of itself better than\nhe could prepare it now.",
      "He felt that the import of his speech was of\nsuch magnitude that every word of it would have weight.",
      "Meantime, as he\nlistened to the usual report, he had the most innocent and inoffensive\nair.",
      "No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and\nlong fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay\nbefore him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on\none side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words\nwould flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the\nmembers shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to\ncall for order.",
      "When the report was over, Alexey Alexandrovitch\nannounced in his subdued, delicate voice that he had several points to\nbring before the meeting in regard to the Commission for the\nReorganization of the Native Tribes.",
      "All attention was turned upon him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch cleared his throat, and not looking at his\nopponent, but selecting, as he always did while he was delivering his\nspeeches, the first person sitting opposite him, an inoffensive little\nold man, who never had an opinion of any sort in the Commission, began\nto expound his views.",
      "When he reached the point about the fundamental\nand radical law, his opponent jumped up and began to protest.",
      "Stremov,\nwho was also a member of the Commission, and also stung to the quick,\nbegan defending himself, and altogether a stormy sitting followed; but\nAlexey Alexandrovitch triumphed, and his motion was carried, three new\ncommissions were appointed, and the next day in a certain Petersburg\ncircle nothing else was talked of but this sitting.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s success had been even greater than he had anticipated.",
      "Next morning, Tuesday, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on waking up, recollected\nwith pleasure his triumph of the previous day, and he could not help\nsmiling, though he tried to appear indifferent, when the chief\nsecretary of his department, anxious to flatter him, informed him of\nthe rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the\nCommission.",
      "Absorbed in business with the chief secretary, Alexey Alexandrovitch\nhad completely forgotten that it was Tuesday, the day fixed by him for\nthe return of Anna Arkadyevna, and he was surprised and received a\nshock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival.",
      "Anna had arrived in Petersburg early in the morning; the carriage had\nbeen sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram, and so Alexey\nAlexandrovitch might have known of her arrival.",
      "But when she arrived,\nhe did not meet her.",
      "She was told that he had not yet gone out, but was\nbusy with his secretary.",
      "She sent word to her husband that she had\ncome, went to her own room, and occupied herself in sorting out her\nthings, expecting he would come to her.",
      "But an hour passed; he did not\ncome.",
      "She went into the dining-room on the pretext of giving some\ndirections, and spoke loudly on purpose, expecting him to come out\nthere; but he did not come, though she heard him go to the door of his\nstudy as he parted from the chief secretary.",
      "She knew that he usually\nwent out quickly to his office, and she wanted to see him before that,\nso that their attitude to one another might be defined.",
      "She walked across the drawing-room and went resolutely to him.",
      "When she\nwent into his study he was in official uniform, obviously ready to go\nout, sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows, looking\ndejectedly before him.",
      "She saw him before he saw her, and she saw that\nhe was thinking of her.",
      "On seeing her, he would have risen, but changed his mind, then his face\nflushed hotly a thing Anna had never seen before, and he got up quickly\nand went to meet her, looking not at her eyes, but above them at her\nforehead and hair.",
      "He went up to her, took her by the hand, and asked\nher to sit down.",
      "I am very glad you have come,  he said, sitting down beside her, and\nobviously wishing to say something, he stuttered.",
      "Several times he\ntried to begin to speak, but stopped.",
      "In spite of the fact that,\npreparing herself for meeting him, she had schooled herself to despise\nand reproach him, she did not know what to say to him, and she felt\nsorry for him.",
      "And so the silence lasted for some time.",
      "Is Seryozha\nquite well?",
      "he said, and not waiting for an answer, he added:  I\nshan t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.",
      "I had thought of going to Moscow,  she said.",
      "No, you did quite, quite right to come,  he said, and was silent\nagain.",
      "Seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation, she began\nherself.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch,  she said, looking at him and not dropping her\neyes under his persistent gaze at her hair,  I m a guilty woman, I m a\nbad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have\ncome to tell you that I can change nothing.",
      "I have asked you no question about that,  he said, all at once,\nresolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face;  that was\nas I had supposed.",
      "Under the influence of anger he apparently regained\ncomplete possession of all his faculties.",
      "But as I told you then, and\nhave written to you,  he said in a thin, shrill voice,  I repeat now,\nthat I am not bound to know this.",
      "I ignore it.",
      "Not all wives are so\nkind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news\nto their husbands.",
      "He laid special emphasis on the word  agreeable.",
      "I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as\nmy name is not disgraced.",
      "And so I simply inform you that our relations\nmust be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of\nyour compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my\nhonor.",
      "But our relations cannot be the same as always,  Anna began in a timid\nvoice, looking at him with dismay.",
      "When she saw once more those composed gestures, heard that shrill,\nchildish, and sarcastic voice, her aversion for him extinguished her\npity for him, and she felt only afraid, but at all costs she wanted to\nmake clear her position.",
      "I cannot be your wife while I....  she began.",
      "He laughed a cold and malignant laugh.",
      "The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your\nideas.",
      "I have too much respect or contempt, or both ...",
      "I respect your\npast and despise your present ... that I was far from the\ninterpretation you put on my words.",
      "Anna sighed and bowed her head.",
      "Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you\nshow,  he went on, getting hot,  announcing your infidelity to your\nhusband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently you can see\nanything reprehensible in performing a wife s duties in relation to\nyour husband.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "What is it you want of me?",
      "I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that\nneither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.",
      "That s not much, I think.",
      "And in return you will enjoy all the\nprivileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties.",
      "That s all\nI have to say to you.",
      "Now it s time for me to go.",
      "I m not dining at\nhome.",
      "He got up and moved towards the door.",
      "Anna got up too.",
      "Bowing in silence, he let her pass before him.",
      "Chapter 24\n\nThe night spent by Levin on the haycock did not pass without result for\nhim.",
      "The way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and\nhad lost all attraction for him.",
      "In spite of the magnificent harvest,\nnever had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there\nbeen so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the\npeasants as that year, and the origin of these failures and this\nhostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him.",
      "The delight he had\nexperienced in the work itself, and the consequent greater intimacy\nwith the peasants, the envy he felt of them, of their life, the desire\nto adopt that life, which had been to him that night not a dream but an\nintention, the execution of which he had thought out in detail all this\nhad so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had\nmanaged it, that he could not take his former interest in it, and could\nnot help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople\nwhich was the foundation of it all.",
      "The herd of improved cows such as\nPava, the whole land ploughed over and enriched, the nine level fields\nsurrounded with hedges, the two hundred and forty acres heavily\nmanured, the seed sown in drills, and all the rest of it it was all\nsplendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for\nthemselves and comrades people in sympathy with them.",
      "But he saw\nclearly now (his work on a book of agriculture, in which the chief\nelement in husbandry was to have been the laborer, greatly assisted him\nin this) that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a\ncruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers, in which\nthere was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change\neverything to a pattern he considered better; on the other side, the\nnatural order of things.",
      "And in this struggle he saw that with immense\nexpenditure of force on his side, and with no effort or even intention\non the other side, all that was attained was that the work did not go\nto the liking of either side, and that splendid tools, splendid cattle\nand land were spoiled with no good to anyone.",
      "Worst of all, the energy\nexpended on this work was not simply wasted.",
      "He could not help feeling\nnow, since the meaning of this system had become clear to him, that the\naim of his energy was a most unworthy one.",
      "In reality, what was the\nstruggle about?",
      "He was struggling for every farthing of his share (and\nhe could not help it, for he had only to relax his efforts, and he\nwould not have had the money to pay his laborers  wages), while they\nwere only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably,\nthat is to say, as they were used to doing it.",
      "It was for his interests\nthat every laborer should work as hard as possible, and that while\ndoing so he should keep his wits about him, so as to try not to break\nthe winnowing machines, the horse rakes, the thrashing machines, that\nhe should attend to what he was doing.",
      "What the laborer wanted was to\nwork as pleasantly as possible, with rests, and above all, carelessly\nand heedlessly, without thinking.",
      "That summer Levin saw this at every\nstep.",
      "He sent the men to mow some clover for hay, picking out the worst\npatches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no\nuse for seed; again and again they mowed the best acres of clover,\njustifying themselves by the pretense that the bailiff had told them\nto, and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would be\nsplendid hay; but he knew that it was owing to those acres being so\nmuch easier to mow.",
      "He sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it\nwas broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to\nsit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him.",
      "And he\nwas told,  Don t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch\nit quick enough.",
      "The ploughs were practically useless, because it\nnever occurred to the laborer to raise the share when he turned the\nplough, and forcing it round, he strained the horses and tore up the\nground, and Levin was begged not to mind about it.",
      "The horses were\nallowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer would\nconsent to be night-watchman, and in spite of orders to the contrary,\nthe laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty, and Ivan, after\nworking all day long, fell asleep, and was very penitent for his fault,\nsaying,  Do what you will to me, your honor.",
      "They killed three of the best calves by letting them into the clover\naftermath without care as to their drinking, and nothing would make the\nmen believe that they had been blown out by the clover, but they told\nhim, by way of consolation, that one of his neighbors had lost a\nhundred and twelve head of cattle in three days.",
      "All this happened, not\nbecause anyone felt ill-will to Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he\nknew that they liked him, thought him a simple gentleman (their highest\npraise); but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work\nmerrily and carelessly, and his interests were not only remote and\nincomprehensible to them, but fatally opposed to their most just\nclaims.",
      "Long before, Levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own\nposition in regard to the land.",
      "He saw where his boat leaked, but he\ndid not look for the leak, perhaps purposely deceiving himself.",
      "(Nothing would be left him if he lost faith in it.)",
      "But now he could\ndeceive himself no longer.",
      "The farming of the land, as he was managing\nit, had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him, and he\ncould take no further interest in it.",
      "To this now was joined the presence, only twenty-five miles off, of\nKitty Shtcherbatskaya, whom he longed to see and could not see.",
      "Darya\nAlexandrovna Oblonskaya had invited him, when he was over there, to\ncome; to come with the object of renewing his offer to her sister, who\nwould, so she gave him to understand, accept him now.",
      "Levin himself had\nfelt on seeing Kitty Shtcherbatskaya that he had never ceased to love\nher; but he could not go over to the Oblonskys , knowing she was there.",
      "The fact that he had made her an offer, and she had refused him, had\nplaced an insuperable barrier between her and him.",
      "I can t ask her to\nbe my wife merely because she can t be the wife of the man she wanted\nto marry,  he said to himself.",
      "The thought of this made him cold and\nhostile to her.",
      "I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling\nof reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will\nonly hate me all the more, as she s bound to.",
      "And besides, how can I\nnow, after what Darya Alexandrovna told me, go to see them?",
      "Can I help\nshowing that I know what she told me?",
      "And me to go magnanimously to\nforgive her, and have pity on her!",
      "Me go through a performance before\nher of forgiving, and deigning to bestow my love on her!...",
      "What\ninduced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that?",
      "By chance I might have seen\nher, then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it s\nout of the question, out of the question!",
      "Darya Alexandrovna sent him a letter, asking him for a side-saddle for\nKitty s use.",
      "I m told you have a side-saddle,  she wrote to him;  I\nhope you will bring it over yourself.",
      "This was more than he could stand.",
      "How could a woman of any\nintelligence, of any delicacy, put her sister in such a humiliating\nposition!",
      "He wrote ten notes, and tore them all up, and sent the saddle\nwithout any reply.",
      "To write that he would go was impossible, because he\ncould not go; to write that he could not come because something\nprevented him, or that he would be away, that was still worse.",
      "He sent\nthe saddle without an answer, and with a sense of having done something\nshameful; he handed over all the now revolting business of the estate\nto the bailiff, and set off next day to a remote district to see his\nfriend Sviazhsky, who had splendid marshes for grouse in his\nneighborhood, and had lately written to ask him to keep a long-standing\npromise to stay with him.",
      "The grouse-marsh, in the Surovsky district,\nhad long tempted Levin, but he had continually put off this visit on\naccount of his work on the estate.",
      "Now he was glad to get away from the\nneighborhood of the Shtcherbatskys, and still more from his farm work,\nespecially on a shooting expedition, which always in trouble served as\nthe best consolation.",
      "Chapter 25\n\nIn the Surovsky district there was no railway nor service of post\nhorses, and Levin drove there with his own horses in his big,\nold-fashioned carriage.",
      "He stopped halfway at a well-to-do peasant s to feed his horses.",
      "A\nbald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his\ncheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the\nthree horses pass.",
      "Directing the coachman to a place under the shed in\nthe big, clean, tidy yard, with charred, old-fashioned ploughs in it,\nthe old man asked Levin to come into the parlor.",
      "A cleanly dressed\nyoung woman, with clogs on her bare feet, was scrubbing the floor in\nthe new outer room.",
      "She was frightened of the dog, that ran in after\nLevin, and uttered a shriek, but began laughing at her own fright at\nonce when she was told the dog would not hurt her.",
      "Pointing Levin with\nher bare arm to the door into the parlor, she bent down again, hiding\nher handsome face, and went on scrubbing.",
      "Would you like the samovar?",
      "she asked.",
      "Yes, please.",
      "The parlor was a big room, with a Dutch stove, and a screen dividing it\ninto two.",
      "Under the holy pictures stood a table painted in patterns, a\nbench, and two chairs.",
      "Near the entrance was a dresser full of\ncrockery.",
      "The shutters were closed, there were few flies, and it was so\nclean that Levin was anxious that Laska, who had been running along the\nroad and bathing in puddles, should not muddy the floor, and ordered\nher to a place in the corner by the door.",
      "After looking round the\nparlor, Levin went out in the back yard.",
      "The good-looking young woman\nin clogs, swinging the empty pails on the yoke, ran on before him to\nthe well for water.",
      "Look sharp, my girl!",
      "the old man shouted after her, good-humoredly,\nand he went up to Levin.",
      "Well, sir, are you going to Nikolay\nIvanovitch Sviazhsky?",
      "His honor comes to us too,  he began, chatting,\nleaning his elbows on the railing of the steps.",
      "In the middle of the\nold man s account of his acquaintance with Sviazhsky, the gates creaked\nagain, and laborers came into the yard from the fields, with wooden\nploughs and harrows.",
      "The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows\nwere sleek and fat.",
      "The laborers were obviously of the household: two\nwere young men in cotton shirts and caps, the two others were hired\nlaborers in homespun shirts, one an old man, the other a young fellow.",
      "Moving off from the steps, the old man went up to the horses and began\nunharnessing them.",
      "What have they been ploughing?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Ploughing up the potatoes.",
      "We rent a bit of land too.",
      "Fedot, don t let\nout the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we ll put the other in\nharness.",
      "Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he brought them along?",
      "asked the big, healthy-looking fellow, obviously the old man s son.",
      "There ... in the outer room,  answered the old man, bundling together\nthe harness he had taken off, and flinging it on the ground.",
      "You can\nput them on, while they have dinner.",
      "The good-looking young woman came into the outer room with the full\npails dragging at her shoulders.",
      "More women came on the scene from\nsomewhere, young and handsome, middle-aged, old and ugly, with children\nand without children.",
      "The samovar was beginning to sing; the laborers and the family, having\ndisposed of the horses, came in to dinner.",
      "Levin, getting his\nprovisions out of his carriage, invited the old man to take tea with\nhim.",
      "Well, I have had some today already,  said the old man, obviously\naccepting the invitation with pleasure.",
      "But just a glass for company.",
      "Over their tea Levin heard all about the old man s farming.",
      "Ten years\nbefore, the old man had rented three hundred acres from the lady who\nowned them, and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three\nhundred from a neighboring landowner.",
      "A small part of the land the\nworst part he let out for rent, while a hundred acres of arable land he\ncultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers.",
      "The old man\ncomplained that things were doing badly.",
      "But Levin saw that he simply\ndid so from a feeling of propriety, and that his farm was in a\nflourishing condition.",
      "If it had been unsuccessful he would not have\nbought land at thirty-five roubles the acre, he would not have married\nhis three sons and a nephew, he would not have rebuilt twice after\nfires, and each time on a larger scale.",
      "In spite of the old man s\ncomplaints, it was evident that he was proud, and justly proud, of his\nprosperity, proud of his sons, his nephew, his sons  wives, his horses\nand his cows, and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this\nfarming going.",
      "From his conversation with the old man, Levin thought he\nwas not averse to new methods either.",
      "He had planted a great many\npotatoes, and his potatoes, as Levin had seen driving past, were\nalready past flowering and beginning to die down, while Levin s were\nonly just coming into flower.",
      "He earthed up his potatoes with a modern\nplough borrowed from a neighboring landowner.",
      "He sowed wheat.",
      "The\ntrifling fact that, thinning out his rye, the old man used the rye he\nthinned out for his horses, specially struck Levin.",
      "How many times had\nLevin seen this splendid fodder wasted, and tried to get it saved; but\nalways it had turned out to be impossible.",
      "The peasant got this done,\nand he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts.",
      "What have the wenches to do?",
      "They carry it out in bundles to the\nroadside, and the cart brings it away.",
      "Well, we landowners can t manage well with our laborers,  said Levin,\nhanding him a glass of tea.",
      "Thank you,  said the old man, and he took the glass, but refused\nsugar, pointing to a lump he had left.",
      "They re simple destruction, \nsaid he.",
      "Look at Sviazhsky s, for instance.",
      "We know what the land s\nlike first-rate, yet there s not much of a crop to boast of.",
      "It s not\nlooked after enough that s all it is!",
      "But you work your land with hired laborers?",
      "We re all peasants together.",
      "We go into everything ourselves.",
      "If a\nman s no use, he can go, and we can manage by ourselves.",
      "Father, Finogen wants some tar,  said the young woman in the clogs,\ncoming in.",
      "Yes, yes, that s how it is, sir!",
      "said the old man, getting up, and\ncrossing himself deliberately, he thanked Levin and went out.",
      "When Levin went into the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole\nfamily at dinner.",
      "The women were standing up waiting on them.",
      "The\nyoung, sturdy-looking son was telling something funny with his mouth\nfull of pudding, and they were all laughing, the woman in the clogs,\nwho was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl, laughing most merrily of all.",
      "Very probably the good-looking face of the young woman in the clogs had\na good deal to do with the impression of well-being this peasant\nhousehold made upon Levin, but the impression was so strong that Levin\ncould never get rid of it.",
      "And all the way from the old peasant s to\nSviazhsky s he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were\nsomething in this impression that demanded his special attention.",
      "Chapter 26\n\nSviazhsky was the marshal of his district.",
      "He was five years older than\nLevin, and had long been married.",
      "His sister-in-law, a young girl Levin\nliked very much, lived in his house; and Levin knew that Sviazhsky and\nhis wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him.",
      "He knew\nthis with certainty, as so-called eligible young men always know it,\nthough he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone;\nand he knew too that, although he wanted to get married, and although\nby every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife,\nhe could no more have married her, even if he had not been in love with\nKitty Shtcherbatskaya, than he could have flown up to the sky.",
      "And this\nknowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to\nSviazhsky.",
      "On getting Sviazhsky s letter with the invitation for shooting, Levin\nhad immediately thought of this; but in spite of it he had made up his\nmind that Sviazhsky s having such views for him was simply his own\ngroundless supposition, and so he would go, all the same.",
      "Besides, at\nthe bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself, put himself to\nthe test in regard to this girl.",
      "The Sviazhskys  home-life was\nexceedingly pleasant, and Sviazhsky himself, the best type of man\ntaking part in local affairs that Levin knew, was very interesting to\nhim.",
      "Sviazhsky was one of those people, always a source of wonder to Levin,\nwhose convictions, very logical though never original, go one way by\nthemselves, while their life, exceedingly definite and firm in its\ndirection, goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct\ncontradiction to their convictions.",
      "Sviazhsky was an extremely advanced\nman.",
      "He despised the nobility, and believed the mass of the nobility to\nbe secretly in favor of serfdom, and only concealing their views from\ncowardice.",
      "He regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the\nstyle of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he never\npermitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a\nfunctionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and\nwhen he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap\nwith the red band.",
      "He considered human life only tolerable abroad, and\nwent abroad to stay at every opportunity, and at the same time he\ncarried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in Russia, and\nwith extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was\nbeing done in Russia.",
      "He considered the Russian peasant as occupying a\nstage of development intermediate between the ape and the man, and at\nthe same time in the local assemblies no one was readier to shake hands\nwith the peasants and listen to their opinion.",
      "He believed neither in\nGod nor the devil, but was much concerned about the question of the\nimprovement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues, and\ntook special trouble to keep up the church in his village.",
      "On the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of\ncomplete liberty for women, and especially their right to labor.",
      "But he\nlived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless\nhome life was the admiration of everyone, and arranged his wife s life\nso that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her husband s\nefforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as\npossible.",
      "If it had not been a characteristic of Levin s to put the most\nfavorable interpretation on people, Sviazhsky s character would have\npresented no doubt or difficulty to him: he would have said to himself,\n a fool or a knave,  and everything would have seemed clear.",
      "But he\ncould not say  a fool,  because Sviazhsky was unmistakably clever, and\nmoreover, a highly cultivated man, who was exceptionally modest over\nhis culture.",
      "There was not a subject he knew nothing of.",
      "But he did not\ndisplay his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so.",
      "Still less\ncould Levin say that he was a knave, as Sviazhsky was unmistakably an\nhonest, good-hearted, sensible man, who worked good-humoredly, keenly,\nand perseveringly at his work; he was held in high honor by everyone\nabout him, and certainly he had never consciously done, and was indeed\nincapable of doing, anything base.",
      "Levin tried to understand him, and could not understand him, and looked\nat him and his life as at a living enigma.",
      "Levin and he were very friendly, and so Levin used to venture to sound\nSviazhsky, to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life;\nbut it was always in vain.",
      "Every time Levin tried to penetrate beyond\nthe outer chambers of Sviazhsky s mind, which were hospitably open to\nall, he noticed that Sviazhsky was slightly disconcerted; faint signs\nof alarm were visible in his eyes, as though he were afraid Levin would\nunderstand him, and he would give him a kindly, good-humored repulse.",
      "Just now, since his disenchantment with farming, Levin was particularly\nglad to stay with Sviazhsky.",
      "Apart from the fact that the sight of this\nhappy and affectionate couple, so pleased with themselves and everyone\nelse, and their well-ordered home had always a cheering effect on\nLevin, he felt a longing, now that he was so dissatisfied with his own\nlife, to get at that secret in Sviazhsky that gave him such clearness,\ndefiniteness, and good courage in life.",
      "Moreover, Levin knew that at\nSviazhsky s he should meet the landowners of the neighborhood, and it\nwas particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in\nthose rural conversations concerning crops, laborers  wages, and so on,\nwhich, he was aware, are conventionally regarded as something very low,\nbut which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of\nimportance.",
      "It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom,\nand it may not be of importance in England.",
      "In both cases the\nconditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now,\nwhen everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking\nshape, the question what form these conditions will take is the one\nquestion of importance in Russia,  thought Levin.",
      "The shooting turned out to be worse than Levin had expected.",
      "The marsh\nwas dry and there were no grouse at all.",
      "He walked about the whole day\nand only brought back three birds, but to make up for that he brought\nback, as he always did from shooting, an excellent appetite, excellent\nspirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him always\naccompanied violent physical exertion.",
      "And while out shooting, when he\nseemed to be thinking of nothing at all, suddenly the old man and his\nfamily kept coming back to his mind, and the impression of them seemed\nto claim not merely his attention, but the solution of some question\nconnected with them.",
      "In the evening at tea, two landowners who had come about some business\nconnected with a wardship were of the party, and the interesting\nconversation Levin had been looking forward to sprang up.",
      "Levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table, and was obliged\nto keep up a conversation with her and her sister, who was sitting\nopposite him.",
      "Madame Sviazhskaya was a round-faced, fair-haired, rather\nshort woman, all smiles and dimples.",
      "Levin tried through her to get a\nsolution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind; but\nhe had not complete freedom of ideas, because he was in an agony of\nembarrassment.",
      "This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the\nsister-in-law was sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put\non, as he fancied, for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape\nof a trapeze, on her white bosom.",
      "This quadrangular opening, in spite\nof the bosom s being very white, or just because it was very white,\ndeprived Levin of the full use of his faculties.",
      "He imagined, probably\nmistakenly, that this low-necked bodice had been made on his account,\nand felt that he had no right to look at it, and tried not to look at\nit; but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the\nlow-necked bodice having been made.",
      "It seemed to Levin that he had\ndeceived someone, that he ought to explain something, but that to\nexplain it was impossible, and for that reason he was continually\nblushing, was ill at ease and awkward.",
      "His awkwardness infected the\npretty sister-in-law too.",
      "But their hostess appeared not to observe\nthis, and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation.",
      "You say,  she said, pursuing the subject that had been started,  that\nmy husband cannot be interested in what s Russian.",
      "It s quite the\ncontrary; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad, but not as he is\nhere.",
      "Here, he feels in his proper place.",
      "He has so much to do, and he\nhas the faculty of interesting himself in everything.",
      "Oh, you ve not\nbeen to see our school, have you?",
      "I ve seen it....",
      "The little house covered with ivy, isn t it?",
      "Yes; that s Nastia s work,  she said, indicating her sister.",
      "You teach in it yourself?",
      "asked Levin, trying to look above the open\nneck, but feeling that wherever he looked in that direction he should\nsee it.",
      "Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we have a\nfirst-rate schoolmistress now.",
      "And we ve started gymnastic exercises.",
      "No, thank you, I won t have any more tea,  said Levin, and conscious\nof doing a rude thing, but incapable of continuing the conversation, he\ngot up, blushing.",
      "I hear a very interesting conversation,  he added,\nand walked to the other end of the table, where Sviazhsky was sitting\nwith the two gentlemen of the neighborhood.",
      "Sviazhsky was sitting\nsideways, with one elbow on the table, and a cup in one hand, while\nwith the other hand he gathered up his beard, held it to his nose and\nlet it drop again, as though he were smelling it.",
      "His brilliant black\neyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray\nwhiskers, and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks.",
      "The\ngentleman was complaining of the peasants.",
      "It was evident to Levin that\nSviazhsky knew an answer to this gentleman s complaints, which would at\nonce demolish his whole contention, but that in his position he could\nnot give utterance to this answer, and listened, not without pleasure,\nto the landowner s comic speeches.",
      "The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate\nadherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his\nlife in the country.",
      "Levin saw proofs of this in his dress, in the\nold-fashioned threadbare coat, obviously not his everyday attire, in\nhis shrewd, deep-set eyes, in his idiomatic, fluent Russian, in the\nimperious tone that had become habitual from long use, and in the\nresolute gestures of his large, red, sunburnt hands, with an old\nbetrothal ring on the little finger.",
      "Chapter 27\n\n If I d only the heart to throw up what s been set going ... such a lot\nof trouble wasted ...",
      "I d turn my back on the whole business, sell up,\ngo off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _La Belle H l ne_,  said the\nlandowner, a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face.",
      "But you see you don t throw it up,  said Nikolay Ivanovitch Sviazhsky;\n so there must be something gained.",
      "The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor\nhired.",
      "Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense.",
      "Though,\ninstead of that, you d never believe it the drunkenness, the\nimmorality!",
      "They keep chopping and changing their bits of land.",
      "Not a\nsight of a horse or a cow.",
      "The peasant s dying of hunger, but just go\nand take him on as a laborer, he ll do his best to do you a mischief,\nand then bring you up before the justice of the peace.",
      "But then you make complaints to the justice too,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "I lodge complaints?",
      "Not for anything in the world!",
      "Such a talking, and\nsuch a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it.",
      "At the works, for\ninstance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off.",
      "What did the\njustice do?",
      "Why, acquitted them.",
      "Nothing keeps them in order but their\nown communal court and their village elder.",
      "He ll flog them in the good\nold style!",
      "But for that there d be nothing for it but to give it all up\nand run away.",
      "Obviously the landowner was chaffing Sviazhsky, who, far from resenting\nit, was apparently amused by it.",
      "But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures,  said\nhe, smiling:  Levin and I and this gentleman.",
      "He indicated the other landowner.",
      "Yes, the thing s done at Mihail Petrovitch s, but ask him how it s\ndone.",
      "Do you call that a rational system?",
      "said the landowner,\nobviously rather proud of the word  rational.",
      "My system s very simple,  said Mihail Petrovitch,  thank God.",
      "All my\nmanagement rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and\nthe peasants come to me,  Father, master, help us!",
      "Well, the peasants\nare all one s neighbors; one feels for them.",
      "So one advances them a\nthird, but one says:  Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must\nhelp me when I need it whether it s the sowing of the oats, or the\nhaycutting, or the harvest ; and well, one agrees, so much for each\ntaxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too, it s true.",
      "Levin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods,\nexchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch,\nturning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers.",
      "Then what do you think?",
      "he asked;  what system is one to adopt\nnowadays?",
      "Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the crop\nor for rent to the peasants; that one can do only that s just how the\ngeneral prosperity of the country is being ruined.",
      "Where the land with\nserf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one, on the\nhalf-crop system it yields three to one.",
      "Russia has been ruined by the\nemancipation!",
      "Sviazhsky looked with smiling eyes at Levin, and even made a faint\ngesture of irony to him; but Levin did not think the landowner s words\nabsurd, he understood them better than he did Sviazhsky.",
      "A great deal\nmore of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what\nway Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very\ntrue, new to him, and quite incontestable.",
      "The landowner unmistakably\nspoke his own individual thought a thing that very rarely happens and a\nthought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some\nexercise for an idle brain, but a thought which had grown up out of the\nconditions of his life, which he had brooded over in the solitude of\nhis village, and had considered in every aspect.",
      "The point is, don t you see, that progress of every sort is only made\nby the use of authority,  he said, evidently wishing to show he was not\nwithout culture.",
      "Take the reforms of Peter, of Catherine, of\nAlexander.",
      "Take European history.",
      "And progress in agriculture more than\nanything else the potato, for instance, that was introduced among us by\nforce.",
      "The wooden plough too wasn t always used.",
      "It was introduced\nmaybe in the days before the Empire, but it was probably brought in by\nforce.",
      "Now, in our own day, we landowners in the serf times used\nvarious improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing\nmachines, and carting manure and all the modern implements all that we\nbrought into use by our authority, and the peasants opposed it at\nfirst, and ended by imitating us.",
      "Now, by the abolition of serfdom we\nhave been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry, where it had\nbeen raised to a high level, is bound to sink to the most savage\nprimitive condition.",
      "That s how I see it.",
      "But why so?",
      "If it s rational, you ll be able to keep up the same\nsystem with hired labor,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "We ve no power over them.",
      "With whom am I going to work the system,\nallow me to ask?",
      "There it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture,  thought\nLevin.",
      "With laborers.",
      "The laborers won t work well, and won t work with good implements.",
      "Our\nlaborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig, and when he s drunk he\nruins everything you give him.",
      "He makes the horses ill with too much\nwater, cuts good harness, barters the tires of the wheels for drink,\ndrops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so as to break it.",
      "He\nloathes the sight of anything that s not after his fashion.",
      "And that s\nhow it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.",
      "Lands gone out of\ncultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and\nwhere millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the\nwealth of the country has decreased.",
      "If the same thing had been done,\nbut with care that.... \n\nAnd he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of\nwhich these drawbacks might have been avoided.",
      "This did not interest Levin, but when he had finished, Levin went back\nto his first position, and, addressing Sviazhsky, and trying to draw\nhim into expressing his serious opinion: \n\n That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present\nrelations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a\nrational system to yield a profit that s perfectly true,  said he.",
      "I don t believe it,  Sviazhsky replied quite seriously;  all I see is\nthat we don t know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of\nagriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low.",
      "We\nhave no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don t\neven know how to keep accounts.",
      "Ask any landowner; he won t be able to\ntell you what crop s profitable, and what s not.",
      "Italian bookkeeping,  said the gentleman of the gray whiskers\nironically.",
      "You may keep your books as you like, but if they spoil\neverything for you, there won t be any profit.",
      "Why do they spoil things?",
      "A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian\npresser, they will break, but my steam press they don t break.",
      "A\nwretched Russian nag they ll ruin, but keep good dray-horses they won t\nruin them.",
      "And so it is all round.",
      "We must raise our farming to a\nhigher level.",
      "Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch!",
      "It s all\nvery well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the university,\nlads to be educated at the high school how am I going to buy these\ndray-horses?",
      "Well, that s what the land banks are for.",
      "To get what s left me sold by auction?",
      "No, thank you.",
      "I don t agree that it s necessary or possible to raise the level of\nagriculture still higher,  said Levin.",
      "I devote myself to it, and I\nhave means, but I can do nothing.",
      "As to the banks, I don t know to whom\nthey re any good.",
      "For my part, anyway, whatever I ve spent money on in\nthe way of husbandry, it has been a loss: stock a loss, machinery a\nloss.",
      "That s true enough,  the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in,\npositively laughing with satisfaction.",
      "And I m not the only one,  pursued Levin.",
      "I mix with all the\nneighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational\nsystem; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss.",
      "Come,\ntell us how does your land do does it pay?",
      "said Levin, and at once in\nSviazhsky s eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he\nhad noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer\nchambers of Sviazhsky s mind.",
      "Moreover, this question on Levin s part was not quite in good faith.",
      "Madame Sviazhskaya had just told him at tea that they had that summer\ninvited a German expert in bookkeeping from Moscow, who for a\nconsideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management\nof their property, and found that it was costing them a loss of three\nthousand odd roubles.",
      "She did not remember the precise sum, but it\nappeared that the German had worked it out to the fraction of a\nfarthing.",
      "The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of\nSviazhsky s farming, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and\nmarshal was likely to be making.",
      "Possibly it does not pay,  answered Sviazhsky.",
      "That merely proves\neither that I m a bad manager, or that I ve sunk my capital for the\nincrease of my rents.",
      "Oh, rent!",
      "Levin cried with horror.",
      "Rent there may be in Europe,\nwhere land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all\nthe land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words\nthey re working it out; so there s no question of rent.",
      "How no rent?",
      "It s a law.",
      "Then we re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply\nmuddles us.",
      "No, tell me how there can be a theory of rent?...",
      "Will you have some junket?",
      "Masha, pass us some junket or raspberries.",
      "He turned to his wife.",
      "Extraordinarily late the raspberries are\nlasting this year.",
      "And in the happiest frame of mind Sviazhsky got up and walked off,\napparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point\nwhen to Levin it seemed that it was only just beginning.",
      "Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the\ngray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the\ndifficulty arises from the fact that we don t find out the\npeculiarities and habits of our laborer; but the landowner, like all\nmen who think independently and in isolation, was slow in taking in any\nother person s idea, and particularly partial to his own.",
      "He stuck to\nit that the Russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness, and that\nto get him out of his swinishness one must have authority, and there is\nnone; one must have the stick, and we have become so liberal that we\nhave all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand\nyears by lawyers and model prisons, where the worthless, stinking\npeasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of\nair.",
      "What makes you think,  said Levin, trying to get back to the question,\n that it s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the\nlabor would become productive?",
      "That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we ve no power over\nthem,  answered the landowner.",
      "How can new conditions be found?",
      "said Sviazhsky.",
      "Having eaten some\njunket and lighted a cigarette, he came back to the discussion.",
      "All\npossible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied, \nhe said.",
      "The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each\nguarantee for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been\nabolished there remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed\nand ready made, and must be adopted.",
      "Permanent hands, day-laborers,\nrammers you can t get out of those forms.",
      "But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.",
      "Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones.",
      "And will find them, in all\nprobability.",
      "That s just what I was meaning,  answered Levin.",
      "Why shouldn t we\nseek them for ourselves?",
      "Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for\nconstructing railways.",
      "They are ready, invented.",
      "But if they don t do for us, if they re stupid?",
      "said Levin.",
      "And again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of Sviazhsky.",
      "Oh, yes; we ll bury the world under our caps!",
      "We ve found the secret\nEurope was seeking for!",
      "I ve heard all that; but, excuse me, do you\nknow all that s been done in Europe on the question of the organization\nof labor?",
      "No, very little.",
      "That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe.",
      "The\nSchulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of\nthe labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the\nMulhausen experiment?",
      "That s a fact by now, as you re probably aware.",
      "I have some idea of it, but very vague.",
      "No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do.",
      "I m not a professor of sociology, of course, but it interested me, and\nreally, if it interests you, you ought to study it.",
      "But what conclusion have they come to?",
      "Excuse me....",
      "The two neighbors had risen, and Sviazhsky, once more checking Levin in\nhis inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer\nchambers of his mind, went to see his guests out.",
      "Chapter 28\n\nLevin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies; he was\nstirred as he had never been before by the idea that the\ndissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was\nnot an exceptional case, but the general condition of things in Russia;\nthat the organization of some relation of the laborers to the soil in\nwhich they would work, as with the peasant he had met half-way to the\nSviazhskys , was not a dream, but a problem which must be solved.",
      "And\nit seemed to him that the problem could be solved, and that he ought to\ntry and solve it.",
      "After saying good-night to the ladies, and promising to stay the whole\nof the next day, so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to\nsee an interesting ruin in the crown forest, Levin went, before going\nto bed, into his host s study to get the books on the labor question\nthat Sviazhsky had offered him.",
      "Sviazhsky s study was a huge room,\nsurrounded by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive\nwriting-table, standing in the middle of the room, and the other a\nround table, covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in\ndifferent languages, ranged like the rays of a star round the lamp.",
      "On\nthe writing-table was a stand of drawers marked with gold lettering,\nand full of papers of various sorts.",
      "Sviazhsky took out the books, and sat down in a rocking-chair.",
      "What are you looking at there?",
      "he said to Levin, who was standing at\nthe round table looking through the reviews.",
      "Oh, yes, there s a very interesting article here,  said Sviazhsky of\nthe review Levin was holding in his hand.",
      "It appears,  he went on,\nwith eager interest,  that Friedrich was not, after all, the person\nchiefly responsible for the partition of Poland.",
      "It is proved.... \n\nAnd with his characteristic clearness, he summed up those new, very\nimportant, and interesting revelations.",
      "Although Levin was engrossed at\nthe moment by his ideas about the problem of the land, he wondered, as\nhe heard Sviazhsky:  What is there inside of him?",
      "And why, why is he\ninterested in the partition of Poland?",
      "When Sviazhsky had finished,\nLevin could not help asking:  Well, and what then?",
      "But there was\nnothing to follow.",
      "It was simply interesting that it had been proved to\nbe so and so.",
      "But Sviazhsky did not explain, and saw no need to explain\nwhy it was interesting to him.",
      "Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,  said\nLevin, sighing.",
      "He s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.",
      "Oh, get along with you!",
      "An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart,\nlike all of them!",
      "said Sviazhsky.",
      "Whose marshal you are.",
      "Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction,  said Sviazhsky,\nlaughing.",
      "I ll tell you what interests me very much,  said Levin.",
      "He s right\nthat our system, that s to say of rational farming, doesn t answer,\nthat the only thing that answers is the money-lender system, like that\nmeek-looking gentleman s, or else the very simplest.... Whose fault is\nit?",
      "Our own, of course.",
      "Besides, it s not true that it doesn t answer.",
      "It\nanswers with Vassiltchikov.",
      "A factory....",
      "But I really don t know what it is you are surprised at.",
      "The people\nare at such a low stage of rational and moral development, that it s\nobvious they re bound to oppose everything that s strange to them.",
      "In\nEurope, a rational system answers because the people are educated; it\nfollows that we must educate the people that s all.",
      "But how are we to educate the people?",
      "To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and schools,\nand schools.",
      "But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material\ndevelopment: what help are schools for that?",
      "Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given to the\nsick man You should try purgative medicine.",
      "Taken: worse.",
      "Try leeches.",
      "Tried them: worse.",
      "Well, then, there s nothing left but to pray to God.",
      "Tried it: worse.",
      "That s just how it is with us.",
      "I say political\neconomy; you say worse.",
      "I say socialism: worse.",
      "Education: worse.",
      "But how do schools help matters?",
      "They give the peasant fresh wants.",
      "Well, that s a thing I ve never understood,  Levin replied with heat.",
      "In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their\nmaterial position?",
      "You say schools, education, will give them fresh\nwants.",
      "So much the worse, since they won t be capable of satisfying\nthem.",
      "And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the\ncatechism is going to improve their material condition, I never could\nmake out.",
      "The day before yesterday, I met a peasant woman in the\nevening with a little baby, and asked her where she was going.",
      "She said\nshe was going to the wise woman; her boy had screaming fits, so she was\ntaking him to be doctored.",
      "I asked,  Why, how does the wise woman cure\nscreaming fits?",
      "She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some\ncharm.... \n\n Well, you re saying it yourself!",
      "What s wanted to prevent her taking\nher child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just.... \nSviazhsky said, smiling good-humoredly.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "said Levin with annoyance;  that method of doctoring I merely\nmeant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools.",
      "The people are\npoor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the\nbaby is ill because it screams.",
      "But in what way this trouble of poverty\nand ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how\nthe hen-roost affects the screaming.",
      "What has to be cured is what makes\nhim poor.",
      "Well, in that, at least, you re in agreement with Spencer, whom you\ndislike so much.",
      "He says, too, that education may be the consequence of\ngreater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing, as he says,\nbut not of being able to read and write.... \n\n Well, then, I m very glad or the contrary, very sorry, that I m in\nagreement with Spencer; only I ve known it a long while.",
      "Schools can do\nno good; what will do good is an economic organization in which the\npeople will become richer, will have more leisure and then there will\nbe schools.",
      "Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.",
      "And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "But there was a gleam of alarm in Sviazhsky s eyes, and he said\nsmiling:\n\n No; that screaming story is positively capital!",
      "Did you really hear it\nyourself?",
      "Levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this man s\nlife and his thoughts.",
      "Obviously he did not care in the least what his\nreasoning led him to; all he wanted was the process of reasoning.",
      "And\nhe did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a\nblind alley.",
      "That was the only thing he disliked, and avoided by\nchanging the conversation to something agreeable and amusing.",
      "All the impressions of the day, beginning with the impression made by\nthe old peasant, which served, as it were, as the fundamental basis of\nall the conceptions and ideas of the day, threw Levin into violent\nexcitement.",
      "This dear good Sviazhsky, keeping a stock of ideas simply\nfor social purposes, and obviously having some other principles hidden\nfrom Levin, while with the crowd, whose name is legion, he guided\npublic opinion by ideas he did not share; that irascible country\ngentleman, perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been\nworried into by life, but wrong in his exasperation against a whole\nclass, and that the best class in Russia; his own dissatisfaction with\nthe work he had been doing, and the vague hope of finding a remedy for\nall this all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil, and anticipation\nof some solution near at hand.",
      "Left alone in the room assigned him, lying on a spring mattress that\nyielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg, Levin did\nnot fall asleep for a long while.",
      "Not one conversation with Sviazhsky,\nthough he had said a great deal that was clever, had interested Levin;\nbut the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration.",
      "Levin could not help recalling every word he had said, and in\nimagination amending his own replies.",
      "Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does not\nanswer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be\nforced on him by authority.",
      "If no system of husbandry answered at all\nwithout these improvements, you would be quite right.",
      "But the only\nsystem that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with\nhis habits, just as on the old peasant s land half-way here.",
      "Your and\nour general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to\nblame or the laborers.",
      "We have gone our way the European way a long\nwhile, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.",
      "Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but\nas the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our\nsystem of culture in accordance with that.",
      "Imagine, I ought to have\nsaid to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that\nyou have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the\nsuccess of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of\nimprovements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting\nthe soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before.",
      "Divide it\nin halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will\nbe greater, and the share of labor will be greater too.",
      "And to do this\none must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in\nits success.",
      "How to do this?",
      "that s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly\nit can be done.",
      "This idea threw Levin into a great excitement.",
      "He did not sleep half\nthe night, thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into\npractice.",
      "He had not intended to go away next day, but he now\ndetermined to go home early in the morning.",
      "Besides, the sister-in-law\nwith her low-necked bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and\nremorse for some utterly base action.",
      "Most important of all he must get\nback without delay: he would have to make haste to put his new project\nto the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat, so that the\nsowing might be undertaken on a new basis.",
      "He had made up his mind to\nrevolutionize his whole system.",
      "Chapter 29\n\nThe carrying out of Levin s plan presented many difficulties; but he\nstruggled on, doing his utmost, and attained a result which, though not\nwhat he desired, was enough to enable him, without self-deception, to\nbelieve that the attempt was worth the trouble.",
      "One of the chief\ndifficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full\nswing, that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again\nfrom the beginning, and the machine had to be mended while in motion.",
      "When on the evening that he arrived home he informed the bailiff of his\nplans, the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so\nlong as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time\nwas stupid and useless.",
      "The bailiff said that he had said so a long\nwhile ago, but no heed had been paid him.",
      "But as for the proposal made\nby Levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each\nagricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a\nprofound despondency, and offered no definite opinion, but began\nimmediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining\nsheaves of rye the next day, and of sending the men out for the second\nploughing, so that Levin felt that this was not the time for discussing\nit.",
      "On beginning to talk to the peasants about it, and making a proposition\nto cede them the land on new terms, he came into collision with the\nsame great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current\nwork of the day, that they had not time to consider the advantages and\ndisadvantages of the proposed scheme.",
      "The simple-hearted Ivan, the cowherd, seemed completely to grasp\nLevin s proposal that he should with his family take a share of the\nprofits of the cattle-yard and he was in complete sympathy with the\nplan.",
      "But when Levin hinted at the future advantages, Ivan s face\nexpressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say,\nand he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no\ndelay: he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens,\nor ran to get water or to clear out the dung.",
      "Another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasant that\na landowner s object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze\nall he could out of them.",
      "They were firmly convinced that his real aim\n(whatever he might say to them) would always be in what he did not say\nto them.",
      "And they themselves, in giving their opinion, said a great\ndeal but never said what was their real object.",
      "Moreover (Levin felt\nthat the irascible landowner had been right) the peasants made their\nfirst and unalterable condition of any agreement whatever that they\nshould not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind, nor to\nuse new implements.",
      "They agreed that the modern plough ploughed better,\nthat the scarifier did the work more quickly, but they found thousands\nof reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of\nthem; and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to\nlower the standard of cultivation, he felt sorry to give up improved\nmethods, the advantages of which were so obvious.",
      "But in spite of all\nthese difficulties he got his way, and by autumn the system was\nworking, or at least so it seemed to him.",
      "At first Levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land\njust as it was to the peasants, the laborers, and the bailiff on new\nconditions of partnership; but he was very soon convinced that this was\nimpossible, and determined to divide it up.",
      "The cattle-yard, the\ngarden, hay fields, and arable land, divided into several parts, had to\nbe made into separate lots.",
      "The simple-hearted cowherd, Ivan, who,\nLevin fancied, understood the matter better than any of them,\ncollecting together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his\nown family, became a partner in the cattle-yard.",
      "A distant part of the\nestate, a tract of waste land that had lain fallow for eight years, was\nwith the help of the clever carpenter, Fyodor Ryezunov, taken by six\nfamilies of peasants on new conditions of partnership, and the peasant\nShuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same\nterms.",
      "The remainder of the land was still worked on the old system,\nbut these three associated partnerships were the first step to a new\norganization of the whole, and they completely took up Levin s time.",
      "It is true that in the cattle-yard things went no better than before,\nand Ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made\nof fresh cream, affirming that cows require less food if kept cold, and\nthat butter is more profitable made from sour cream, and he asked for\nwages just as under the old system, and took not the slightest interest\nin the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out\nof his future share in the profits.",
      "It is true that Fyodor Ryezunov s company did not plough over the\nground twice before sowing, as had been agreed, justifying themselves\non the plea that the time was too short.",
      "It is true that the peasants\nof the same company, though they had agreed to work the land on new\nconditions, always spoke of the land, not as held in partnership, but\nas rented for half the crop, and more than once the peasants and\nRyezunov himself said to Levin,  If you would take a rent for the land,\nit would save you trouble, and we should be more free.",
      "Moreover the\nsame peasants kept putting off, on various excuses, the building of a\ncattleyard and barn on the land as agreed upon, and delayed doing it\ntill the winter.",
      "It is true that Shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens\nhe had undertaken in small lots to the peasants.",
      "He evidently quite\nmisunderstood, and apparently intentionally misunderstood, the\nconditions upon which the land had been given to him.",
      "Often, too, talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the\nadvantages of the plan, Levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but\nthe sound of his voice, and were firmly resolved, whatever he might\nsay, not to let themselves be taken in.",
      "He felt this especially when he\ntalked to the cleverest of the peasants, Ryezunov, and detected the\ngleam in Ryezunov s eyes which showed so plainly both ironical\namusement at Levin, and the firm conviction that, if anyone were to be\ntaken in, it would not be he, Ryezunov.",
      "But in spite of all this Levin\nthought the system worked, and that by keeping accounts strictly and\ninsisting on his own way, he would prove to them in the future the\nadvantages of the arrangement, and then the system would go of itself.",
      "These matters, together with the management of the land still left on\nhis hands, and the indoor work over his book, so engrossed Levin the\nwhole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting.",
      "At the end of\nAugust he heard that the Oblonskys had gone away to Moscow, from their\nservant who brought back the side-saddle.",
      "He felt that in not answering\nDarya Alexandrovna s letter he had by his rudeness, of which he could\nnot think without a flush of shame, burned his ships, and that he would\nnever go and see them again.",
      "He had been just as rude with the\nSviazhskys, leaving them without saying good-bye.",
      "But he would never go\nto see them again either.",
      "He did not care about that now.",
      "The business\nof reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as\nthough there would never be anything else in his life.",
      "He read the\nbooks lent him by Sviazhsky, and copying out what he had not got, he\nread both the economic and socialistic books on the subject, but, as he\nhad anticipated, found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken.",
      "In the books on political economy in Mill, for instance, whom he\nstudied first with great ardor, hoping every minute to find an answer\nto the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from\nthe condition of land culture in Europe; but he did not see why these\nlaws, which did not apply in Russia, must be general.",
      "He saw just the\nsame thing in the socialistic books: either they were the beautiful but\nimpracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student,\nor they were attempts at improving, rectifying the economic position in\nwhich Europe was placed, with which the system of land tenure in Russia\nhad nothing in common.",
      "Political economy told him that the laws by\nwhich the wealth of Europe had been developed, and was developing, were\nuniversal and unvarying.",
      "Socialism told him that development along\nthese lines leads to ruin.",
      "And neither of them gave an answer, or even\na hint, in reply to the question what he, Levin, and all the Russian\npeasants and landowners, were to do with their millions of hands and\nmillions of acres, to make them as productive as possible for the\ncommon weal.",
      "Having once taken the subject up, he read conscientiously everything\nbearing on it, and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land\nsystems on the spot, in order that he might not on this question be\nconfronted with what so often met him on various subjects.",
      "Often, just\nas he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was\ntalking to, and was beginning to explain his own, he would suddenly be\ntold:  But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli?",
      "You haven t\nread them: they ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.",
      "He saw now distinctly that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell\nhim.",
      "He knew what he wanted.",
      "He saw that Russia has splendid land,\nsplendid laborers, and that in certain cases, as at the peasant s on\nthe way to Sviazhsky s, the produce raised by the laborers and the land\nis great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the\nEuropean way the produce is small, and that this simply arises from the\nfact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own\npeculiar way, and that this antagonism is not incidental but\ninvariable, and has its roots in the national spirit.",
      "He thought that\nthe Russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast\ntracts of unoccupied land, consciously adhered, till all their land was\noccupied, to the methods suitable to their purpose, and that their\nmethods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed.",
      "And he\nwanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his\nland.",
      "Chapter 30\n\nAt the end of September the timber had been carted for building the\ncattleyard on the land that had been allotted to the association of\npeasants, and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits\ndivided.",
      "In practice the system worked capitally, or, at least, so it\nseemed to Levin.",
      "In order to work out the whole subject theoretically\nand to complete his book, which, in Levin s daydreams, was not merely\nto effect a revolution in political economy, but to annihilate that\nscience entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the\nrelation of the people to the soil, all that was left to do was to make\na tour abroad, and to study on the spot all that had been done in the\nsame direction, and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had\nbeen done there was not what was wanted.",
      "Levin was only waiting for the\ndelivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad.",
      "But\nthe rains began, preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes\nleft in the fields, and putting a stop to all work, even to the\ndelivery of the wheat.",
      "The mud was impassable along the roads; two mills were carried away,\nand the weather got worse and worse.",
      "On the 30th of September the sun came out in the morning, and hoping\nfor fine weather, Levin began making final preparations for his\njourney.",
      "He gave orders for the wheat to be delivered, sent the bailiff\nto the merchant to get the money owing him, and went out himself to\ngive some final directions on the estate before setting off.",
      "Having finished all his business, soaked through with the streams of\nwater which kept running down the leather behind his neck and his\ngaiters, but in the keenest and most confident temper, Levin returned\nhomewards in the evening.",
      "The weather had become worse than ever\ntowards evening; the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she\nwent along sideways, shaking her head and ears; but Levin was all right\nunder his hood, and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams\nrunning under the wheels, at the drops hanging on every bare twig, at\nthe whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the\nbridge, at the thick layer of still juicy, fleshy leaves that lay\nheaped up about the stripped elm-tree.",
      "In spite of the gloominess of\nnature around him, he felt peculiarly eager.",
      "The talks he had been\nhaving with the peasants in the further village had shown that they\nwere beginning to get used to their new position.",
      "The old servant to\nwhose hut he had gone to get dry evidently approved of Levin s plan,\nand of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership by the purchase\nof cattle.",
      "I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my\nend,  thought Levin;  and it s something to work and take trouble for.",
      "This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public\nwelfare comes into it.",
      "The whole system of culture, the chief element\nin the condition of the people, must be completely transformed.",
      "Instead\nof poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility,\nharmony and unity of interests.",
      "In short, a bloodless revolution, but a\nrevolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of\nour district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world.",
      "Because\na just idea cannot but be fruitful.",
      "Yes, it s an aim worth working for.",
      "And its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and\nwas refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such\na pitiful, worthless creature that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin\nfelt just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of\nhimself as a whole.",
      "That means nothing.",
      "And he too, most likely, had an\nAgafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets.",
      "Musing on such thoughts Levin reached home in the darkness.",
      "The bailiff, who had been to the merchant, had come back and brought\npart of the money for the wheat.",
      "An agreement had been made with the\nold servant, and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere\nthe corn was still standing in the fields, so that his one hundred and\nsixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with\nthe losses of others.",
      "After dinner Levin was sitting, as he usually did, in an easy chair\nwith a book, and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before\nhim in connection with his book.",
      "Today all the significance of his book\nrose before him with special distinctness, and whole periods ranged\nthemselves in his mind in illustration of his theories.",
      "I must write\nthat down,  he thought.",
      "That ought to form a brief introduction, which\nI thought unnecessary before.",
      "He got up to go to his writing-table,\nand Laska, lying at his feet, got up too, stretching and looking at him\nas though to inquire where to go.",
      "But he had not time to write it down,\nfor the head peasants had come round, and Levin went out into the hall\nto them.",
      "After his levee, that is to say, giving directions about the labors of\nthe next day, and seeing all the peasants who had business with him,\nLevin went back to his study and sat down to work.",
      "Laska lay under the table; Agafea Mihalovna settled herself in her\nplace with her stocking.",
      "After writing for a little while, Levin suddenly thought with\nexceptional vividness of Kitty, her refusal, and their last meeting.",
      "He\ngot up and began walking about the room.",
      "What s the use of being dreary?",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "Come, why do\nyou stay on at home?",
      "You ought to go to some warm springs, especially\nnow you re ready for the journey.",
      "Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must\nfinish my work.",
      "There, there, your work, you say!",
      "As if you hadn t done enough for the\npeasants!",
      "Why, as  tis, they re saying,  Your master will be getting\nsome honor from the Tsar for it.",
      "Indeed and it is a strange thing; why\nneed you worry about the peasants?",
      "I m not worrying about them; I m doing it for my own good.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna knew every detail of Levin s plans for his land.",
      "Levin\noften put his views before her in all their complexity, and not\nuncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments.",
      "But\non this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said.",
      "Of one s soul s salvation we all know and must think before all else, \nshe said with a sigh.",
      "Parfen Denisitch now, for all he was no scholar,\nhe died a death that God grant everyone of us the like,  she said,\nreferring to a servant who had died recently.",
      "Took the sacrament and\nall.",
      "That s not what I mean,  said he.",
      "I mean that I m acting for my own\nadvantage.",
      "It s all the better for me if the peasants do their work\nbetter.",
      "Well, whatever you do, if he s a lazy good-for-nought, everything ll\nbe at sixes and sevens.",
      "If he has a conscience, he ll work, and if not,\nthere s no doing anything.",
      "Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle\nbetter.",
      "All I say is,  answered Agafea Mihalovna, evidently not speaking at\nrandom, but in strict sequence of idea,  that you ought to get married,\nthat s what I say.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna s allusion to the very subject he had only just been\nthinking about, hurt and stung him.",
      "Levin scowled, and without\nanswering her, he sat down again to his work, repeating to himself all\nthat he had been thinking of the real significance of that work.",
      "Only\nat intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of Agafea\nMihalovna s needles, and recollecting what he did not want to remember,\nhe frowned again.",
      "At nine o clock they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a\ncarriage over the mud.",
      "Well, here s visitors come to us, and you won t be dull,  said Agafea\nMihalovna, getting up and going to the door.",
      "But Levin overtook her.",
      "His work was not going well now, and he was glad of a visitor, whoever\nit might be.",
      "Chapter 31\n\nRunning halfway down the staircase, Levin caught a sound he knew, a\nfamiliar cough in the hall.",
      "But he heard it indistinctly through the\nsound of his own footsteps, and hoped he was mistaken.",
      "Then he caught\nsight of a long, bony, familiar figure, and now it seemed there was no\npossibility of mistake; and yet he still went on hoping that this tall\nman taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother Nikolay.",
      "Levin loved his brother, but being with him was always a torture.",
      "Just\nnow, when Levin, under the influence of the thoughts that had come to\nhim, and Agafea Mihalovna s hint, was in a troubled and uncertain\nhumor, the meeting with his brother that he had to face seemed\nparticularly difficult.",
      "Instead of a lively, healthy visitor, some\noutsider who would, he hoped, cheer him up in his uncertain humor, he\nhad to see his brother, who knew him through and through, who would\ncall forth all the thoughts nearest his heart, would force him to show\nhimself fully.",
      "And that he was not disposed to do.",
      "Angry with himself for so base a feeling, Levin ran into the hall; as\nsoon as he had seen his brother close, this feeling of selfish\ndisappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity.",
      "Terrible as\nhis brother Nikolay had been before in his emaciation and sickliness,\nnow he looked still more emaciated, still more wasted.",
      "He was a\nskeleton covered with skin.",
      "He stood in the hall, jerking his long thin neck, and pulling the scarf\noff it, and smiled a strange and pitiful smile.",
      "When he saw that smile,\nsubmissive and humble, Levin felt something clutching at his throat.",
      "You see, I ve come to you,  said Nikolay in a thick voice, never for\none second taking his eyes off his brother s face.",
      "I ve been meaning\nto a long while, but I ve been unwell all the time.",
      "Now I m ever so\nmuch better,  he said, rubbing his beard with his big thin hands.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "answered Levin.",
      "And he felt still more frightened when,\nkissing him, he felt with his lips the dryness of his brother s skin\nand saw close to him his big eyes, full of a strange light.",
      "A few weeks before, Konstantin Levin had written to his brother that\nthrough the sale of the small part of the property, that had remained\nundivided, there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him\nas his share.",
      "Nikolay said that he had come now to take this money and, what was more\nimportant, to stay a while in the old nest, to get in touch with the\nearth, so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work\nthat lay before him.",
      "In spite of his exaggerated stoop, and the\nemaciation that was so striking from his height, his movements were as\nrapid and abrupt as ever.",
      "Levin led him into his study.",
      "His brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to\ndo combed his scanty, lank hair, and, smiling, went upstairs.",
      "He was in the most affectionate and good-humored mood, just as Levin\noften remembered him in childhood.",
      "He even referred to Sergey\nIvanovitch without rancor.",
      "When he saw Agafea Mihalovna, he made jokes\nwith her and asked after the old servants.",
      "The news of the death of\nParfen Denisitch made a painful impression on him.",
      "A look of fear\ncrossed his face, but he regained his serenity immediately.",
      "Of course he was quite old,  he said, and changed the subject.",
      "Well,\nI ll spend a month or two with you, and then I m off to Moscow.",
      "Do you\nknow, Myakov has promised me a place there, and I m going into the\nservice.",
      "Now I m going to arrange my life quite differently,  he went\non.",
      "You know I got rid of that woman.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna?",
      "Why, what for?",
      "Oh, she was a horrid woman!",
      "She caused me all sorts of worries.",
      "But\nhe did not say what the annoyances were.",
      "He could not say that he had\ncast off Marya Nikolaevna because the tea was weak, and, above all,\nbecause she would look after him, as though he were an invalid.",
      "Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now.",
      "I ve done\nsilly things, of course, like everyone else, but money s the last\nconsideration; I don t regret it.",
      "So long as there s health, and my\nhealth, thank God, is quite restored.",
      "Levin listened and racked his brains, but could think of nothing to\nsay.",
      "Nikolay probably felt the same; he began questioning his brother\nabout his affairs; and Levin was glad to talk about himself, because\nthen he could speak without hypocrisy.",
      "He told his brother of his plans\nand his doings.",
      "His brother listened, but evidently he was not interested by it.",
      "These two men were so akin, so near each other, that the slightest\ngesture, the tone of voice, told both more than could be said in words.",
      "Both of them now had only one thought the illness of Nikolay and the\nnearness of his death which stifled all else.",
      "But neither of them dared\nto speak of it, and so whatever they said not uttering the one thought\nthat filled their minds was all falsehood.",
      "Never had Levin been so glad\nwhen the evening was over and it was time to go to bed.",
      "Never with any\noutside person, never on any official visit had he been so unnatural\nand false as he was that evening.",
      "And the consciousness of this\nunnaturalness, and the remorse he felt at it, made him even more\nunnatural.",
      "He wanted to weep over his dying, dearly loved brother, and\nhe had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live.",
      "As the house was damp, and only one bedroom had been kept heated, Levin\nput his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a screen.",
      "His brother got into bed, and whether he slept or did not sleep, tossed\nabout like a sick man, coughed, and when he could not get his throat\nclear, mumbled something.",
      "Sometimes when his breathing was painful, he\nsaid,  Oh, my God!",
      "Sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily,\n Ah, the devil!",
      "Levin could not sleep for a long while, hearing him.",
      "His thoughts were of the most various, but the end of all his thoughts\nwas the same death.",
      "Death, the inevitable end of all, for the first\ntime presented itself to him with irresistible force.",
      "And death, which\nwas here in this loved brother, groaning half asleep and from habit\ncalling without distinction on God and the devil, was not so remote as\nit had hitherto seemed to him.",
      "It was in himself too, he felt that.",
      "If\nnot today, tomorrow, if not tomorrow, in thirty years, wasn t it all\nthe same!",
      "And what was this inevitable death he did not know, had never\nthought about it, and what was more, had not the power, had not the\ncourage to think about it.",
      "I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I\nhad forgotten death.",
      "He sat on his bed in the darkness, crouched up, hugging his knees, and\nholding his breath from the strain of thought, he pondered.",
      "But the\nmore intensely he thought, the clearer it became to him that it was\nindubitably so, that in reality, looking upon life, he had forgotten\none little fact that death will come, and all ends; that nothing was\neven worth beginning, and that there was no helping it anyway.",
      "Yes, it\nwas awful, but it was so.",
      "But I am alive still.",
      "Now what s to be done?",
      "what s to be done?",
      "he\nsaid in despair.",
      "He lighted a candle, got up cautiously and went to the\nlooking-glass, and began looking at his face and hair.",
      "Yes, there were\ngray hairs about his temples.",
      "He opened his mouth.",
      "His back teeth were\nbeginning to decay.",
      "He bared his muscular arms.",
      "Yes, there was strength\nin them.",
      "But Nikolay, who lay there breathing with what was left of\nlungs, had had a strong, healthy body too.",
      "And suddenly he recalled how\nthey used to go to bed together as children, and how they only waited\ntill Fyodor Bogdanitch was out of the room to fling pillows at each\nother and laugh, laugh irrepressibly, so that even their awe of Fyodor\nBogdanitch could not check the effervescing, overbrimming sense of life\nand happiness.",
      "And now that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing\nwhat will become of me, or wherefore.... \n\n K...ha!",
      "K...ha!",
      "Damnation!",
      "Why do you keep fidgeting, why don t you go\nto sleep?",
      "his brother s voice called to him.",
      "Oh, I don t know, I m not sleepy.",
      "I have had a good sleep, I m not in a sweat now.",
      "Just see, feel my\nshirt; it s not wet, is it?",
      "Levin felt, withdrew behind the screen, and put out the candle, but for\na long while he could not sleep.",
      "The question how to live had hardly\nbegun to grow a little clearer to him, when a new, insoluble question\npresented itself death.",
      "Why, he s dying yes, he ll die in the spring, and how help him?",
      "What\ncan I say to him?",
      "What do I know about it?",
      "I d even forgotten that it\nwas at all.",
      "Chapter 32\n\nLevin had long before made the observation that when one is\nuncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and\nmeek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their\ntouchiness and irritability.",
      "He felt that this was how it would be with\nhis brother.",
      "And his brother Nikolay s gentleness did in fact not last\nout for long.",
      "The very next morning he began to be irritable, and\nseemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking him on\nhis tenderest points.",
      "Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right.",
      "He felt\nthat if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is\ncalled, from the heart that is to say, had said only just what they\nwere thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each\nother s faces, and Konstantin could only have said,  You re dying,\nyou re dying!",
      "and Nikolay could only have answered,  I know I m dying,\nbut I m afraid, I m afraid, I m afraid!",
      "And they could have said\nnothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts.",
      "But life\nlike that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he had\nbeen trying to do all his life, and never could learn to do, though, as\nfar as he could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and\nwithout it there was no living at all.",
      "He tried to say what he was not\nthinking, but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that\nhis brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it.",
      "The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him\nagain, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding\nit with communism.",
      "You ve simply borrowed an idea that s not your own, but you ve\ndistorted it, and are trying to apply it where it s not applicable.",
      "But I tell you it s nothing to do with it.",
      "They deny the justice of\nproperty, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this chief\nstimulus.",
      "(Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions, but\never since he had been engrossed by his work, he had unconsciously come\nmore and more frequently to use words not Russian.)",
      "All I want is to\nregulate labor.",
      "Which means, you ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that gave it\nits force, and want to make believe that it s something new,  said\nNikolay, angrily tugging at his necktie.",
      "But my idea has nothing in common.... \n\n That, anyway,  said Nikolay Levin, with an ironical smile, his eyes\nflashing malignantly,  has the charm of what s one to call\nit?",
      "geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness.",
      "It may be a\nUtopia.",
      "But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the\npast a _tabula rasa_ no property, no family then labor would organize\nitself.",
      "But you gain nothing.... \n\n Why do you mix things up?",
      "I ve never been a communist.",
      "But I have, and I consider it s premature, but rational, and it has a\nfuture, just like Christianity in its first ages.",
      "All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated\nfrom the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it ought to\nbe studied, its qualities ascertained....",
      "But that s utter waste of time.",
      "That force finds a certain form of\nactivity of itself, according to the stage of its development.",
      "There\nhave been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the\nhalf-crop system, rent, and day laborers.",
      "What are you trying to find?",
      "Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the bottom of\nhis heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to\nhold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms, and\nthat this was hardly possible.",
      "I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for\nthe laborers.",
      "I want to organize....  he answered hotly.",
      "You don t want to organize anything; it s simply just as you ve been\nall your life, that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting\nthe peasants simply, but with some idea in view.",
      "Oh, all right, that s what you think and let me alone!",
      "answered\nLevin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably.",
      "You ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want is to\nplease your vanity.",
      "Oh, very well; then let me alone!",
      "And I will let you alone!",
      "and it s high time I did, and go to the\ndevil with you!",
      "and I m very sorry I ever came!",
      "In spite of all Levin s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards,\nNikolay would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was better\nto part, and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable\nto him.",
      "Nikolay was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in to him\nagain and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him if he had hurt\nhis feelings in any way.",
      "Ah, generosity!",
      "said Nikolay, and he smiled.",
      "If you want to be\nright, I can give you that satisfaction.",
      "You re in the right; but I m\ngoing all the same.",
      "It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him, and said, looking\nwith sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother:\n\n Anyway, don t remember evil against me, Kostya!",
      "and his voice\nquivered.",
      "These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely\nbetween them.",
      "Levin knew that those words meant,  You see, and you\nknow, that I m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other\nagain.",
      "Levin knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes.",
      "He kissed\nhis brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to\nsay.",
      "Three days after his brother s departure, Levin too set off for his\nforeign tour.",
      "Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky, Kitty s cousin, in the\nrailway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression.",
      "What s the matter with you?",
      "Shtcherbatsky asked him.",
      "Oh, nothing; there s not much happiness in life.",
      "Not much?",
      "You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen.",
      "You shall\nsee how to be happy.",
      "No, I ve done with it all.",
      "It s time I was dead.",
      "Well, that s a good one!",
      "said Shtcherbatsky, laughing;  why, I m only\njust getting ready to begin.",
      "Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon be\ndead.",
      "Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late.",
      "He saw nothing\nbut death or the advance towards death in everything.",
      "But his cherished\nscheme only engrossed him the more.",
      "Life had to be got through somehow\ntill death did come.",
      "Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but\njust because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the\ndarkness was his work, and he clutched it and clung to it with all his\nstrength.",
      "PART FOUR\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nThe Karenins, husband and wife, continued living in the same house, met\nevery day, but were complete strangers to one another.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch made it a rule to see his wife every day, so that the\nservants might have no grounds for suppositions, but avoided dining at\nhome.",
      "Vronsky was never at Alexey Alexandrovitch s house, but Anna saw\nhim away from home, and her husband was aware of it.",
      "The position was one of misery for all three; and not one of them would\nhave been equal to enduring this position for a single day, if it had\nnot been for the expectation that it would change, that it was merely a\ntemporary painful ordeal which would pass over.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nhoped that this passion would pass, as everything does pass, that\neveryone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.",
      "Anna, on whom the position depended, and for whom it was more miserable\nthan for anyone, endured it because she not merely hoped, but firmly\nbelieved, that it would all very soon be settled and come right.",
      "She\nhad not the least idea what would settle the position, but she firmly\nbelieved that something would very soon turn up now.",
      "Vronsky, against\nhis own will or wishes, followed her lead, hoped too that something,\napart from his own action, would be sure to solve all difficulties.",
      "In the middle of the winter Vronsky spent a very tiresome week.",
      "A\nforeign prince, who had come on a visit to Petersburg, was put under\nhis charge, and he had to show him the sights worth seeing.",
      "Vronsky was\nof distinguished appearance; he possessed, moreover, the art of\nbehaving with respectful dignity, and was used to having to do with\nsuch grand personages that was how he came to be put in charge of the\nprince.",
      "But he felt his duties very irksome.",
      "The prince was anxious to\nmiss nothing of which he would be asked at home, had he seen that in\nRussia?",
      "And on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost\nall Russian forms of amusement.",
      "Vronsky was obliged to be his guide in\nsatisfying both these inclinations.",
      "The mornings they spent driving to\nlook at places of interest; the evenings they passed enjoying the\nnational entertainments.",
      "The prince rejoiced in health exceptional even\namong princes.",
      "By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had\nbrought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure\nhe looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber.",
      "The prince had\ntraveled a great deal, and considered one of the chief advantages of\nmodern facilities of communication was the accessibility of the\npleasures of all nations.",
      "He had been in Spain, and there had indulged in serenades and had made\nfriends with a Spanish girl who played the mandolin.",
      "In Switzerland he\nhad killed chamois.",
      "In England he had galloped in a red coat over\nhedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet.",
      "In Turkey he had got\ninto a harem; in India he had hunted on an elephant, and now in Russia\nhe wished to taste all the specially Russian forms of pleasure.",
      "Vronsky, who was, as it were, chief master of the ceremonies to him,\nwas at great pains to arrange all the Russian amusements suggested by\nvarious persons to the prince.",
      "They had race horses, and Russian\npancakes and bear hunts and three-horse sledges, and gypsies and\ndrinking feasts, with the Russian accompaniment of broken crockery.",
      "And\nthe prince with surprising ease fell in with the Russian spirit,\nsmashed trays full of crockery, sat with a gypsy girl on his knee, and\nseemed to be asking what more, and does the whole Russian spirit\nconsist in just this?",
      "In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best\nFrench actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne.",
      "Vronsky\nwas used to princes, but, either because he had himself changed of\nlate, or that he was in too close proximity to the prince, that week\nseemed fearfully wearisome to him.",
      "The whole of that week he\nexperienced a sensation such as a man might have set in charge of a\ndangerous madman, afraid of the madman, and at the same time, from\nbeing with him, fearing for his own reason.",
      "Vronsky was continually\nconscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of\nstern official respectfulness, that he might not himself be insulted.",
      "The prince s manner of treating the very people who, to Vronsky s\nsurprise, were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with\nRussian amusements, was contemptuous.",
      "His criticisms of Russian women,\nwhom he wished to study, more than once made Vronsky crimson with\nindignation.",
      "The chief reason why the prince was so particularly\ndisagreeable to Vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in\nhim.",
      "And what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his self-esteem.",
      "He\nwas a very stupid and very self-satisfied and very healthy and very\nwell-washed man, and nothing else.",
      "He was a gentleman that was true,\nand Vronsky could not deny it.",
      "He was equable and not cringing with his\nsuperiors, was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals,\nand was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors.",
      "Vronsky was\nhimself the same, and regarded it as a great merit to be so.",
      "But for\nthis prince he was an inferior, and his contemptuous and indulgent\nattitude to him revolted him.",
      "Brainless beef!",
      "can I be like that?",
      "he thought.",
      "Be that as it might, when, on the seventh day, he parted from the\nprince, who was starting for Moscow, and received his thanks, he was\nhappy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant\nreflection of himself.",
      "He said good-bye to him at the station on their\nreturn from a bear hunt, at which they had had a display of Russian\nprowess kept up all night.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nWhen he got home, Vronsky found there a note from Anna.",
      "She wrote,  I\nam ill and unhappy.",
      "I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer\nwithout seeing you.",
      "Come in this evening.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to\nthe council at seven and will be there till ten.",
      "Thinking for an\ninstant of the strangeness of her bidding him come straight to her, in\nspite of her husband s insisting on her not receiving him, he decided\nto go.",
      "Vronsky had that winter got his promotion, was now a colonel, had left\nthe regimental quarters, and was living alone.",
      "After having some lunch,\nhe lay down on the sofa immediately, and in five minutes memories of\nthe hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were\nconfused together and joined on to a mental image of Anna and of the\npeasant who had played an important part in the bear hunt, and Vronsky\nfell asleep.",
      "He waked up in the dark, trembling with horror, and made\nhaste to light a candle.",
      "What was it?",
      "What?",
      "What was the dreadful\nthing I dreamed?",
      "Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled\nbeard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began\nsaying some strange words in French.",
      "Yes, there was nothing else in the\ndream,  he said to himself.",
      "But why was it so awful?",
      "He vividly\nrecalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible French words the\npeasant had uttered, and a chill of horror ran down his spine.",
      "What nonsense!",
      "thought Vronsky, and glanced at his watch.",
      "It was half-past eight already.",
      "He rang up his servant, dressed in\nhaste, and went out onto the steps, completely forgetting the dream and\nonly worried at being late.",
      "As he drove up to the Karenins  entrance he\nlooked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine.",
      "A high, narrow\ncarriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance.",
      "He\nrecognized Anna s carriage.",
      "She is coming to me,  thought Vronsky,\n and better she should.",
      "I don t like going into that house.",
      "But no\nmatter; I can t hide myself,  he thought, and with that manner peculiar\nto him from childhood, as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of,\nVronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door.",
      "The door opened,\nand the hall-porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage.",
      "Vronsky,\nthough he did not usually notice details, noticed at this moment the\namazed expression with which the porter glanced at him.",
      "In the very\ndoorway Vronsky almost ran up against Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "The gas\njet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black\nhat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat.",
      "Karenin s fixed, dull eyes were fastened upon Vronsky s face.",
      "Vronsky\nbowed, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, chewing his lips, lifted his hand to\nhis hat and went on.",
      "Vronsky saw him without looking round get into the\ncarriage, pick up the rug and the opera-glass at the window and\ndisappear.",
      "Vronsky went into the hall.",
      "His brows were scowling, and his\neyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them.",
      "What a position!",
      "he thought.",
      "If he would fight, would stand up for\nhis honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or\nbaseness....",
      "He puts me in the position of playing false, which I never\nmeant and never mean to do.",
      "Vronsky s ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with Anna\nin the Vrede garden.",
      "Unconsciously yielding to the weakness of Anna who\nhad surrendered herself up to him utterly, and simply looked to him to\ndecide her fate, ready to submit to anything he had long ceased to\nthink that their tie might end as he had thought then.",
      "His ambitious\nplans had retreated into the background again, and feeling that he had\ngot out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite, he\nhad given himself entirely to his passion, and that passion was binding\nhim more and more closely to her.",
      "He was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating\nfootsteps.",
      "He knew she had been expecting him, had listened for him,\nand was now going back to the drawing-room.",
      "No,  she cried, on seeing him, and at the first sound of her voice the\ntears came into her eyes.",
      "No; if things are to go on like this, the\nend will come much, much too soon.",
      "What is it, dear one?",
      "What?",
      "I ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ... No, I\nwon t ...",
      "I can t quarrel with you.",
      "Of course you couldn t come.",
      "No, I\nwon t.  She laid her two hands on his shoulders, and looked a long\nwhile at him with a profound, passionate, and at the same time\nsearching look.",
      "She was studying his face to make up for the time she\nhad not seen him.",
      "She was, every time she saw him, making the picture\nof him in her imagination (incomparably superior, impossible in\nreality) fit with him as he really was.",
      "Chapter 3\n\n You met him?",
      "she asked, when they had sat down at the table in the\nlamplight.",
      "You re punished, you see, for being late.",
      "Yes; but how was it?",
      "Wasn t he to be at the council?",
      "He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again.",
      "But\nthat s no matter.",
      "Don t talk about it.",
      "Where have you been?",
      "With the\nprince still?",
      "She knew every detail of his existence.",
      "He was going to say that he had\nbeen up all night and had dropped asleep, but looking at her thrilled\nand rapturous face, he was ashamed.",
      "And he said he had had to go to\nreport on the prince s departure.",
      "But it s over now?",
      "He is gone?",
      "Thank God it s over!",
      "You wouldn t believe how insufferable it s been\nfor me.",
      "Why so?",
      "Isn t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?",
      "she\nsaid, knitting her brows; and taking up the crochet work that was lying\non the table, she began drawing the hook out of it, without looking at\nVronsky.",
      "I gave that life up long ago,  said he, wondering at the change in her\nface, and trying to divine its meaning.",
      "And I confess,  he said, with\na smile, showing his thick, white teeth,  this week I ve been, as it\nwere, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn t like\nit.",
      "She held the work in her hands, but did not crochet, and looked at him\nwith strange, shining, and hostile eyes.",
      "This morning Liza came to see me they re not afraid to call on me, in\nspite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,  she put in and she told me\nabout your Athenian evening.",
      "How loathsome!",
      "I was just going to say.... \n\nShe interrupted him.",
      "It was that Th r se you used to know?",
      "I was just saying.... \n\n How disgusting you are, you men!",
      "How is it you can t understand that a\nwoman can never forget that,  she said, getting more and more angry,\nand so letting him see the cause of her irritation,  especially a woman\nwho cannot know your life?",
      "What do I know?",
      "What have I ever known?",
      "she\nsaid,  what you tell me.",
      "And how do I know whether you tell me the\ntruth?...",
      "Anna, you hurt me.",
      "Don t you trust me?",
      "Haven t I told you that I\nhaven t a thought I wouldn t lay bare to you?",
      "Yes, yes,  she said, evidently trying to suppress her jealous\nthoughts.",
      "But if only you knew how wretched I am!",
      "I believe you, I\nbelieve you.... What were you saying?",
      "But he could not at once recall what he had been going to say.",
      "These\nfits of jealousy, which of late had been more and more frequent with\nher, horrified him, and however much he tried to disguise the fact,\nmade him feel cold to her, although he knew the cause of her jealousy\nwas her love for him.",
      "How often he had told himself that her love was\nhappiness; and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has\noutweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further\nfrom happiness than when he had followed her from Moscow.",
      "Then he had\nthought himself unhappy, but happiness was before him; now he felt that\nthe best happiness was already left behind.",
      "She was utterly unlike what\nshe had been when he first saw her.",
      "Both morally and physically she had\nchanged for the worse.",
      "She had broadened out all over, and in her face\nat the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil\nexpression of hatred that distorted it.",
      "He looked at her as a man looks\nat a faded flower he has gathered, with difficulty recognizing in it\nthe beauty for which he picked and ruined it.",
      "And in spite of this he\nfelt that then, when his love was stronger, he could, if he had greatly\nwished it, have torn that love out of his heart; but now, when as at\nthat moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her, he knew that what\nbound him to her could not be broken.",
      "Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince?",
      "I have\ndriven away the fiend,  she added.",
      "The fiend was the name they had\ngiven her jealousy.",
      "What did you begin to tell me about the prince?",
      "Why did you find it so tiresome?",
      "Oh, it was intolerable!",
      "he said, trying to pick up the thread of his\ninterrupted thought.",
      "He does not improve on closer acquaintance.",
      "If\nyou want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed beast such as takes\nmedals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,  he said, with a tone of\nvexation that interested her.",
      "No; how so?",
      "she replied.",
      "He s seen a great deal, anyway; he s\ncultured?",
      "It s an utterly different culture their culture.",
      "He s cultivated, one\nsees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise everything\nbut animal pleasures.",
      "But don t you all care for these animal pleasures?",
      "she said, and\nagain he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him.",
      "How is it you re defending him?",
      "he said, smiling.",
      "I m not defending him, it s nothing to me; but I imagine, if you had\nnot cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have got out of them.",
      "But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Th r se in the attire of\nEve.... \n\n Again, the devil again,  Vronsky said, taking the hand she had laid on\nthe table and kissing it.",
      "Yes; but I can t help it.",
      "You don t know what I have suffered waiting\nfor you.",
      "I believe I m not jealous.",
      "I m not jealous: I believe you when\nyou re here; but when you re away somewhere leading your life, so\nincomprehensible to me.... \n\nShe turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet\nwork, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop\nafter loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while\nthe slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff.",
      "How was it, then?",
      "Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch?",
      "Her voice\nsounded in an unnatural and jarring tone.",
      "We ran up against each other in the doorway.",
      "And he bowed to you like this?",
      "She drew a long face, and half-closing her eyes, quickly transformed\nher expression, folded her hands, and Vronsky suddenly saw in her\nbeautiful face the very expression with which Alexey Alexandrovitch had\nbowed to him.",
      "He smiled, while she laughed gaily, with that sweet, deep\nlaugh, which was one of her greatest charms.",
      "I don t understand him in the least,  said Vronsky.",
      "If after your\navowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had\ncalled me out but this I can t understand.",
      "How can he put up with such\na position?",
      "He feels it, that s evident.",
      "He?",
      "she said sneeringly.",
      "He s perfectly satisfied.",
      "What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?",
      "Only not he.",
      "Don t I know him, the falsity in which he s utterly\nsteeped?...",
      "Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?",
      "He understands nothing, and feels nothing.",
      "Could a man of any feeling\nlive in the same house with his unfaithful wife?",
      "Could he talk to her,\ncall her  my dear ?",
      "And again she could not help mimicking him:  Anna, _ma ch re_; Anna,\ndear!",
      "He s not a man, not a human being he s a doll!",
      "No one knows him; but I\nknow him.",
      "Oh, if I d been in his place, I d long ago have killed, have\ntorn to pieces a wife like me.",
      "I wouldn t have said,  Anna, _ma\nch re_ !",
      "He s not a man, he s an official machine.",
      "He doesn t\nunderstand that I m your wife, that he s outside, that he s\nsuperfluous.... Don t let s talk of him!...",
      "You re unfair, very unfair, dearest,  said Vronsky, trying to soothe\nher.",
      "But never mind, don t let s talk of him.",
      "Tell me what you ve been\ndoing?",
      "What is the matter?",
      "What has been wrong with you, and what did\nthe doctor say?",
      "She looked at him with mocking amusement.",
      "Evidently she had hit on\nother absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the\nmoment to give expression to them.",
      "But he went on:\n\n I imagine that it s not illness, but your condition.",
      "When will it be?",
      "The ironical light died away in her eyes, but a different smile, a\nconsciousness of something, he did not know what, and of quiet\nmelancholy, came over her face.",
      "Soon, soon.",
      "You say that our position is miserable, that we must put\nan end to it.",
      "If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would give\nto be able to love you freely and boldly!",
      "I should not torture myself\nand torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but not as\nwe expect.",
      "And at the thought of how it would come, she seemed so pitiable to\nherself that tears came into her eyes, and she could not go on.",
      "She\nlaid her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the\nlamplight.",
      "It won t come as we suppose.",
      "I didn t mean to say this to you, but\nyou ve made me.",
      "Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall all, all be\nat peace, and suffer no more.",
      "I don t understand,  he said, understanding her.",
      "You asked when?",
      "Soon.",
      "And I shan t live through it.",
      "Don t interrupt\nme!",
      "and she made haste to speak.",
      "I know it; I know for certain.",
      "I\nshall die; and I m very glad I shall die, and release myself and you.",
      "Tears dropped from her eyes; he bent down over her hand and began\nkissing it, trying to hide his emotion, which, he knew, had no sort of\ngrounds, though he could not control it.",
      "Yes, it s better so,  she said, tightly gripping his hand.",
      "That s the\nonly way, the only way left us.",
      "He had recovered himself, and lifted his head.",
      "How absurd!",
      "What absurd nonsense you are talking!",
      "No, it s the truth.",
      "What, what s the truth?",
      "That I shall die.",
      "I have had a dream.",
      "A dream?",
      "repeated Vronsky, and instantly he recalled the peasant of\nhis dream.",
      "Yes, a dream,  she said.",
      "It s a long while since I dreamed it.",
      "I\ndreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there,\nto find out something; you know how it is in dreams,  she said, her\neyes wide with horror;  and in the bedroom, in the corner, stood\nsomething.",
      "Oh, what nonsense!",
      "How can you believe....",
      "But she would not let him interrupt her.",
      "What she was saying was too\nimportant to her.",
      "And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a\ndisheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking.",
      "I wanted to run away,\nbut he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his\nhands.... \n\nShe showed how he had moved his hands.",
      "There was terror in her face.",
      "And Vronsky, remembering his dream, felt the same terror filling his\nsoul.",
      "He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you know:\n_Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le p trir_.... And in my horror\nI tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream.",
      "And I\nbegan asking myself what it meant.",
      "And Korney said to me:  In\nchildbirth you ll die, ma am, you ll die....  And I woke up.",
      "What nonsense, what nonsense!",
      "said Vronsky; but he felt himself that\nthere was no conviction in his voice.",
      "But don t let s talk of it.",
      "Ring the bell, I ll have tea.",
      "And stay a\nlittle now; it s not long I shall....",
      "But all at once she stopped.",
      "The expression of her face instantaneously\nchanged.",
      "Horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of\nsoft, solemn, blissful attention.",
      "He could not comprehend the meaning\nof the change.",
      "She was listening to the stirring of the new life within\nher.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, after meeting Vronsky on his own steps, drove,\nas he had intended, to the Italian opera.",
      "He sat through two acts\nthere, and saw everyone he had wanted to see.",
      "On returning home, he\ncarefully scrutinized the hat stand, and noticing that there was not a\nmilitary overcoat there, he went, as usual, to his own room.",
      "But,\ncontrary to his usual habit, he did not go to bed, he walked up and\ndown his study till three o clock in the morning.",
      "The feeling of\nfurious anger with his wife, who would not observe the proprieties and\nkeep to the one stipulation he had laid on her, not to receive her\nlover in her own home, gave him no peace.",
      "She had not complied with his\nrequest, and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain\na divorce and take away his son.",
      "He knew all the difficulties connected\nwith this course, but he had said he would do it, and now he must carry\nout his threat.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna had hinted that this was the\nbest way out of his position, and of late the obtaining of divorces had\nbeen brought to such perfection that Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a\npossibility of overcoming the formal difficulties.",
      "Misfortunes never\ncome singly, and the affairs of the reorganization of the native\ntribes, and of the irrigation of the lands of the Zaraisky province,\nhad brought such official worries upon Alexey Alexandrovitch that he\nhad been of late in a continual condition of extreme irritability.",
      "He did not sleep the whole night, and his fury, growing in a sort of\nvast, arithmetical progression, reached its highest limits in the\nmorning.",
      "He dressed in haste, and as though carrying his cup full of\nwrath, and fearing to spill any over, fearing to lose with his wrath\nthe energy necessary for the interview with his wife, he went into her\nroom directly he heard she was up.",
      "Anna, who had thought she knew her husband so well, was amazed at his\nappearance when he went in to her.",
      "His brow was lowering, and his eyes\nstared darkly before him, avoiding her eyes; his mouth was tightly and\ncontemptuously shut.",
      "In his walk, in his gestures, in the sound of his\nvoice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never\nseen in him.",
      "He went into her room, and without greeting her, walked\nstraight up to her writing-table, and taking her keys, opened a drawer.",
      "What do you want?",
      "she cried.",
      "Your lover s letters,  he said.",
      "They re not here,  she said, shutting the drawer; but from that action\nhe saw he had guessed right, and roughly pushing away her hand, he\nquickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most\nimportant papers.",
      "She tried to pull the portfolio away, but he pushed\nher back.",
      "Sit down!",
      "I have to speak to you,  he said, putting the portfolio\nunder his arm, and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his\nshoulder stood up.",
      "Amazed and intimidated, she gazed at him in silence.",
      "I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this\nhouse.",
      "I had to see him to.... \n\nShe stopped, not finding a reason.",
      "I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her\nlover.",
      "I meant, I only....  she said, flushing hotly.",
      "This coarseness of his\nangered her, and gave her courage.",
      "Surely you must feel how easy it is\nfor you to insult me?",
      "she said.",
      "An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief\nhe s a thief is simply _la constatation d un fait_.",
      "This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.",
      "You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, giving her\nthe honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition of\nobserving the proprieties: is that cruelty?",
      "It s worse than cruel it s base, if you want to know!",
      "Anna cried, in\na rush of hatred, and getting up, she was going away.",
      "No!",
      "he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher\nthan usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so\nviolently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing,\nhe forcibly sat her down in her place.",
      "Base!",
      "If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband\nand child for a lover, while you eat your husband s bread!",
      "She bowed her head.",
      "She did not say what she had said the evening\nbefore to her lover, that _he_ was her husband, and her husband was\nsuperfluous; she did not even think that.",
      "She felt all the justice of\nhis words, and only said softly:\n\n You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself;\nbut what are you saying all this for?",
      "What am I saying it for?",
      "what for?",
      "he went on, as angrily.",
      "That you\nmay know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to\nobserving outward decorum, I will take measures to put an end to this\nstate of things.",
      "Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,  she said; and again, at the\nthought of death near at hand and now desired, tears came into her\neyes.",
      "It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned!",
      "If you must\nhave the satisfaction of animal passion.... \n\n Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "I won t say it s not generous, but it s not\nlike a gentleman to strike anyone who s down.",
      "Yes, you only think of yourself!",
      "But the sufferings of a man who was\nyour husband have no interest for you.",
      "You don t care that his whole\nlife is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff.... \n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was speaking so quickly that he stammered, and\nwas utterly unable to articulate the word  suffering.",
      "In the end he\npronounced it  thuffering.",
      "She wanted to laugh, and was immediately\nashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment.",
      "And for the\nfirst time, for an instant, she felt for him, put herself in his place,\nand was sorry for him.",
      "But what could she say or do?",
      "Her head sank, and\nshe sat silent.",
      "He too was silent for some time, and then began\nspeaking in a frigid, less shrill voice, emphasizing random words that\nhad no special significance.",
      "I came to tell you....  he said.",
      "She glanced at him.",
      "No, it was my fancy,  she thought, recalling the\nexpression of his face when he stumbled over the word  suffering.",
      "No;\ncan a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency,\nfeel anything?",
      "I cannot change anything,  she whispered.",
      "I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall\nnot return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I\ndecide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of\ngetting a divorce.",
      "My son is going to my sister s,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about\nhis son.",
      "You take Seryozha to hurt me,  she said, looking at him from under her\nbrows.",
      "You do not love him.... Leave me Seryozha!",
      "Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is\nassociated with the repulsion I feel for you.",
      "But still I shall take\nhim.",
      "Good-bye!",
      "And he was going away, but now she detained him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!",
      "she whispered once more.",
      "I\nhave nothing else to say.",
      "Leave Seryozha till my ...",
      "I shall soon be\nconfined; leave him!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch flew into a rage, and, snatching his hand from\nher, he went out of the room without a word.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nThe waiting-room of the celebrated Petersburg lawyer was full when\nAlexey Alexandrovitch entered it.",
      "Three ladies an old lady, a young\nlady, and a merchant s wife and three gentlemen one a German banker\nwith a ring on his finger, the second a merchant with a beard, and the\nthird a wrathful-looking government clerk in official uniform, with a\ncross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already.",
      "Two\nclerks were writing at tables with scratching pens.",
      "The appurtenances\nof the writing-tables, about which Alexey Alexandrovitch was himself\nvery fastidious, were exceptionally good.",
      "He could not help observing\nthis.",
      "One of the clerks, without getting up, turned wrathfully to\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, half closing his eyes.",
      "What are you wanting?",
      "He replied that he had to see the lawyer on some business.",
      "He is engaged,  the clerk responded severely, and he pointed with his\npen at the persons waiting, and went on writing.",
      "Can t he spare time to see me?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He has no time free; he is always busy.",
      "Kindly wait your turn.",
      "Then I must trouble you to give him my card,  Alexey Alexandrovitch\nsaid with dignity, seeing the impossibility of preserving his\nincognito.",
      "The clerk took the card and, obviously not approving of what he read on\nit, went to the door.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was in principle in favor of the publicity of\nlegal proceedings, though for some higher official considerations he\ndisliked the application of the principle in Russia, and disapproved of\nit, as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority\nof the Emperor.",
      "His whole life had been spent in administrative work,\nand consequently, when he did not approve of anything, his disapproval\nwas softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and\nthe possibility of reform in every department.",
      "In the new public law\ncourts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting\ncases.",
      "But till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts, and\nso had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory; now his\ndisapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on\nhim in the lawyer s waiting room.",
      "Coming immediately,  said the clerk; and two minutes later there did\nactually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old solicitor who\nhad been consulting with the lawyer himself.",
      "The lawyer was a little, squat, bald man, with a dark, reddish beard,\nlight-colored long eyebrows, and an overhanging brow.",
      "He was attired as\nthough for a wedding, from his cravat to his double watch-chain and\nvarnished boots.",
      "His face was clever and manly, but his dress was\ndandified and in bad taste.",
      "Pray walk in,  said the lawyer, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch; and,\ngloomily ushering Karenin in before him, he closed the door.",
      "Won t you sit down?",
      "He indicated an armchair at a writing-table\ncovered with papers.",
      "He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little hands\nwith short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his head on one\nside.",
      "But as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over\nthe table.",
      "The lawyer, with a swiftness that could never have been\nexpected of him, opened his hands, caught the moth, and resumed his\nformer attitude.",
      "Before beginning to speak of my business,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nfollowing the lawyer s movements with wondering eyes,  I ought to\nobserve that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be\nstrictly private.",
      "The lawyer s overhanging reddish mustaches were parted in a scarcely\nperceptible smile.",
      "I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to\nme.",
      "But if you would like proof.... \n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd,\ngray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already.",
      "You know my name?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch resumed.",
      "I know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing,\nlike every Russian,  said the lawyer, bowing.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed, plucking up his courage.",
      "But having once\nmade up his mind he went on in his shrill voice, without timidity or\nhesitation, accentuating here and there a word.",
      "I have the misfortune,  Alexey Alexandrovitch began,  to have been\ndeceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations\nwith my wife by legal means that is, to be divorced, but to do this so\nthat my son may not remain with his mother.",
      "The lawyer s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with\nirrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not\nsimply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job: there\nwas triumph and joy, there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he saw\nin his wife s eyes.",
      "You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?",
      "Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your\ntime and attention.",
      "I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary\nstep.",
      "I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of\ngreat consequence to me.",
      "It is very possible that if that form does not\ncorrespond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.",
      "Oh, that s always the case,  said the lawyer,  and that s always for\nyou to decide.",
      "He let his eyes rest on Alexey Alexandrovitch s feet, feeling that he\nmight offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement.",
      "He\nlooked at a moth that flew before his nose, and moved his hands, but\ndid not catch it from regard for Alexey Alexandrovitch s position.",
      "Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to\nme,  pursued Alexey Alexandrovitch,  I should be glad to have an idea\nof the forms in which such things are done in practice.",
      "You would be glad,  the lawyer, without lifting his eyes, responded,\nadopting, with a certain satisfaction, the tone of his client s\nremarks,  for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could\nsecure what you desire?",
      "And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went\non, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch s face,\nwhich was growing red in patches.",
      "Divorce by our laws,  he said, with a slight shade of disapprobation\nof our laws,  is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....",
      "Wait a little!",
      "he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door,\nbut he got up all the same, said a few words to him, and sat down\nagain.",
      "...",
      "In the following cases: physical defect in the married\nparties, desertion without communication for five years,  he said,\ncrooking a short finger covered with hair,  adultery  (this word he\npronounced with obvious satisfaction),  subdivided as follows  (he\ncontinued to crook his fat fingers, though the three cases and their\nsubdivisions could obviously not be classified together):  physical\ndefect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the\nwife.",
      "As by now all his fingers were used up, he uncrooked all his\nfingers and went on:  This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you\nhave done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application\nin practice.",
      "And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you\nthat in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the\nfollowing there s no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed his head in assent.",
      "May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married\nparties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual\nagreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection.",
      "It must be\nadmitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,  said the\nlawyer, and stealing a glance at Alexey Alexandrovitch he paused, as a\nman selling pistols, after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon,\nmight await his customer s choice.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch said\nnothing, and therefore the lawyer went on:  The most usual and simple,\nthe sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent.",
      "I\nshould not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no\neducation,  he said,  but I imagine that to you this is\ncomprehensible.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was, however, so perturbed that he did not\nimmediately comprehend all the good sense of adultery by mutual\nconsent, and his eyes expressed this uncertainty; but the lawyer\npromptly came to his assistance.",
      "People cannot go on living together here you have a fact.",
      "And if both\nare agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no\nimportance.",
      "And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain\nmethod.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch fully understood now.",
      "But he had religious\nscruples, which hindered the execution of such a plan.",
      "That is out of the question in the present case,  he said.",
      "Only one\nalternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters\nwhich I have.",
      "At the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips, and gave\nutterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound.",
      "Kindly consider,  he began,  cases of that kind are, as you are aware,\nunder ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of\ngoing into the minutest details in cases of that kind,  he said with a\nsmile, which betrayed his sympathy with the reverend fathers  taste.",
      "Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in\nthe fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by\neyewitnesses.",
      "In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your\nconfidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the\nmeasures to be employed.",
      "If one wants the result, one must admit the\nmeans.",
      "If it is so....  Alexey Alexandrovitch began, suddenly turning white;\nbut at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak\nto the intruding clerk.",
      "Tell her we don t haggle over fees!",
      "he said, and returned to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "On his way back he caught unobserved another moth.",
      "Nice state my rep\ncurtains will be in by the summer!",
      "he thought, frowning.",
      "And so you were saying?...",
      "he said.",
      "I will communicate my decision to you by letter,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, getting up, and he clutched at the table.",
      "After\nstanding a moment in silence, he said:  From your words I may\nconsequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained?",
      "I would ask you\nto let me know what are your terms.",
      "It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,  said\nthe lawyer, not answering his question.",
      "When can I reckon on receiving\ninformation from you?",
      "he asked, moving towards the door, his eyes and\nhis varnished boots shining.",
      "In a week s time.",
      "Your answer as to whether you will undertake to\nconduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to\ncommunicate to me.",
      "Very good.",
      "The lawyer bowed respectfully, let his client out of the door, and,\nleft alone, gave himself up to his sense of amusement.",
      "He felt so\nmirthful that, contrary to his rules, he made a reduction in his terms\nto the haggling lady, and gave up catching moths, finally deciding that\nnext winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet, like\nSigonin s.\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of\nthe Commission of the 17th of August, but in the sequel this victory\ncut the ground from under his feet.",
      "The new commission for the inquiry\ninto the condition of the native tribes in all its branches had been\nformed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and\nenergy inspired by Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Within three months a report\nwas presented.",
      "The condition of the native tribes was investigated in\nits political, administrative, economic, ethnographic, material, and\nreligious aspects.",
      "To all these questions there were answers admirably\nstated, and answers admitting no shade of doubt, since they were not a\nproduct of human thought, always liable to error, but were all the\nproduct of official activity.",
      "The answers were all based on official\ndata furnished by governors and heads of churches, and founded on the\nreports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents,\nfounded in their turn on the reports of parochial overseers and parish\npriests; and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain.",
      "All\nsuch questions as, for instance, of the cause of failure of crops, of\nthe adherence of certain tribes to their ancient beliefs,\netc.",
      "questions which, but for the convenient intervention of the\nofficial machine, are not, and cannot be solved for ages received full,\nunhesitating solution.",
      "And this solution was in favor of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s contention.",
      "But Stremov, who had felt stung to the\nquick at the last sitting, had, on the reception of the commission s\nreport, resorted to tactics which Alexey Alexandrovitch had not\nanticipated.",
      "Stremov, carrying with him several members, went over to\nAlexey Alexandrovitch s side, and not contenting himself with warmly\ndefending the measure proposed by Karenin, proposed other more extreme\nmeasures in the same direction.",
      "These measures, still further\nexaggerated in opposition to what was Alexey Alexandrovitch s\nfundamental idea, were passed by the commission, and then the aim of\nStremov s tactics became apparent.",
      "Carried to an extreme, the measures\nseemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities, and public\nopinion, and intellectual ladies, and the newspapers, all at the same\ntime fell foul of them, expressing their indignation both with the\nmeasures and their nominal father, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Stremov drew\nback, affecting to have blindly followed Karenin, and to be astounded\nand distressed at what had been done.",
      "This meant the defeat of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "But in spite of failing health, in spite of his\ndomestic griefs, he did not give in.",
      "There was a split in the\ncommission.",
      "Some members, with Stremov at their head, justified their\nmistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of\nrevision, instituted by Alexey Alexandrovitch, and maintained that the\nreport of the commission was rubbish, and simply so much waste paper.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, with a following of those who saw the danger of\nso revolutionary an attitude to official documents, persisted in\nupholding the statements obtained by the revising commission.",
      "In\nconsequence of this, in the higher spheres, and even in society, all\nwas chaos, and although everyone was interested, no one could tell\nwhether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined,\nor whether they were in a flourishing condition.",
      "The position of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, owing to this, and partly owing to the contempt\nlavished on him for his wife s infidelity, became very precarious.",
      "And\nin this position he took an important resolution.",
      "To the astonishment\nof the commission, he announced that he should ask permission to go\nhimself to investigate the question on the spot.",
      "And having obtained\npermission, Alexey Alexandrovitch prepared to set off to these remote\nprovinces.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s departure made a great sensation, the more so\nas just before he started he officially returned the posting-fares\nallowed him for twelve horses, to drive to his destination.",
      "I think it very noble,  Betsy said about this to the Princess Myakaya.",
      "Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are\nrailways everywhere now?",
      "But Princess Myakaya did not agree, and the Princess Tverskaya s\nopinion annoyed her indeed.",
      "It s all very well for you to talk,  said she,  when you have I don t\nknow how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a\nrevising tour in the summer.",
      "It s very good for him and pleasant\ntraveling about, and it s a settled arrangement for me to keep a\ncarriage and coachman on the money.",
      "On his way to the remote provinces Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped for\nthree days at Moscow.",
      "The day after his arrival he was driving back from calling on the\ngovernor-general.",
      "At the crossroads by Gazetoy Place, where there are\nalways crowds of carriages and sledges, Alexey Alexandrovitch suddenly\nheard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he\ncould not help looking round.",
      "At the corner of the pavement, in a\nshort, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily\naskew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips,\nstood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming.",
      "He called him\nvigorously and urgently, and insisted on his stopping.",
      "He had one arm\non the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner, and out of\nthe window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat, and two\nchildren.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was smiling and beckoning to his\nbrother-in-law.",
      "The lady smiled a kindly smile too, and she too waved\nher hand to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "It was Dolly with her children.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not want to see anyone in Moscow, and least\nof all his wife s brother.",
      "He raised his hat and would have driven on,\nbut Stepan Arkadyevitch told his coachman to stop, and ran across the\nsnow to him.",
      "Well, what a shame not to have let us know!",
      "Been here long?",
      "I was at\nDussots  yesterday and saw  Karenin  on the visitors  list, but it\nnever entered my head that it was you,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nsticking his head in at the window of the carriage,  or I should have\nlooked you up.",
      "I am glad to see you!",
      "he said, knocking one foot\nagainst the other to shake the snow off.",
      "What a shame of you not to\nlet us know!",
      "he repeated.",
      "I had no time; I am very busy,  Alexey Alexandrovitch responded dryly.",
      "Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were\nwrapped, and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to\nDarya Alexandrovna.",
      "Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?",
      "said Dolly, smiling.",
      "I was very busy.",
      "Delighted to see you!",
      "he said in a tone clearly\nindicating that he was annoyed by it.",
      "How are you?",
      "Tell me, how is my darling Anna?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled something and would have gone on.",
      "But\nStepan Arkadyevitch stopped him.",
      "I tell you what we ll do tomorrow.",
      "Dolly, ask him to dinner.",
      "We ll ask\nKoznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him with our Moscow\ncelebrities.",
      "Yes, please, do come,  said Dolly;  we will expect you at five, or six\no clock, if you like.",
      "How is my darling Anna?",
      "How long.... \n\n She is quite well,  Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled, frowning.",
      "Delighted!",
      "and he moved away towards his carriage.",
      "You will come?",
      "Dolly called after him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the\nnoise of the moving carriages.",
      "I shall come round tomorrow!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it\nso as neither to see nor be seen.",
      "Queer fish!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his\nwatch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a\ncaress to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the\npavement.",
      "Stiva!",
      "Stiva!",
      "Dolly called, reddening.",
      "He turned round.",
      "I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya.",
      "Give me the money.",
      "Never mind; you tell them I ll pay the bill!",
      "and he vanished, nodding\ngenially to an acquaintance who drove by.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nThe next day was Sunday.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater\nto a rehearsal of the ballet, and gave Masha Tchibisova, a pretty\ndancing-girl whom he had just taken under his protection, the coral\nnecklace he had promised her the evening before, and behind the scenes\nin the dim daylight of the theater, managed to kiss her pretty little\nface, radiant over her present.",
      "Besides the gift of the necklace he\nwanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet.",
      "After\nexplaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet, he\npromised he would come for the last act and take her to supper.",
      "From\nthe theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row, selected himself\nthe fish and asparagus for dinner, and by twelve o clock was at\nDussots , where he had to see three people, luckily all staying at the\nsame hotel: Levin, who had recently come back from abroad and was\nstaying there; the new head of his department, who had just been\npromoted to that position, and had come on a tour of revision to\nMoscow; and his brother-in-law, Karenin, whom he must see, so as to be\nsure of bringing him to dinner.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining, but still better he liked to give a\ndinner, small, but very choice, both as regards the food and drink and\nas regards the selection of guests.",
      "He particularly liked the program\nof that day s dinner.",
      "There would be fresh perch, asparagus, and _la\npi ce de resistance_ first-rate, but quite plain, roast beef, and wines\nto suit: so much for the eating and drinking.",
      "Kitty and Levin would be\nof the party, and that this might not be obtrusively evident, there\nwould be a girl cousin too, and young Shtcherbatsky, and _la pi ce de\nresistance_ among the guests Sergey Koznishev and Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man, and a philosopher;\nAlexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger, and a practical politician.",
      "He\nwas asking, too, the well-known eccentric enthusiast, Pestsov, a\nliberal, a great talker, a musician, an historian, and the most\ndelightfully youthful person of fifty, who would be a sauce or garnish\nfor Koznishev and Karenin.",
      "He would provoke them and set them off.",
      "The second installment for the forest had been received from the\nmerchant and was not yet exhausted; Dolly had been very amiable and\ngood-humored of late, and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan\nArkadyevitch from every point of view.",
      "He was in the most light-hearted\nmood.",
      "There were two circumstances a little unpleasant, but these two\ncircumstances were drowned in the sea of good-humored gaiety which\nflooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "These two circumstances were:\nfirst, that on meeting Alexey Alexandrovitch the day before in the\nstreet he had noticed that he was cold and reserved with him, and\nputting the expression of Alexey Alexandrovitch s face and the fact\nthat he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with\nthe rumors he had heard about Anna and Vronsky, Stepan Arkadyevitch\nguessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife.",
      "That was one disagreeable thing.",
      "The other slightly disagreeable fact\nwas that the new head of his department, like all new heads, had the\nreputation already of a terrible person, who got up at six o clock in\nthe morning, worked like a horse, and insisted on his subordinates\nworking in the same way.",
      "Moreover, this new head had the further\nreputation of being a bear in his manners, and was, according to all\nreports, a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which\nhis predecessor had belonged, and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had\nhitherto belonged himself.",
      "On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had\nappeared at the office in a uniform, and the new chief had been very\naffable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance.",
      "Consequently\nStepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his\nnon-official dress.",
      "The thought that the new chief might not tender him\na warm reception was the other unpleasant thing.",
      "But Stepan\nArkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would _come round_ all\nright.",
      "They re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty\nand quarrelsome?",
      "he thought as he went into the hotel.",
      "Good-day, Vassily,  he said, walking into the corridor with his hat\ncocked on one side, and addressing a footman he knew;  why, you ve let\nyour whiskers grow!",
      "Levin, number seven, eh?",
      "Take me up, please.",
      "And\nfind out whether Count Anitchkin  (this was the new head)  is\nreceiving.",
      "Yes, sir,  Vassily responded, smiling.",
      "You ve not been to see us for\na long while.",
      "I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance.",
      "Is this number\nseven?",
      "Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room,\nmeasuring a fresh bearskin, when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in.",
      "What!",
      "you killed him?",
      "cried Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well done!",
      "A\nshe-bear?",
      "How are you, Arhip!",
      "He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair,\nwithout taking off his coat and hat.",
      "Come, take off your coat and stay a little,  said Levin, taking his\nhat.",
      "No, I haven t time; I ve only looked in for a tiny second,  answered\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He threw open his coat, but afterwards did take it\noff, and sat on for a whole hour, talking to Levin about hunting and\nthe most intimate subjects.",
      "Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad?",
      "Where have you been?",
      "said\nStepan Arkadyevitch, when the peasant had gone.",
      "Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England not in\nthe capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that\nwas new to me.",
      "And I m glad I went.",
      "Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.",
      "Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question.",
      "In Russia the\nquestion is that of the relation of the working people to the land;\nthough the question exists there too but there it s a matter of\nrepairing what s been ruined, while with us.... \n\nStepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "he said,  it s very possible you re right.",
      "But I m glad\nyou re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and\ninterested.",
      "Shtcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you\nwere in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death.... \n\n Well, what of it?",
      "I ve not given up thinking of death,  said Levin.",
      "It s true that it s high time I was dead; and that all this is\nnonsense.",
      "It s the truth I m telling you.",
      "I do value my idea and my\nwork awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours\nis nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.",
      "And for us to suppose we can have something great ideas, work it s all\ndust and ashes.",
      "But all that s as old as the hills, my boy!",
      "It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow\neverything becomes of no consequence.",
      "When you understand that you will\ndie tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything\nis so unimportant!",
      "And I consider my idea very important, but it turns\nout really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as\ndoing for that bear.",
      "So one goes on living, amusing oneself with\nhunting, with work anything so as not to think of death!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened\nto Levin.",
      "Well, of course!",
      "Here you ve come round to my point.",
      "Do you remember\nyou attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life?",
      "Don t be so severe, O\nmoralist!",
      "No; all the same, what s fine in life is....  Levin hesitated oh, I\ndon t know.",
      "All I know is that we shall soon be dead.",
      "Why so soon?",
      "And do you know, there s less charm in life, when one thinks of death,\nbut there s more peace.",
      "On the contrary, the finish is always the best.",
      "But I must be going, \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up for the tenth time.",
      "Oh, no, stay a bit!",
      "said Levin, keeping him.",
      "Now, when shall we see\neach other again?",
      "I m going tomorrow.",
      "I m a nice person!",
      "Why, that s just what I came for!",
      "You simply must\ncome to dinner with us today.",
      "Your brother s coming, and Karenin, my\nbrother-in-law.",
      "You don t mean to say he s here?",
      "said Levin, and he wanted to inquire\nabout Kitty.",
      "He had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was\nat Petersburg with her sister, the wife of the diplomat, and he did not\nknow whether she had come back or not; but he changed his mind and did\nnot ask.",
      "Whether she s coming or not, I don t care,  he said to\nhimself.",
      "So you ll come?",
      "Of course.",
      "At five o clock, then, and not evening dress.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of\nhis department.",
      "Instinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "The\nterrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person, and\nStepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on, so that it was four\no clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, on coming back from church service, had spent\nthe whole morning indoors.",
      "He had two pieces of business before him\nthat morning; first, to receive and send on a deputation from the\nnative tribes which was on its way to Petersburg, and now at Moscow;\nsecondly, to write the promised letter to the lawyer.",
      "The deputation,\nthough it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch s instigation, was\nnot without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect, and he was\nglad he had found it in Moscow.",
      "The members of this deputation had not\nthe slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play.",
      "They na vely believed that it was their business to lay before the\ncommission their needs and the actual condition of things, and to ask\nassistance of the government, and utterly failed to grasp that some of\ntheir statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy s\nside, and so spoiled the whole business.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was\nbusily engaged with them for a long while, drew up a program for them\nfrom which they were not to depart, and on dismissing them wrote a\nletter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation.",
      "He had his\nchief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "She was a\nspecialist in the matter of deputations, and no one knew better than\nshe how to manage them, and put them in the way they should go.",
      "Having\ncompleted this task, Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the\nlawyer.",
      "Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act\nas he might judge best.",
      "In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky s\nnotes to Anna, which were in the portfolio he had taken away.",
      "Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not\nreturning to his family again, and since he had been at the lawyer s\nand had spoken, though only to one man, of his intention, since\nespecially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to\nthe world of ink and paper, he had grown more and more used to his own\nintention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its\nexecution.",
      "He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer, when he heard the loud tones\nof Stepan Arkadyevitch s voice.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with\nAlexey Alexandrovitch s servant, and insisting on being announced.",
      "No matter,  thought Alexey Alexandrovitch,  so much the better.",
      "I will\ninform him at once of my position in regard to his sister, and explain\nwhy it is I can t dine with him.",
      "Come in!",
      "he said aloud, collecting his papers, and putting them in\nthe blotting-paper.",
      "There, you see, you re talking nonsense, and he s at home!",
      "responded\nStepan Arkadyevitch s voice, addressing the servant, who had refused to\nlet him in, and taking off his coat as he went, Oblonsky walked into\nthe room.",
      "Well, I m awfully glad I ve found you!",
      "So I hope....  Stepan\nArkadyevitch began cheerfully.",
      "I cannot come,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly, standing and not\nasking his visitor to sit down.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid\nrelations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against\nwhom he was beginning a suit for divorce.",
      "But he had not taken into\naccount the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear, shining eyes.",
      "Why can t you?",
      "What do you mean?",
      "he asked in perplexity, speaking in\nFrench.",
      "Oh, but it s a promise.",
      "And we re all counting on you.",
      "I want to tell you that I can t dine at your house, because the terms\nof relationship which have existed between us must cease.",
      "How?",
      "How do you mean?",
      "What for?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\nsmile.",
      "Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my\nwife.",
      "I ought to have....",
      "But, before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence,\nStepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected.",
      "He\ngroaned and sank into an armchair.",
      "No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "What are you saying?",
      "cried Oblonsky, and\nhis suffering was apparent in his face.",
      "It is so.",
      "Excuse me, I can t, I can t believe it!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, feeling that his words had not had the\neffect he anticipated, and that it would be unavoidable for him to\nexplain his position, and that, whatever explanations he might make,\nhis relations with his brother-in-law would remain unchanged.",
      "Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce,  he\nsaid.",
      "I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I know you for an\nexcellent, upright man; I know Anna excuse me, I can t change my\nopinion of her for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I\ncannot believe it.",
      "There is some misunderstanding,  said he.",
      "Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...",
      "Pardon, I understand,  interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But of\ncourse.... One thing: you must not act in haste.",
      "You must not, you must\nnot act in haste!",
      "I am not acting in haste,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly,  but one\ncannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter.",
      "I have quite made up my\nmind.",
      "This is awful!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I would do one thing,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I beseech you, do it!",
      "he said.",
      "No action has\nyet been taken, if I understand rightly.",
      "Before you take advice, see my\nwife, talk to her.",
      "She loves Anna like a sister, she loves you, and\nshe s a wonderful woman.",
      "For God s sake, talk to her!",
      "Do me that favor,\nI beseech you!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him\nsympathetically, without interrupting his silence.",
      "You will go to see her?",
      "I don t know.",
      "That was just why I have not been to see you.",
      "I imagine\nour relations must change.",
      "Why so?",
      "I don t see that.",
      "Allow me to believe that apart from our\nconnection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling\nI have always had for you ... and sincere esteem,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, pressing his hand.",
      "Even if your worst suppositions were\ncorrect, I don t and never would take on myself to judge either side,\nand I see no reason why our relations should be affected.",
      "But now, do\nthis, come and see my wife.",
      "Well, we look at the matter differently,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch\ncoldly.",
      "However, we won t discuss it.",
      "No; why shouldn t you come today to dine, anyway?",
      "My wife s expecting\nyou.",
      "Please, do come.",
      "And, above all, talk it over with her.",
      "She s a\nwonderful woman.",
      "For God s sake, on my knees, I implore you!",
      "If you so much wish it, I will come,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nsighing.",
      "And, anxious to change the conversation, he inquired about what\ninterested them both the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch s department,\na man not yet old, who had suddenly been promoted to so high a\nposition.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count\nAnitchkin, and had always differed from him in his opinions.",
      "But now,\nfrom a feeling readily comprehensible to officials that hatred felt by\none who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a\npromotion, he could not endure him.",
      "Well, have you seen him?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant\nsmile.",
      "Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday.",
      "He seems to know his work\ncapitally, and to be very energetic.",
      "Yes, but what is his energy directed to?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what s been done?",
      "It s the great misfortune of our government this paper administration,\nof which he s a worthy representative.",
      "Really, I don t know what fault one could find with him.",
      "His policy I\ndon t know, but one thing he s a very nice fellow,  answered Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "I ve just been seeing him, and he s really a capital\nfellow.",
      "We lunched together, and I taught him how to make, you know\nthat drink, wine and oranges.",
      "It s so cooling.",
      "And it s a wonder he\ndidn t know it.",
      "He liked it awfully.",
      "No, really he s a capital fellow.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch.",
      "Why, good heavens, it s four already, and I ve still to go to\nDolgovushin s!",
      "So please come round to dinner.",
      "You can t imagine how\nyou will grieve my wife and me.",
      "The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother-in-law out was\nvery different from the manner in which he had met him.",
      "I ve promised, and I ll come,  he answered wearily.",
      "Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won t regret it,  answered\nStepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "And, putting on his coat as he went, he patted the footman on the head,\nchuckled, and went out.",
      "At five o clock, and not evening dress, please,  he shouted once more,\nturning at the door.",
      "Chapter 9\n\nIt was past five, and several guests had already arrived, before the\nhost himself got home.",
      "He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch\nKoznishev and Pestsov, who had reached the street door at the same\nmoment.",
      "These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow\nintellectuals, as Oblonsky had called them.",
      "Both were men respected for\ntheir character and their intelligence.",
      "They respected each other, but\nwere in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject,\nnot because they belonged to opposite parties, but precisely because\nthey were of the same party (their enemies refused to see any\ndistinction between their views); but, in that party, each had his own\nspecial shade of opinion.",
      "And since no difference is less easily\novercome than the difference of opinion about semi-abstract questions,\nthey never agreed in any opinion, and had long, indeed, been accustomed\nto jeer without anger, each at the other s incorrigible aberrations.",
      "They were just going in at the door, talking of the weather, when\nStepan Arkadyevitch overtook them.",
      "In the drawing-room there were\nalready sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky, young\nShtcherbatsky, Turovtsin, Kitty, and Karenin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in\nthe drawing-room without him.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk\ngown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their\ndinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband s absence, was\nnot equal to the task of making the party mix without him.",
      "All were\nsitting like so many priests  wives on a visit (so the old prince\nexpressed it), obviously wondering why they were there, and pumping up\nremarks simply to avoid being silent.",
      "Turovtsin good, simple man felt\nunmistakably a fish out of water, and the smile with which his thick\nlips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said, as plainly as words:  Well, old\nboy, you have popped me down in a learned set!",
      "A drinking party now, or\nthe _Ch teau des Fleurs_, would be more in my line!",
      "The old prince sat\nin silence, his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side, and\nStepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up\nthat politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he\nwere a sturgeon.",
      "Kitty was looking at the door, calling up all her\nenergies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin.",
      "Young Shtcherbatsky, who had not been introduced to Karenin, was trying\nto look as though he were not in the least conscious of it.",
      "Karenin\nhimself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies\nand was wearing evening dress and a white tie.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch saw\nby his face that he had come simply to keep his promise, and was\nperforming a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering.",
      "He\nwas indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all\nthe guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in.",
      "On entering the drawing-room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized, explaining\nthat he had been detained by that prince, who was always the scapegoat\nfor all his absences and unpunctualities, and in one moment he had made\nall the guests acquainted with each other, and, bringing together\nAlexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev, started them on a\ndiscussion of the Russification of Poland, into which they immediately\nplunged with Pestsov.",
      "Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder, he whispered\nsomething comic in his ear, and set him down by his wife and the old\nprince.",
      "Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening,\nand presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin.",
      "In a moment he had so kneaded\ntogether the social dough that the drawing-room became very lively, and\nthere was a merry buzz of voices.",
      "Konstantin Levin was the only person\nwho had not arrived.",
      "But this was so much the better, as going into the\ndining-room, Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and\nsherry had been procured from Depr , and not from Levy, and, directing\nthat the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy s,\nhe was going back to the drawing-room.",
      "In the dining-room he was met by Konstantin Levin.",
      "I m not late?",
      "You can never help being late!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, taking his\narm.",
      "Have you a lot of people?",
      "Who s here?",
      "asked Levin, unable to help\nblushing, as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove.",
      "All our own set.",
      "Kitty s here.",
      "Come along, I ll introduce you to\nKarenin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, for all his liberal views, was well aware that to\nmeet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction, and so\ntreated his best friends to this honor.",
      "But at that instant Konstantin\nLevin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making\nsuch an acquaintance.",
      "He had not seen Kitty since that memorable\nevening when he met Vronsky, not counting, that is, the moment when he\nhad had a glimpse of her on the highroad.",
      "He had known at the bottom of\nhis heart that he would see her here today.",
      "But to keep his thoughts\nfree, he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it.",
      "Now\nwhen he heard that she was here, he was suddenly conscious of such\ndelight, and at the same time of such dread, that his breath failed him\nand he could not utter what he wanted to say.",
      "What is she like, what is she like?",
      "Like what she used to be, or like\nwhat she was in the carriage?",
      "What if Darya Alexandrovna told the\ntruth?",
      "Why shouldn t it be the truth?",
      "he thought.",
      "Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,  he brought out with an effort,\nand with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing-room\nand beheld her.",
      "She was not the same as she used to be, nor was she as she had been in\nthe carriage; she was quite different.",
      "She was scared, shy, shame-faced, and still more charming from it.",
      "She\nsaw him the very instant he walked into the room.",
      "She had been\nexpecting him.",
      "She was delighted, and so confused at her own delight\nthat there was a moment, the moment when he went up to her sister and\nglanced again at her, when she, and he, and Dolly, who saw it all,\nthought she would break down and would begin to cry.",
      "She crimsoned,\nturned white, crimsoned again, and grew faint, waiting with quivering\nlips for him to come to her.",
      "He went up to her, bowed, and held out his\nhand without speaking.",
      "Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the\nmoisture in her eyes that made them brighter, her smile was almost calm\nas she said:\n\n How long it is since we ve seen each other!",
      "and with desperate\ndetermination she pressed his hand with her cold hand.",
      "You ve not seen me, but I ve seen you,  said Levin, with a radiant\nsmile of happiness.",
      "I saw you when you were driving from the railway\nstation to Ergushovo.",
      "When?",
      "she asked, wondering.",
      "You were driving to Ergushovo,  said Levin, feeling as if he would sob\nwith the rapture that was flooding his heart.",
      "And how dared I\nassociate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching\ncreature?",
      "And, yes, I do believe it s true what Darya Alexandrovna told\nme,  he thought.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin.",
      "Let me introduce you.",
      "He mentioned their names.",
      "Very glad to meet you again,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly,\nshaking hands with Levin.",
      "You are acquainted?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise.",
      "We spent three hours together in the train,  said Levin smiling,  but\ngot out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified at least I was.",
      "Nonsense!",
      "Come along, please,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing in\nthe direction of the dining-room.",
      "The men went into the dining-room and went up to a table, laid with six\nsorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese, some with little silver\nspades and some without, caviar, herrings, preserves of various kinds,\nand plates with slices of French bread.",
      "The men stood round the strong-smelling spirits and salt delicacies,\nand the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev,\nKarenin, and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most\nheated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that\nchanged the disposition of his opponent.",
      "He did this now.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of\nPoland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which\nought to be introduced by the Russian government.",
      "Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is\nthe more densely populated.",
      "Koznishev admitted both points, but with limitations.",
      "As they were\ngoing out of the drawing-room to conclude the argument, Koznishev said,\nsmiling:\n\n So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is\nbut one method to bring up as many children as one can.",
      "My brother and\nI are terribly in fault, I see.",
      "You married men, especially you, Stepan\nArkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?",
      "he\nsaid, smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine-glass\nto him.",
      "Everyone laughed, and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor.",
      "Oh, yes, that s the best method!",
      "he said, munching cheese and filling\nthe wine-glass with a special sort of spirit.",
      "The conversation dropped\nat the jest.",
      "This cheese is not bad.",
      "Shall I give you some?",
      "said the master of the\nhouse.",
      "Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?",
      "he asked\nLevin, pinching his muscle with his left hand.",
      "Levin smiled, bent his\narm, and under Stepan Arkadyevitch s fingers the muscles swelled up\nlike a sound cheese, hard as a knob of iron, through the fine cloth of\nthe coat.",
      "What biceps!",
      "A perfect Samson!",
      "I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,  observed Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, who had the mistiest notions about the chase.",
      "He cut\noff and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider-web.",
      "Levin smiled.",
      "Not at all.",
      "Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,  he said,\nwith a slight bow moving aside for the ladies, who were approaching the\ntable.",
      "You have killed a bear, I ve been told!",
      "said Kitty, trying\nassiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip\naway, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm.",
      "Are there\nbears on your place?",
      "she added, turning her charming little head to\nhim and smiling.",
      "There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said, but what\nunutterable meaning there was for him in every sound, in every turn of\nher lips, her eyes, her hand as she said it!",
      "There was entreaty for\nforgiveness, and trust in him, and tenderness soft, timid\ntenderness and promise and hope and love for him, which he could not\nbut believe in and which choked him with happiness.",
      "No, we ve been hunting in the Tver province.",
      "It was coming back from\nthere that I met your _beau-fr re_ in the train, or your _beau-fr re s_\nbrother-in-law,  he said with a smile.",
      "It was an amusing meeting.",
      "And he began telling with droll good-humor how, after not sleeping all\nnight, he had, wearing an old fur-lined, full-skirted coat, got into\nAlexey Alexandrovitch s compartment.",
      "The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on\naccount of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in\nelevated language, and ... you, too,  he said, addressing Karenin and\nforgetting his name,  at first would have ejected me on the ground of\nthe old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely\ngrateful.",
      "The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too\nill-defined,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, rubbing the tips of his\nfingers on his handkerchief.",
      "I saw you were in uncertainty about me,  said Levin, smiling\ngood-naturedly,  but I made haste to plunge into intellectual\nconversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.",
      "Sergey\nIvanovitch, while he kept up a conversation with their hostess, had one\near for his brother, and he glanced askance at him.",
      "What is the matter\nwith him today?",
      "Why such a conquering hero?",
      "he thought.",
      "He did not\nknow that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings.",
      "Levin knew\nshe was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him.",
      "And this was the only thing that interested him.",
      "Not in that room only,\nbut in the whole world, there existed for him only himself, with\nenormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes, and she.",
      "He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy, and far away down\nbelow were all those nice excellent Karenins, Oblonskys, and all the\nworld.",
      "Quite without attracting notice, without glancing at them, as though\nthere were no other places left, Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and\nKitty side by side.",
      "Oh, you may as well sit there,  he said to Levin.",
      "The dinner was as choice as the china, in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was\na connoisseur.",
      "The _soupe Marie-Louise_ was a splendid success; the\ntiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable.",
      "The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the\ndishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly.",
      "On the material\nside the dinner was a success; it was no less so on the immaterial.",
      "The\nconversation, at times general and at times between individuals, never\npaused, and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose\nfrom the table, without stopping speaking, and even Alexey\nAlexandrovitch thawed.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nPestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end, and was not\nsatisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch s words, especially as he felt the\ninjustice of his view.",
      "I did not mean,  he said over the soup, addressing Alexey\nAlexandrovitch,  mere density of population alone, but in conjunction\nwith fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.",
      "It seems to me,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly, and with no\nhaste,  that that s the same thing.",
      "In my opinion, influence over\nanother people is only possible to the people which has the higher\ndevelopment, which....",
      "But that s just the question,  Pestsov broke in in his bass.",
      "He was\nalways in a hurry to speak, and seemed always to put his whole soul\ninto what he was saying.",
      "In what are we to make higher development\nconsist?",
      "The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest\nstage of development?",
      "Which of them will nationalize the other?",
      "We see\nthe Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at\na lower stage!",
      "he shouted.",
      "There is another law at work there.",
      "I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true\ncivilization,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, slightly lifting his\neyebrows.",
      "But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true\ncivilization?",
      "said Pestsov.",
      "I imagine such signs are generally very well known,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "But are they fully known?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle\nsmile.",
      "It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely\nclassical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the\nquestion, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong\npoints in its favor.",
      "You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Will you take red wine?",
      "said\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,  Sergey\nIvanovitch said, holding out his glass with a smile of condescension,\nas to a child.",
      "I only say that both sides have strong arguments to\nsupport them,  he went on, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "My\nsympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am\npersonally unable to arrive at a conclusion.",
      "I see no distinct grounds\nfor classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific\nstudies.",
      "The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,  put in\nPestsov.",
      "Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of\ngeneral principles.",
      "I cannot quite agree with that,  responded Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "It\nseems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the\nforms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual\ndevelopment.",
      "Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the\nclassical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately,\nwith the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and\nnoxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something, but Pestsov interrupted\nhim in his rich bass.",
      "He began warmly contesting the justice of this\nview.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak, obviously with a\nconvincing reply ready.",
      "But,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling subtly, and addressing Karenin,\n One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of\nclassical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question\nwhich form of education was to be preferred would not have been so\nquickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of\nclassical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral _disons le\nmot_ anti-nihilist influence.",
      "Undoubtedly.",
      "If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic\ninfluence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered\nthe subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,  said\nSergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile,  we should have given elbow-room\nto both tendencies.",
      "But now we know that these little pills of\nclassical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and\nwe boldly prescribe them to our patients....",
      "But what if they had no\nsuch medicinal property?",
      "he wound up humorously.",
      "At Sergey Ivanovitch s little pills, everyone laughed; Turovtsin in\nespecial roared loudly and jovially, glad at last to have found\nsomething to laugh at, all he ever looked for in listening to\nconversation.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov.",
      "With\nPestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant.",
      "Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his\njest, Pestsov promptly started a new one.",
      "I can t agree even,  said he,  that the government had that aim.",
      "The\ngovernment obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains\nindifferent to the influence its measures may exercise.",
      "The education\nof women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be\nharmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.",
      "And the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education\nof women.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is\napt to be confounded with the emancipation of women, and that it is\nonly so that it can be considered dangerous.",
      "I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably\nconnected together,  said Pestsov;  it is a vicious circle.",
      "Woman is\ndeprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education\nresults from the absence of rights.",
      "We must not forget that the\nsubjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that\nwe are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from\nus,  said he.",
      "You said rights,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till Pestsov had\nfinished,  meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of\npresiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil\nservice, of sitting in parliament....",
      "Undoubtedly.",
      "But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems\nto me you are wrong in using the expression  rights.",
      "It would be more\ncorrect to say duties.",
      "Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a\njuryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing\nduties.",
      "And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking\nduties, and quite legitimately.",
      "And one can but sympathize with this\ndesire to assist in the general labor of man.",
      "Quite so,  Alexey Alexandrovitch assented.",
      "The question, I imagine,\nis simply whether they are fitted for such duties.",
      "They will most likely be perfectly fitted,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n when education has become general among them.",
      "We see this.... \n\n How about the proverb?",
      "said the prince, who had a long while been\nintent on the conversation, his little comical eyes twinkling.",
      "I can\nsay it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is.... \n\n Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!",
      "said\nPestsov angrily.",
      "What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,  said\nSergey Ivanovitch,  while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to\navoid them.",
      "Duties are bound up with rights power, money, honor; those are what\nwomen are seeking,  said Pestsov.",
      "Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel\ninjured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take\nme,  said the old prince.",
      "Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch\nregretted that he had not made this comparison.",
      "Even Alexey\nAlexandrovitch smiled.",
      "Yes, but a man can t nurse a baby,  said Pestsov,  while a woman.... \n\n No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship, \nsaid the old prince, feeling this freedom in conversation permissible\nbefore his own daughters.",
      "There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials, \nsaid Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?",
      "put in Stepan\nArkadyevitch, thinking of Masha Tchibisova, whom he had had in his mind\nall along, in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him.",
      "If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she\nhad abandoned a family her own or a sister s, where she might have\nfound a woman s duties,  Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a\ntone of exasperation, probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan\nArkadyevitch was thinking of.",
      "But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,  replied Pestsov in\nhis mellow bass.",
      "Woman desires to have rights, to be independent,\neducated.",
      "She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her\ndisabilities.",
      "And I m oppressed and humiliated that they won t engage me at the\nFoundling,  the old prince said again, to the huge delight of\nTurovtsin, who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in\nthe sauce.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nEveryone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin.",
      "At\nfirst, when they were talking of the influence that one people has on\nanother, there rose to Levin s mind what he had to say on the subject.",
      "But these ideas, once of such importance in his eyes, seemed to come\ninto his brain as in a dream, and had now not the slightest interest\nfor him.",
      "It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to\ntalk of what was of no use to anyone.",
      "Kitty, too, should, one would\nhave supposed, have been interested in what they were saying of the\nrights and education of women.",
      "How often she had mused on the subject,\nthinking of her friend abroad, Varenka, of her painful state of\ndependence, how often she had wondered about herself what would become\nof her if she did not marry, and how often she had argued with her\nsister about it!",
      "But it did not interest her at all.",
      "She and Levin had\na conversation of their own, yet not a conversation, but some sort of\nmysterious communication, which brought them every moment nearer, and\nstirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which\nthey were entering.",
      "At first Levin, in answer to Kitty s question how he could have seen\nher last year in the carriage, told her how he had been coming home\nfrom the mowing along the highroad and had met her.",
      "It was very, very early in the morning.",
      "You were probably only just\nawake.",
      "Your mother was asleep in the corner.",
      "It was an exquisite\nmorning.",
      "I was walking along wondering who it could be in a\nfour-in-hand?",
      "It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a\nsecond you flashed by, and I saw you at the window you were sitting\nlike this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking\nawfully deeply about something,  he said, smiling.",
      "How I should like\nto know what you were thinking about then!",
      "Something important?",
      "Wasn t I dreadfully untidy?",
      "she wondered, but seeing the smile of\necstasy these reminiscences called up, she felt that the impression she\nhad made had been very good.",
      "She blushed and laughed with delight;\n Really I don t remember.",
      "How nicely Turovtsin laughs!",
      "said Levin, admiring his moist eyes and\nshaking chest.",
      "Have you known him long?",
      "asked Kitty.",
      "Oh, everyone knows him!",
      "And I see you think he s a horrid man?",
      "Not horrid, but nothing in him.",
      "Oh, you re wrong!",
      "And you must give up thinking so directly!",
      "said\nKitty.",
      "I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he s an\nawfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man.",
      "He has a heart of gold.",
      "How could you find out what sort of heart he has?",
      "We are great friends.",
      "I know him very well.",
      "Last winter, soon after\n... you came to see us,  she said, with a guilty and at the same time\nconfiding smile,  all Dolly s children had scarlet fever, and he\nhappened to come and see her.",
      "And only fancy,  she said in a whisper,\n he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look\nafter the children.",
      "Yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and\nlooked after the children like a nurse.",
      "I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet\nfever,  she said, bending over to her sister.",
      "Yes, it was wonderful, noble!",
      "said Dolly, glancing towards Turovtsin,\nwho had become aware they were talking of him, and smiling gently to\nhim.",
      "Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin, and wondered how it was he\nhad not realized all this man s goodness before.",
      "I m sorry, I m sorry, and I ll never think ill of people again!",
      "he\nsaid gaily, genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nConnected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of\nwomen there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in\nmarriage improper to discuss before the ladies.",
      "Pestsov had several\ntimes during dinner touched upon these questions, but Sergey Ivanovitch\nand Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them.",
      "When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out, Pestsov did\nnot follow them, but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch, began to expound\nthe chief ground of inequality.",
      "The inequality in marriage, in his\nopinion, lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and the\ninfidelity of the husband are punished unequally, both by the law and\nby public opinion.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch and offered him a cigar.",
      "No, I don t smoke,  Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly, and as\nthough purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject,\nhe turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile.",
      "I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of\nthings,  he said, and would have gone on to the drawing-room.",
      "But at\nthis point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the\nconversation, addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?",
      "said Turovtsin, warmed up by\nthe champagne he had drunk, and long waiting for an opportunity to\nbreak the silence that had weighed on him.",
      "Vasya Pryatchnikov,  he\nsaid, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red lips, addressing\nhimself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch,\n they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has\nkilled him.",
      "Just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place, so\nStepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck\nfall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch s sore spot.",
      "He would again\nhave got his brother-in-law away, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself\ninquired, with curiosity:\n\n What did Pryatchnikov fight about?",
      "His wife.",
      "Acted like a man, he did!",
      "Called him out and shot him!",
      "Ah!",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently, and lifting his\neyebrows, he went into the drawing-room.",
      "How glad I am you have come,  Dolly said with a frightened smile,\nmeeting him in the outer drawing-room.",
      "I must talk to you.",
      "Let s sit\nhere.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, with the same expression of indifference, given\nhim by his lifted eyebrows, sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna, and\nsmiled affectedly.",
      "It s fortunate,  said he,  especially as I was meaning to ask you to\nexcuse me, and to be taking leave.",
      "I have to start tomorrow.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna s innocence, and she\nfelt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this\nfrigid, unfeeling man, who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent\nfriend.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch,  she said, with desperate resolution looking\nhim in the face,  I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer.",
      "How is\nshe?",
      "She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna,  replied Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, not looking at her.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna\nas a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is\nwrong between you?",
      "what fault do you find with her?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned, and almost closing his eyes, dropped his\nhead.",
      "I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I\nconsider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "he\nsaid, not looking her in the face, but eyeing with displeasure\nShtcherbatsky, who was walking across the drawing-room.",
      "I don t believe it, I don t believe it, I can t believe it!",
      "Dolly\nsaid, clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture.",
      "She\nrose quickly, and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch s sleeve.",
      "We\nshall be disturbed here.",
      "Come this way, please.",
      "Dolly s agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He got up and\nsubmissively followed her to the schoolroom.",
      "They sat down to a table\ncovered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives.",
      "I don t, I don t believe it!",
      "Dolly said, trying to catch his glance\nthat avoided her.",
      "One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,  said he, with an\nemphasis on the word  facts.",
      "But what has she done?",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "What precisely has\nshe done?",
      "She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband.",
      "That s what she\nhas done,  said he.",
      "No, no, it can t be!",
      "No, for God s sake, you are mistaken,  said\nDolly, putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly, with his lips alone, meaning to\nsignify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction; but this\nwarm defense, though it could not shake him, reopened his wound.",
      "He\nbegan to speak with greater heat.",
      "It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs\nher husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life, and a\nson, all that s a mistake, and that she wants to begin life again,  he\nsaid angrily, with a snort.",
      "Anna and sin I cannot connect them, I cannot believe it!",
      "Darya Alexandrovna,  he said, now looking straight into Dolly s\nkindly, troubled face, and feeling that his tongue was being loosened\nin spite of himself,  I would give a great deal for doubt to be still\npossible.",
      "When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was better than now.",
      "When I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope, and still I doubt\nof everything.",
      "I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my\nson, and sometimes do not believe he is my son.",
      "I am very unhappy.",
      "He had no need to say that.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as\nhe glanced into her face; and she felt sorry for him, and her faith in\nthe innocence of her friend began to totter.",
      "Oh, this is awful, awful!",
      "But can it be true that you are resolved on\na divorce?",
      "I am resolved on extreme measures.",
      "There is nothing else for me to\ndo.",
      "Nothing else to do, nothing else to do....  she replied, with tears in\nher eyes.",
      "Oh no, don t say nothing else to do!",
      "she said.",
      "What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in\nany other in loss, in death bear one s trouble in peace, but that one\nmust act,  said he, as though guessing her thought.",
      "One must get out\nof the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can t live _ \ntrois_.",
      "I understand, I quite understand that,  said Dolly, and her head sank.",
      "She was silent for a little, thinking of herself, of her own grief in\nher family, and all at once, with an impulsive movement, she raised her\nhead and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture.",
      "But wait a\nlittle!",
      "You are a Christian.",
      "Think of her!",
      "What will become of her, if\nyou cast her off?",
      "I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great deal,  said\nAlexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "His face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes\nlooked straight before him.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied\nhim with all her heart.",
      "That was what I did indeed when she herself\nmade known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old.",
      "I gave\nher a chance to reform, I tried to save her.",
      "And with what result?",
      "She\nwould not regard the slightest request that she should observe\ndecorum,  he said, getting heated.",
      "One may save anyone who does not\nwant to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt, so depraved,\nthat ruin itself seems to be her salvation, what s to be done?",
      "Anything, only not divorce!",
      "answered Darya Alexandrovna\n\n But what is anything?",
      "No, it is awful!",
      "She will be no one s wife, she will be lost!",
      "What can I do?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, raising his shoulders and\nhis eyebrows.",
      "The recollection of his wife s last act had so incensed\nhim that he had become frigid, as at the beginning of the conversation.",
      "I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I must be going,  he said,\ngetting up.",
      "No, wait a minute.",
      "You must not ruin her.",
      "Wait a little; I will tell\nyou about myself.",
      "I was married, and my husband deceived me; in anger\nand jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would myself....",
      "But\nI came to myself again; and who did it?",
      "Anna saved me.",
      "And here I am\nliving on.",
      "The children are growing up, my husband has come back to his\nfamily, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better, and I live\non....",
      "I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her, but her words had no effect on him\nnow.",
      "All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had\nsprung up again in his soul.",
      "He shook himself, and said in a shrill,\nloud voice:\n\n Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong.",
      "I have\ndone everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the mud\nto which she is akin.",
      "I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated\nanyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive\nher, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me!",
      "he\nsaid, with tones of hatred in his voice.",
      "Love those that hate you....  Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously.",
      "That he knew long ago, but\nit could not be applied to his case.",
      "Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.",
      "Forgive me for having troubled you.",
      "Everyone has enough to bear in his\nown grief!",
      "And regaining his self-possession, Alexey Alexandrovitch\nquietly took leave and went away.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nWhen they rose from table, Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into\nthe drawing-room; but he was afraid she might dislike this, as too\nobviously paying her attention.",
      "He remained in the little ring of men,\ntaking part in the general conversation, and without looking at Kitty,\nhe was aware of her movements, her looks, and the place where she was\nin the drawing-room.",
      "He did at once, and without the smallest effort, keep the promise he\nhad made her always to think well of all men, and to like everyone\nalways.",
      "The conversation fell on the village commune, in which Pestsov\nsaw a sort of special principle, called by him the  choral  principle.",
      "Levin did not agree with Pestsov, nor with his brother, who had a\nspecial attitude of his own, both admitting and not admitting the\nsignificance of the Russian commune.",
      "But he talked to them, simply\ntrying to reconcile and soften their differences.",
      "He was not in the\nleast interested in what he said himself, and even less so in what they\nsaid; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and\ncontented.",
      "He knew now the one thing of importance; and that one thing\nwas at first there, in the drawing-room, and then began moving across\nand came to a standstill at the door.",
      "Without turning round he felt the\neyes fixed on him, and the smile, and he could not help turning round.",
      "She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky, looking at him.",
      "I thought you were going towards the piano,  said he, going up to her.",
      "That s something I miss in the country music.",
      "No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,  she said, rewarding him\nwith a smile that was like a gift,  for coming.",
      "What do they want to\nargue for?",
      "No one ever convinces anyone, you know.",
      "Yes; that s true,  said Levin;  it generally happens that one argues\nwarmly simply because one can t make out what one s opponent wants to\nprove.",
      "Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent\npeople that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of\nlogical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being\naware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one\nanother had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to\nboth, but that they liked different things, and would not define what\nthey liked for fear of its being attacked.",
      "He had often had the\nexperience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his\nopponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found\nhimself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless.",
      "Sometimes, too, he had experienced the opposite, expressing at last\nwhat he liked himself, which he was devising arguments to defend, and,\nchancing to express it well and genuinely, he had found his opponent at\nonce agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position.",
      "He tried to say\nthis.",
      "She knitted her brow, trying to understand.",
      "But directly he began to\nillustrate his meaning, she understood at once.",
      "I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to\nhim, then one can.... \n\nShe had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea.",
      "Levin smiled joyfully; he was struck by this transition from the\nconfused, verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this\nlaconic, clear, almost wordless communication of the most complex\nideas.",
      "Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a\ncard-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging\ncircles over the new green cloth.",
      "They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the\nliberty and occupations of women.",
      "Levin was of the opinion of Darya\nAlexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman s duties\nin a family.",
      "He supported this view by the fact that no family can get\non without women to help; that in every family, poor or rich, there are\nand must be nurses, either relations or hired.",
      "No,  said Kitty, blushing, but looking at him all the more boldly with\nher truthful eyes;  a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live\nin the family without humiliation, while she herself.... \n\nAt the hint he understood her.",
      "Oh, yes,  he said.",
      "Yes, yes, yes you re right; you re right!",
      "And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the\nliberty of woman, simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old\nmaid s existence and its humiliation in Kitty s heart; and loving her,\nhe felt that terror and humiliation, and at once gave up his arguments.",
      "A silence followed.",
      "She was still drawing with the chalk on the table.",
      "Her eyes were shining with a soft light.",
      "Under the influence of her\nmood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of\nhappiness.",
      "Ah!",
      "I ve scribbled all over the table!",
      "she said, and, laying down the\nchalk, she made a movement as though to get up.",
      "What!",
      "shall I be left alone without her?",
      "he thought with horror, and\nhe took the chalk.",
      "Wait a minute,  he said, sitting down to the table.",
      "I ve long wanted to ask you one thing.",
      "He looked straight into her caressing, though frightened eyes.",
      "Please, ask it.",
      "Here,  he said; and he wrote the initial letters, _w, y, t, m, i, c,\nn, b, d, t, m, n, o, t_.",
      "These letters meant,  When you told me it\ncould never be, did that mean never, or then?",
      "There seemed no\nlikelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence; but he\nlooked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the\nwords.",
      "She glanced at him seriously, then leaned her puckered brow on\nher hands and began to read.",
      "Once or twice she stole a look at him, as\nthough asking him,  Is it what I think?",
      "I understand,  she said, flushing a little.",
      "What is this word?",
      "he said, pointing to the _n_ that stood for\n_never_.",
      "It means _never_,  she said;  but that s not true!",
      "He quickly rubbed out what he had written, gave her the chalk, and\nstood up.",
      "She wrote, _t, i, c, n, a, d_.",
      "Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her\nconversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the\ntwo figures: Kitty with the chalk in her hand, with a shy and happy\nsmile looking upwards at Levin, and his handsome figure bending over\nthe table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the\nnext on her.",
      "He was suddenly radiant: he had understood.",
      "It meant,\n Then I could not answer differently.",
      "He glanced at her questioningly, timidly.",
      "Only then?",
      "Yes,  her smile answered.",
      "And n... and now?",
      "he asked.",
      "Well, read this.",
      "I ll tell you what I should like should like so\nmuch!",
      "she wrote the initial letters, _i, y, c, f, a, f, w, h._ This\nmeant,  If you could forget and forgive what happened.",
      "He snatched the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, and breaking it,\nwrote the initial letters of the following phrase,  I have nothing to\nforget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.",
      "She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver.",
      "I understand,  she said in a whisper.",
      "He sat down and wrote a long phrase.",
      "She understood it all, and without\nasking him,  Is it this?",
      "took the chalk and at once answered.",
      "For a long while he could not understand what she had written, and\noften looked into her eyes.",
      "He was stupefied with happiness.",
      "He could\nnot supply the word she had meant; but in her charming eyes, beaming\nwith happiness, he saw all he needed to know.",
      "And he wrote three\nletters.",
      "But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her\narm, and herself finished and wrote the answer,  Yes.",
      "You re playing _secr taire_?",
      "said the old prince.",
      "But we must really\nbe getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.",
      "Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door.",
      "In their conversation everything had been said; it had been said that\nshe loved him, and that she would tell her father and mother that he\nwould come tomorrow morning.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nWhen Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone, he felt such uneasiness\nwithout her, and such an impatient longing to get as quickly, as\nquickly as possible, to tomorrow morning, when he would see her again\nand be plighted to her forever, that he felt afraid, as though of\ndeath, of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her.",
      "It was essential for him to be with someone to talk to, so as not to be\nleft alone, to kill time.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch would have been the\ncompanion most congenial to him, but he was going out, he said, to a\n_soir e_, in reality to the ballet.",
      "Levin only had time to tell him he\nwas happy, and that he loved him, and would never, never forget what he\nhad done for him.",
      "The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed\nLevin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly.",
      "Oh, so it s not time to die yet?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, pressing\nLevin s hand with emotion.",
      "N-n-no!",
      "said Levin.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna too, as she said good-bye to him, gave him a sort of\ncongratulation, saying,  How glad I am you have met Kitty again!",
      "One\nmust value old friends.",
      "Levin did not like these words of Darya\nAlexandrovna s. She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it\nall was, and she ought not to have dared to allude to it.",
      "Levin said\ngood-bye to them, but, not to be left alone, he attached himself to his\nbrother.",
      "Where are you going?",
      "I m going to a meeting.",
      "Well, I ll come with you.",
      "May I?",
      "What for?",
      "Yes, come along,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling.",
      "What is\nthe matter with you today?",
      "With me?",
      "Happiness is the matter with me!",
      "said Levin, letting down\nthe window of the carriage they were driving in.",
      "You don t mind?",
      "it s\nso stifling.",
      "It s happiness is the matter with me!",
      "Why is it you have\nnever married?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled.",
      "I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....  Sergey Ivanovitch was\nbeginning.",
      "Don t say it!",
      "don t say it!",
      "shouted Levin, clutching at the collar of\nhis fur coat with both hands, and muffling him up in it.",
      "She s a nice\ngirl  were such simple, humble words, so out of harmony with his\nfeeling.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh, which was rare with\nhim.",
      "Well, anyway, I may say that I m very glad of it.",
      "That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more!",
      "Nothing, nothing,\nsilence,  said Levin, and muffling him once more in his fur coat, he\nadded:  I do like you so!",
      "Well, is it possible for me to be present at\nthe meeting?",
      "Of course it is.",
      "What is your discussion about today?",
      "asked Levin, never ceasing\nsmiling.",
      "They arrived at the meeting.",
      "Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly\nread the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand; but\nLevin saw from this secretary s face what a good, nice, kind-hearted\nperson he was.",
      "This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in\nreading the minutes.",
      "Then the discussion began.",
      "They were disputing\nabout the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain\npipes, and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members, and said\nsomething at great length with an air of triumph; and another member,\nscribbling something on a bit of paper, began timidly at first, but\nafterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully.",
      "And then\nSviazhsky (he was there too) said something too, very handsomely and\nnobly.",
      "Levin listened to them, and saw clearly that these missing sums\nand these pipes were not anything real, and that they were not at all\nangry, but were all the nicest, kindest people, and everything was as\nhappy and charming as possible among them.",
      "They did no harm to anyone,\nand were all enjoying it.",
      "What struck Levin was that he could see\nthrough them all today, and from little, almost imperceptible signs\nknew the soul of each, and saw distinctly that they were all good at\nheart.",
      "And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of\nthat day.",
      "That was evident from the way they spoke to him, from the\nfriendly, affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him.",
      "Well, did you like it?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch asked him.",
      "Very much.",
      "I never supposed it was so interesting!",
      "Capital!",
      "Splendid!",
      "Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with\nhim.",
      "Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he\nhad disliked in Sviazhsky, what he had failed to find in him.",
      "He was a\nclever and wonderfully good-hearted man.",
      "Most delighted,  he said, and asked after his wife and sister-in-law.",
      "And from a queer association of ideas, because in his imagination the\nidea of Sviazhsky s sister-in-law was connected with marriage, it\noccurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably\nspeak of his happiness, and he was very glad to go and see them.",
      "Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate,\npresupposing, as he always did, that there was no possibility of doing\nanything not done already in Europe, and now this did not in the least\nannoy Levin.",
      "On the contrary, he felt that Sviazhsky was right, that\nthe whole business was of little value, and he saw the wonderful\nsoftness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully\nexpressing his correct view.",
      "The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were\nparticularly delightful.",
      "It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it\nalready and sympathized with him, saying nothing merely from delicacy.",
      "He stayed with them one hour, two, three, talking of all sorts of\nsubjects but the one thing that filled his heart, and did not observe\nthat he was boring them dreadfully, and that it was long past their\nbedtime.",
      "Sviazhsky went with him into the hall, yawning and wondering at the\nstrange humor his friend was in.",
      "It was past one o clock.",
      "Levin went\nback to his hotel, and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now\nwith his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through.",
      "The\nservant, whose turn it was to be up all night, lighted his candles, and\nwould have gone away, but Levin stopped him.",
      "This servant, Yegor, whom\nLevin had noticed before, struck him as a very intelligent, excellent,\nand, above all, good-hearted man.",
      "Well, Yegor, it s hard work not sleeping, isn t it?",
      "One s got to put up with it!",
      "It s part of our work, you see.",
      "In a\ngentleman s house it s easier; but then here one makes more.",
      "It appeared that Yegor had a family, three boys and a daughter, a\nsempstress, whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler s shop.",
      "Levin, on hearing this, informed Yegor that, in his opinion, in\nmarriage the great thing was love, and that with love one would always\nbe happy, for happiness rests only on oneself.",
      "Yegor listened attentively, and obviously quite took in Levin s idea,\nbut by way of assent to it he enunciated, greatly to Levin s surprise,\nthe observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always\nbeen satisfied with his masters, and now was perfectly satisfied with\nhis employer, though he was a Frenchman.",
      "Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!",
      "thought Levin.",
      "Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your\nwife?",
      "Ay!",
      "and why not?",
      "responded Yegor.",
      "And Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to\nexpress all his most heartfelt emotions.",
      "My life, too, has been a wonderful one.",
      "From a child up....  he was\nbeginning with flashing eyes, apparently catching Levin s enthusiasm,\njust as people catch yawning.",
      "But at that moment a ring was heard.",
      "Yegor departed, and Levin was left\nalone.",
      "He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner, had refused tea and\nsupper at Sviazhsky s, but he was incapable of thinking of supper.",
      "He\nhad not slept the previous night, but was incapable of thinking of\nsleep either.",
      "His room was cold, but he was oppressed by heat.",
      "He\nopened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table\nopposite the open panes.",
      "Over the snow-covered roofs could be seen a\ndecorated cross with chains, and above it the rising triangle of\nCharles s Wain with the yellowish light of Capella.",
      "He gazed at the\ncross, then at the stars, drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed\nevenly into the room, and followed as though in a dream the images and\nmemories that rose in his imagination.",
      "At four o clock he heard steps\nin the passage and peeped out at the door.",
      "It was the gambler Myaskin,\nwhom he knew, coming from the club.",
      "He walked gloomily, frowning and\ncoughing.",
      "Poor, unlucky fellow!",
      "thought Levin, and tears came into\nhis eyes from love and pity for this man.",
      "He would have talked with\nhim, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but\nhis shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane\nto bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross,\nsilent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow\nstar.",
      "At seven o clock there was a noise of people polishing the\nfloors, and bells ringing in some servants  department, and Levin felt\nthat he was beginning to get frozen.",
      "He closed the pane, washed,\ndressed, and went out into the street.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nThe streets were still empty.",
      "Levin went to the house of the\nShtcherbatskys.",
      "The visitors  doors were closed and everything was\nasleep.",
      "He walked back, went into his room again, and asked for coffee.",
      "The day servant, not Yegor this time, brought it to him.",
      "Levin would\nhave entered into conversation with him, but a bell rang for the\nservant, and he went out.",
      "Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll\nin his mouth, but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the\nroll.",
      "Levin, rejecting the roll, put on his coat and went out again for\na walk.",
      "It was nine o clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys  steps\nthe second time.",
      "In the house they were only just up, and the cook came\nout to go marketing.",
      "He had to get through at least two hours more.",
      "All that night and morning Levin lived perfectly unconsciously, and\nfelt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life.",
      "He had\neaten nothing for a whole day, he had not slept for two nights, had\nspent several hours undressed in the frozen air, and felt not simply\nfresher and stronger than ever, but felt utterly independent of his\nbody; he moved without muscular effort, and felt as if he could do\nanything.",
      "He was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of\nthe house, if need be.",
      "He spent the remainder of the time in the\nstreet, incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him.",
      "And what he saw then, he never saw again after.",
      "The children especially\ngoing to school, the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the\npavement, and the little loaves covered with flour, thrust out by an\nunseen hand, touched him.",
      "Those loaves, those doves, and those two boys\nwere not earthly creatures.",
      "It all happened at the same time: a boy ran\ntowards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin; the dove, with a whir of\nher wings, darted away, flashing in the sun, amid grains of snow that\nquivered in the air, while from a little window there came a smell of\nfresh-baked bread, and the loaves were put out.",
      "All of this together\nwas so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight.",
      "Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka, he went back\nagain to the hotel, and putting his watch before him, he sat down to\nwait for twelve o clock.",
      "In the next room they were talking about some\nsort of machines, and swindling, and coughing their morning coughs.",
      "They did not realize that the hand was near twelve.",
      "The hand reached\nit.",
      "Levin went out onto the steps.",
      "The sledge-drivers clearly knew all\nabout it.",
      "They crowded round Levin with happy faces, quarreling among\nthemselves, and offering their services.",
      "Trying not to offend the other\nsledge drivers, and promising to drive with them too, Levin took one\nand told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys .",
      "The sledge-driver was\nsplendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and\ninto his strong, full-blooded red neck.",
      "The sledge was high and\ncomfortable, and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after,\nand the horse was a good one, and tried to gallop but didn t seem to\nmove.",
      "The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys  house, and drew up at the\nentrance with a curve of his arm and a  Wo!",
      "especially indicative of\nrespect for his fare.",
      "The Shtcherbatskys  hall-porter certainly knew\nall about it.",
      "This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way\nhe said:\n\n Well, it s a long while since you ve been to see us, Konstantin\nDmitrievitch!",
      "Not only he knew all about it, but he was unmistakably delighted and\nmaking efforts to conceal his joy.",
      "Looking into his kindly old eyes,\nLevin realized even something new in his happiness.",
      "Are they up?",
      "Pray walk in!",
      "Leave it here,  said he, smiling, as Levin would have\ncome back to take his hat.",
      "That meant something.",
      "To whom shall I announce your honor?",
      "asked the footman.",
      "The footman, though a young man, and one of the new school of footmen,\na dandy, was a very kind-hearted, good fellow, and he too knew all\nabout it.",
      "The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....  said Levin.",
      "The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon.",
      "She walked across the\nroom, and her ringlets and her face were beaming.",
      "He had only just\nspoken to her, when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the\ndoor, and Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin s eyes, and a joyful\nterror came over him at the nearness of his happiness.",
      "Mademoiselle\nLinon was in great haste, and leaving him, went out at the other door.",
      "Directly she had gone out, swift, swift light steps sounded on the\nparquet, and his bliss, his life, himself what was best in himself,\nwhat he had so long sought and longed for was quickly, so quickly\napproaching him.",
      "She did not walk, but seemed, by some unseen force, to\nfloat to him.",
      "He saw nothing but her clear, truthful eyes, frightened\nby the same bliss of love that flooded his heart.",
      "Those eyes were\nshining nearer and nearer, blinding him with their light of love.",
      "She\nstopped still close to him, touching him.",
      "Her hands rose and dropped\nonto his shoulders.",
      "She had done all she could she had run up to him and given herself up\nentirely, shy and happy.",
      "He put his arms round her and pressed his lips\nto her mouth that sought his kiss.",
      "She too had not slept all night, and had been expecting him all the\nmorning.",
      "Her mother and father had consented without demur, and were happy in\nher happiness.",
      "She had been waiting for him.",
      "She wanted to be the first\nto tell him her happiness and his.",
      "She had got ready to see him alone,\nand had been delighted at the idea, and had been shy and ashamed, and\ndid not know herself what she was doing.",
      "She had heard his steps and\nvoice, and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go.",
      "Mademoiselle Linon had gone away.",
      "Without thinking, without asking\nherself how and what, she had gone up to him, and did as she was doing.",
      "Let us go to mamma!",
      "she said, taking him by the hand.",
      "For a long\nwhile he could say nothing, not so much because he was afraid of\ndesecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word, as that every time\nhe tried to say something, instead of words he felt that tears of\nhappiness were welling up.",
      "He took her hand and kissed it.",
      "Can it be true?",
      "he said at last in a choked voice.",
      "I can t believe\nyou love me, dear!",
      "She smiled at that  dear,  and at the timidity with which he glanced at\nher.",
      "Yes!",
      "she said significantly, deliberately.",
      "I am so happy!",
      "Not letting go his hands, she went into the drawing-room.",
      "The princess,\nseeing them, breathed quickly, and immediately began to cry and then\nimmediately began to laugh, and with a vigorous step Levin had not\nexpected, ran up to him, and hugging his head, kissed him, wetting his\ncheeks with her tears.",
      "So it is all settled!",
      "I am glad.",
      "Love her.",
      "I am glad.... Kitty!",
      "You ve not been long settling things,  said the old prince, trying to\nseem unmoved; but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned\nto him.",
      "I ve long, always wished for this!",
      "said the prince, taking Levin by\nthe arm and drawing him towards himself.",
      "Even when this little\nfeather-head fancied.... \n\n Papa!",
      "shrieked Kitty, and shut his mouth with her hands.",
      "Well, I won t!",
      "he said.",
      "I m very, very ... plea... Oh, what a fool I\nam....",
      "He embraced Kitty, kissed her face, her hand, her face again, and made\nthe sign of the cross over her.",
      "And there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man, till then\nso little known to him, when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty\nkissed his muscular hand.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nThe princess sat in her armchair, silent and smiling; the prince sat\ndown beside her.",
      "Kitty stood by her father s chair, still holding his\nhand.",
      "All were silent.",
      "The princess was the first to put everything into words, and to\ntranslate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions.",
      "And all\nequally felt this strange and painful for the first minute.",
      "When is it to be?",
      "We must have the benediction and announcement.",
      "And\nwhen s the wedding to be?",
      "What do you think, Alexander?",
      "Here he is,  said the old prince, pointing to Levin he s the\nprincipal person in the matter.",
      "When?",
      "said Levin blushing.",
      "Tomorrow.",
      "If you ask me, I should say,\nthe benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.",
      "Come, _mon cher_, that s nonsense!",
      "Well, in a week.",
      "He s quite mad.",
      "No, why so?",
      "Well, upon my word!",
      "said the mother, smiling, delighted at this\nhaste.",
      "How about the trousseau?",
      "Will there really be a trousseau and all that?",
      "Levin thought with\nhorror.",
      "But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that can it\nspoil my happiness?",
      "Nothing can spoil it!",
      "He glanced at Kitty, and\nnoticed that she was not in the least, not in the very least, disturbed\nby the idea of the trousseau.",
      "Then it must be all right,  he thought.",
      "Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like,  he said\napologetically.",
      "We ll talk it over, then.",
      "The benediction and announcement can take\nplace now.",
      "That s very well.",
      "The princess went up to her husband, kissed him, and would have gone\naway, but he kept her, embraced her, and, tenderly as a young lover,\nkissed her several times, smiling.",
      "The old people were obviously\nmuddled for a moment, and did not quite know whether it was they who\nwere in love again or their daughter.",
      "When the prince and the princess\nhad gone, Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand.",
      "He was\nself-possessed now and could speak, and he had a great deal he wanted\nto tell her.",
      "But he said not at all what he had to say.",
      "How I knew it would be so!",
      "I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I\nwas always sure,  he said.",
      "I believe that it was ordained.",
      "And I!",
      "she said.",
      "Even when....  She stopped and went on again,\nlooking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes,  Even when I thrust\nfrom me my happiness.",
      "I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.",
      "I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?",
      "Perhaps it was for the best.",
      "You will have to forgive me so much.",
      "I\nought to tell you....",
      "This was one of the things he had meant to speak about.",
      "He had resolved\nfrom the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she\nwas, and that he was not a believer.",
      "It was agonizing, but he\nconsidered he ought to tell her both these facts.",
      "No, not now, later!",
      "he said.",
      "Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me.",
      "I m not afraid of\nanything.",
      "I want to know everything.",
      "Now it is settled.",
      "He added:  Settled that you ll take me whatever I may be you won t give\nme up?",
      "Yes?",
      "Yes, yes.",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon, who with an\naffected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil.",
      "Before she had gone, the servants came in with their congratulations.",
      "Then relations arrived, and there began that state of blissful\nabsurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his\nwedding.",
      "Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort,\nbut the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing.",
      "He\nfelt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what, he\ndid not know; and he did everything he was told, and it all gave him\nhappiness.",
      "He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it\nlike others, that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would\nspoil his special happiness; but it ended in his doing exactly as other\npeople did, and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming\nmore and more special, more and more unlike anything that had ever\nhappened.",
      "Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,  said Mademoiselle Linon and\nLevin drove off to buy sweetmeats.",
      "Well, I m very glad,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "I advise you to get the\nbouquets from Fomin s. \n\n Oh, are they wanted?",
      "And he drove to Fomin s.\n\nHis brother offered to lend him money, as he would have so many\nexpenses, presents to give....\n\n Oh, are presents wanted?",
      "And he galloped to Foulde s.\n\nAnd at the confectioner s, and at Fomin s, and at Foulde s he saw that\nhe was expected; that they were pleased to see him, and prided\nthemselves on his happiness, just as everyone whom he had to do with\nduring those days.",
      "What was extraordinary was that everyone not only\nliked him, but even people previously unsympathetic, cold, and callous,\nwere enthusiastic over him, gave way to him in everything, treated his\nfeeling with tenderness and delicacy, and shared his conviction that he\nwas the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond\nperfection.",
      "Kitty too felt the same thing.",
      "When Countess Nordston\nventured to hint that she had hoped for something better, Kitty was so\nangry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be\nbetter than Levin, that Countess Nordston had to admit it, and in\nKitty s presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic\nadmiration.",
      "The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this\ntime.",
      "He consulted the old prince, and with his sanction gave Kitty his\ndiary, in which there was written the confession that tortured him.",
      "He\nhad written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife.",
      "Two\nthings caused him anguish: his lack of purity and his lack of faith.",
      "His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed.",
      "She was religious, had\nnever doubted the truths of religion, but his external unbelief did not\naffect her in the least.",
      "Through love she knew all his soul, and in his\nsoul she saw what she wanted, and that such a state of soul should be\ncalled unbelieving was to her a matter of no account.",
      "The other\nconfession set her weeping bitterly.",
      "Levin, not without an inner struggle, handed her his diary.",
      "He knew\nthat between him and her there could not be, and should not be,\nsecrets, and so he had decided that so it must be.",
      "But he had not\nrealized what an effect it would have on her, he had not put himself in\nher place.",
      "It was only when the same evening he came to their house\nbefore the theater, went into her room and saw her tear-stained,\npitiful, sweet face, miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing\ncould undo, he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her\ndovelike purity, and was appalled at what he had done.",
      "Take them, take these dreadful books!",
      "she said, pushing away the\nnotebooks lying before her on the table.",
      "Why did you give them me?",
      "No,\nit was better anyway,  she added, touched by his despairing face.",
      "But\nit s awful, awful!",
      "His head sank, and he was silent.",
      "He could say nothing.",
      "You can t forgive me,  he whispered.",
      "Yes, I forgive you; but it s terrible!",
      "But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter\nit, it only added another shade to it.",
      "She forgave him; but from that\ntime more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her, morally\nbowed down lower than ever before her, and prized more highly than ever\nhis undeserved happiness.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nUnconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken\nplace during and after dinner, Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his\nsolitary room.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna s words about forgiveness had aroused\nin him nothing but annoyance.",
      "The applicability or non-applicability of\nthe Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to\nbe discussed lightly, and this question had long ago been answered by\nAlexey Alexandrovitch in the negative.",
      "Of all that had been said, what\nstuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid, good-natured\nTurovtsin _Acted like a man, he did!",
      "Called him out and shot him!_ \nEveryone had apparently shared this feeling, though from politeness\nthey had not expressed it.",
      "But the matter is settled, it s useless thinking about it,  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch told himself.",
      "And thinking of nothing but the journey\nbefore him, and the revision work he had to do, he went into his room\nand asked the porter who escorted him where his man was.",
      "The porter\nsaid that the man had only just gone out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered\ntea to be sent him, sat down to the table, and taking the guidebook,\nbegan considering the route of his journey.",
      "Two telegrams,  said his manservant, coming into the room.",
      "I beg your\npardon, your excellency; I d only just that minute gone out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them.",
      "The first\ntelegram was the announcement of Stremov s appointment to the very post\nKarenin had coveted.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down, and\nflushing a little, got up and began to pace up and down the room.",
      "_Quos vult perdere dementat_,  he said, meaning by _quos_ the persons\nresponsible for this appointment.",
      "He was not so much annoyed that he\nhad not received the post, that he had been conspicuously passed over;\nbut it was incomprehensible, amazing to him that they did not see that\nthe wordy phrase-monger Stremov was the last man fit for it.",
      "How could\nthey fail to see how they were ruining themselves, lowering their\n_prestige_ by this appointment?",
      "Something else in the same line,  he said to himself bitterly, opening\nthe second telegram.",
      "The telegram was from his wife.",
      "Her name, written\nin blue pencil,  Anna,  was the first thing that caught his eye.",
      "I am\ndying; I beg, I implore you to come.",
      "I shall die easier with your\nforgiveness,  he read.",
      "He smiled contemptuously, and flung down the\ntelegram.",
      "That this was a trick and a fraud, of that, he thought for\nthe first minute, there could be no doubt.",
      "There is no deceit she would stick at.",
      "She was near her confinement.",
      "Perhaps it is the confinement.",
      "But what can be their aim?",
      "To legitimize\nthe child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,  he thought.",
      "But\nsomething was said in it: I am dying....",
      "He read the telegram again,\nand suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him.",
      "And if it is true?",
      "he said to himself.",
      "If it is true that in the\nmoment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent, and I,\ntaking it for a trick, refuse to go?",
      "That would not only be cruel, and\neveryone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.",
      "Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,  he said to his\nservant.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see\nhis wife.",
      "If her illness was a trick, he would say nothing and go away\nagain.",
      "If she was really in danger, and wished to see him before her\ndeath, he would forgive her if he found her alive, and pay her the last\nduties if he came too late.",
      "All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do.",
      "With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the\ntrain, in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove\nthrough the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him, not\nthinking of what was awaiting him.",
      "He could not think about it, because\nin picturing what would happen, he could not drive away the reflection\nthat her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position.",
      "Bakers, closed shops, night-cabmen, porters sweeping the pavements\nflashed past his eyes, and he watched it all, trying to smother the\nthought of what was awaiting him, and what he dared not hope for, and\nyet was hoping for.",
      "He drove up to the steps.",
      "A sledge and a carriage\nwith the coachman asleep stood at the entrance.",
      "As he went into the\nentry, Alexey Alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from\nthe remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly.",
      "Its\nmeaning ran:  If it s a trick, then calm contempt and departure.",
      "If\ntruth, do what is proper.",
      "The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang.",
      "The\nporter, Kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in\nslippers.",
      "How is your mistress?",
      "A successful confinement yesterday.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white.",
      "He felt\ndistinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death.",
      "And how is she?",
      "Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs.",
      "Very ill,  he answered.",
      "There was a consultation yesterday, and the\ndoctor s here now.",
      "Take my things,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, and feeling some relief\nat the news that there was still hope of her death, he went into the\nhall.",
      "On the hatstand there was a military overcoat.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch\nnoticed it and asked:\n\n Who is here?",
      "The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms.",
      "In the drawing-room there was no one; at the sound of his steps there\ncame out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons.",
      "She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and with the familiarity given by\nthe approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the\nbedroom.",
      "Thank God you ve come!",
      "She keeps on about you and nothing but you, \nshe said.",
      "Make haste with the ice!",
      "the doctor s peremptory voice said from the\nbedroom.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir.",
      "At the table, sitting sideways in a low chair, was Vronsky, his face\nhidden in his hands, weeping.",
      "He jumped up at the doctor s voice, took\nhis hands from his face, and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Seeing the\nhusband, he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again, drawing his head\ndown to his shoulders, as if he wanted to disappear; but he made an\neffort over himself, got up and said:\n\n She is dying.",
      "The doctors say there is no hope.",
      "I am entirely in your\npower, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal.",
      "I.... \n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, seeing Vronsky s tears, felt a rush of that\nnervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people s\nsuffering, and turning away his face, he moved hurriedly to the door,\nwithout hearing the rest of his words.",
      "From the bedroom came the sound\nof Anna s voice saying something.",
      "Her voice was lively, eager, with\nexceedingly distinct intonations.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the\nbedroom, and went up to the bed.",
      "She was lying turned with her face\ntowards him.",
      "Her cheeks were flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her\nlittle white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown\nwere playing with the quilt, twisting it about.",
      "It seemed as though she\nwere not only well and blooming, but in the happiest frame of mind.",
      "She\nwas talking rapidly, musically, and with exceptionally correct\narticulation and expressive intonation.",
      "For Alexey I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a strange and\nawful thing that both are Alexey, isn t it?)",
      "Alexey would not refuse\nme.",
      "I should forget, he would forgive....",
      "But why doesn t he come?",
      "He s\nso good he doesn t know himself how good he is.",
      "Ah, my God, what agony!",
      "Give me some water, quick!",
      "Oh, that will be bad for her, my little\ngirl!",
      "Oh, very well then, give her to a nurse.",
      "Yes, I agree, it s\nbetter in fact.",
      "He ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her.",
      "Give her\nto the nurse.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna, he has come.",
      "Here he is!",
      "said the midwife, trying to\nattract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Oh, what nonsense!",
      "Anna went on, not seeing her husband.",
      "No, give\nher to me; give me my little one!",
      "He has not come yet.",
      "You say he won t\nforgive me, because you don t know him.",
      "No one knows him.",
      "I m the only\none, and it was hard for me even.",
      "His eyes I ought to know Seryozha has\njust the same eyes and I can t bear to see them because of it.",
      "Has\nSeryozha had his dinner?",
      "I know everyone will forget him.",
      "He would not\nforget.",
      "Seryozha must be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must\nbe asked to sleep with him.",
      "All of a sudden she shrank back, was silent; and in terror, as though\nexpecting a blow, as though to defend herself, she raised her hands to\nher face.",
      "She had seen her husband.",
      "No, no!",
      "she began.",
      "I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of death.",
      "Alexey, come here.",
      "I am in a hurry, because I ve no time, I ve not long\nleft to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand\nnothing more.",
      "Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony; he\ntook her by the hand and tried to say something, but he could not utter\nit; his lower lip quivered, but he still went on struggling with his\nemotion, and only now and then glanced at her.",
      "And each time he glanced\nat her, he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and\ntriumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them.",
      "Wait a minute, you don t know ... stay a little, stay!...",
      "She\nstopped, as though collecting her ideas.",
      "Yes,  she began;  yes, yes,\nyes.",
      "This is what I wanted to say.",
      "Don t be surprised at me.",
      "I m still\nthe same....",
      "But there is another woman in me, I m afraid of her: she\nloved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her\nthat used to be.",
      "I m not that woman.",
      "Now I m my real self, all myself.",
      "I m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him.",
      "Even now I feel see here,\nthe weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers.",
      "My fingers see how\nhuge they are!",
      "But this will soon all be over.... Only one thing I\nwant: forgive me, forgive me quite.",
      "I m terrible, but my nurse used to\ntell me; the holy martyr what was her name?",
      "She was worse.",
      "And I ll go\nto Rome; there s a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to\nanyone, only I ll take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can t\nforgive me!",
      "I know, it can t be forgiven!",
      "No, no, go away, you re too\ngood!",
      "She held his hand in one burning hand, while she pushed him away\nwith the other.",
      "The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing, and had\nby now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it.",
      "He\nsuddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the\ncontrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new\nhappiness he had never known.",
      "He did not think that the Christian law\nthat he had been all his life trying to follow, enjoined on him to\nforgive and love his enemies; but a glad feeling of love and\nforgiveness for his enemies filled his heart.",
      "He knelt down, and laying\nhis head in the curve of her arm, which burned him as with fire through\nthe sleeve, he sobbed like a little child.",
      "She put her arm around his\nhead, moved towards him, and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes.",
      "That is he.",
      "I knew him!",
      "Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...",
      "They ve come again; why don t they go away?...",
      "Oh, take these cloaks\noff me!",
      "The doctor unloosed her hands, carefully laying her on the pillow, and\ncovered her up to the shoulders.",
      "She lay back submissively, and looked\nbefore her with beaming eyes.",
      "Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want\nnothing more.... Why doesn t _he_ come?",
      "she said, turning to the door\ntowards Vronsky.",
      "Do come, do come!",
      "Give him your hand.",
      "Vronsky came to the side of the bed, and seeing Anna, again hid his\nface in his hands.",
      "Uncover your face look at him!",
      "He s a saint,  she said.",
      "Oh!",
      "uncover\nyour face, do uncover it!",
      "she said angrily.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, do\nuncover his face!",
      "I want to see him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky s hands and drew them away from his\nface, which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it.",
      "Give him your hand.",
      "Forgive him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, not attempting to restrain the\ntears that streamed from his eyes.",
      "Thank God, thank God!",
      "she said,  now everything is ready.",
      "Only to\nstretch my legs a little.",
      "There, that s capital.",
      "How badly these\nflowers are done not a bit like a violet,  she said, pointing to the\nhangings.",
      "My God, my God!",
      "when will it end?",
      "Give me some morphine.",
      "Doctor, give me some morphine!",
      "Oh, my God, my God!",
      "And she tossed about on the bed.",
      "The doctors said that it was puerperal fever, and that it was\nninety-nine chances in a hundred it would end in death.",
      "The whole day\nlong there was fever, delirium, and unconsciousness.",
      "At midnight the\npatient lay without consciousness, and almost without pulse.",
      "The end was expected every minute.",
      "Vronsky had gone home, but in the morning he came to inquire, and\nAlexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall, said:  Better stay, she\nmight ask for you,  and himself led him to his wife s boudoir.",
      "Towards\nmorning, there was a return again of excitement, rapid thought and\ntalk, and again it ended in unconsciousness.",
      "On the third day it was\nthe same thing, and the doctors said there was hope.",
      "That day Alexey\nAlexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting, and\nclosing the door sat down opposite him.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch,  said Vronsky, feeling that a statement of the\nposition was coming,  I can t speak, I can t understand.",
      "Spare me!",
      "However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.",
      "He would have risen; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and\nsaid:\n\n I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary.",
      "I must explain my feelings,\nthe feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not\nbe in error regarding me.",
      "You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had\neven begun to take proceedings.",
      "I won t conceal from you that in\nbeginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess\nthat I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her.",
      "When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say\nmore, I longed for her death.",
      "But....",
      "He paused, pondering whether to\ndisclose or not to disclose his feeling to him.",
      "But I saw her and\nforgave her.",
      "And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my\nduty.",
      "I forgive completely.",
      "I would offer the other cheek, I would give\nmy cloak if my coat be taken.",
      "I pray to God only not to take from me\nthe bliss of forgiveness!",
      "Tears stood in his eyes, and the luminous, serene look in them\nimpressed Vronsky.",
      "This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the\nlaughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never\nutter a word of reproach to you,  Alexey Alexandrovitch went on.",
      "My\nduty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I will be.",
      "If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it\nwould be better for you to go away.",
      "He got up, and sobs cut short his words.",
      "Vronsky too was getting up,\nand in a stooping, not yet erect posture, looked up at him from under\nhis brows.",
      "He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch s feeling, but\nhe felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with\nhis view of life.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nAfter the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch, Vronsky went out\nonto the steps of the Karenins  house and stood still, with difficulty\nremembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive.",
      "He felt\ndisgraced, humiliated, guilty, and deprived of all possibility of\nwashing away his humiliation.",
      "He felt thrust out of the beaten track\nalong which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then.",
      "All the\nhabits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm, had turned out\nsuddenly false and inapplicable.",
      "The betrayed husband, who had figured\ntill that time as a pitiful creature, an incidental and somewhat\nludicrous obstacle to his happiness, had suddenly been summoned by her\nherself, elevated to an awe-inspiring pinnacle, and on the pinnacle\nthat husband had shown himself, not malignant, not false, not\nludicrous, but kind and straightforward and large.",
      "Vronsky could not\nbut feel this, and the parts were suddenly reversed.",
      "Vronsky felt his\nelevation and his own abasement, his truth and his own falsehood.",
      "He\nfelt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow, while he had\nbeen base and petty in his deceit.",
      "But this sense of his own\nhumiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a\nsmall part of his misery.",
      "He felt unutterably wretched now, for his\npassion for Anna, which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler,\nnow that he knew he had lost her forever, was stronger than ever it had\nbeen.",
      "He had seen all of her in her illness, had come to know her very\nsoul, and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then.",
      "And\nnow when he had learned to know her, to love her as she should be\nloved, he had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever,\nleaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory.",
      "Most\nterrible of all had been his ludicrous, shameful position when Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face.",
      "He\nstood on the steps of the Karenins  house like one distraught, and did\nnot know what to do.",
      "A sledge, sir?",
      "asked the porter.",
      "Yes, a sledge.",
      "On getting home, after three sleepless nights, Vronsky, without\nundressing, lay down flat on the sofa, clasping his hands and laying\nhis head on them.",
      "His head was heavy.",
      "Images, memories, and ideas of\nthe strangest description followed one another with extraordinary\nrapidity and vividness.",
      "First it was the medicine he had poured out for\nthe patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife s white hands,\nthen the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the\nbed.",
      "To sleep!",
      "To forget!",
      "he said to himself with the serene confidence of\na healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy, he will go to sleep at\nonce.",
      "And the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he\nbegan to drop off into forgetfulness.",
      "The waves of the sea of\nunconsciousness had begun to meet over his head, when all at once it\nwas as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him.",
      "He\nstarted so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa, and leaning on\nhis arms got in a panic onto his knees.",
      "His eyes were wide open as\nthough he had never been asleep.",
      "The heaviness in his head and the\nweariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly\ngone.",
      "You may trample me in the mud,  he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch s words\nand saw him standing before him, and saw Anna s face with its burning\nflush and glittering eyes, gazing with love and tenderness not at him\nbut at Alexey Alexandrovitch; he saw his own, as he fancied, foolish\nand ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away\nfrom his face.",
      "He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the\nsofa in the same position and shut his eyes.",
      "To sleep!",
      "To forget!",
      "he repeated to himself.",
      "But with his eyes shut\nhe saw more distinctly than ever Anna s face as it had been on the\nmemorable evening before the races.",
      "That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her\nmemory.",
      "But I cannot live without it.",
      "How can we be reconciled?",
      "how can\nwe be reconciled?",
      "he said aloud, and unconsciously began to repeat\nthese words.",
      "This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and\nmemories, which he felt were thronging in his brain.",
      "But repeating\nwords did not check his imagination for long.",
      "Again in extraordinarily\nrapid succession his best moments rose before his mind, and then his\nrecent humiliation.",
      "Take away his hands,  Anna s voice says.",
      "He takes\naway his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his\nface.",
      "He still lay down, trying to sleep, though he felt there was not the\nsmallest hope of it, and kept repeating stray words from some chain of\nthought, trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images.",
      "He\nlistened, and heard in a strange, mad whisper words repeated:  I did\nnot appreciate it, did not make enough of it.",
      "I did not appreciate it,\ndid not make enough of it.",
      "What s this?",
      "Am I going out of my mind?",
      "he said to himself.",
      "Perhaps.",
      "What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?",
      "he answered himself, and opening his eyes, he saw with wonder an\nembroidered cushion beside him, worked by Varya, his brother s wife.",
      "He\ntouched the tassel of the cushion, and tried to think of Varya, of when\nhe had seen her last.",
      "But to think of anything extraneous was an\nagonizing effort.",
      "No, I must sleep!",
      "He moved the cushion up, and\npressed his head into it, but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes\nshut.",
      "He jumped up and sat down.",
      "That s all over for me,  he said to\nhimself.",
      "I must think what to do.",
      "What is left?",
      "His mind rapidly ran\nthrough his life apart from his love of Anna.",
      "Ambition?",
      "Serpuhovskoy?",
      "Society?",
      "The court?",
      "He could not come to a\npause anywhere.",
      "All of it had had meaning before, but now there was no\nreality in it.",
      "He got up from the sofa, took off his coat, undid his\nbelt, and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely, walked up\nand down the room.",
      "This is how people go mad,  he repeated,  and how\nthey shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation,  he added slowly.",
      "He went to the door and closed it, then with fixed eyes and clenched\nteeth he went up to the table, took a revolver, looked round him,\nturned it to a loaded barrel, and sank into thought.",
      "For two minutes,\nhis head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of\nthought, he stood with the revolver in his hand, motionless, thinking.",
      "Of course,  he said to himself, as though a logical, continuous, and\nclear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion.",
      "In reality this  of course,  that seemed convincing to him, was simply\nthe result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through\nwhich he had passed ten times already during the last hour memories of\nhappiness lost forever.",
      "There was the same conception of the\nsenselessness of everything to come in life, the same consciousness of\nhumiliation.",
      "Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the\nsame.",
      "Of course,  he repeated, when for the third time his thought passed\nagain round the same spellbound circle of memories and images, and\npulling the revolver to the left side of his chest, and clutching it\nvigorously with his whole hand, as it were, squeezing it in his fist,\nhe pulled the trigger.",
      "He did not hear the sound of the shot, but a\nviolent blow on his chest sent him reeling.",
      "He tried to clutch at the\nedge of the table, dropped the revolver, staggered, and sat down on the\nground, looking about him in astonishment.",
      "He did not recognize his\nroom, looking up from the ground, at the bent legs of the table, at the\nwastepaper basket, and the tiger-skin rug.",
      "The hurried, creaking steps\nof his servant coming through the drawing-room brought him to his\nsenses.",
      "He made an effort at thought, and was aware that he was on the\nfloor; and seeing blood on the tiger-skin rug and on his arm, he knew\nhe had shot himself.",
      "Idiotic!",
      "Missed!",
      "he said, fumbling after the revolver.",
      "The revolver\nwas close beside him he sought further off.",
      "Still feeling for it, he\nstretched out to the other side, and not being strong enough to keep\nhis balance, fell over, streaming with blood.",
      "The elegant, whiskered manservant, who used to be continually\ncomplaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves, was so\npanic-stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor, that he left\nhim losing blood while he ran for assistance.",
      "An hour later Varya, his\nbrother s wife, had arrived, and with the assistance of three doctors,\nwhom she had sent for in all directions, and who all appeared at the\nsame moment, she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nThe mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that, when preparing for\nseeing his wife, he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance\nmight be sincere, and he might forgive her, and she might not die this\nmistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him\nin all its significance.",
      "But the mistake made by him had arisen not\nsimply from his having overlooked that contingency, but also from the\nfact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife, he had\nnot known his own heart.",
      "At his sick wife s bedside he had for the\nfirst time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic\nsuffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others, and\nhitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness.",
      "And pity\nfor her, and remorse for having desired her death, and most of all, the\njoy of forgiveness, made him at once conscious, not simply of the\nrelief of his own sufferings, but of a spiritual peace he had never\nexperienced before.",
      "He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the\nsource of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy;\nthat what had seemed insoluble while he was judging, blaming, and\nhating, had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved.",
      "He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse.",
      "He forgave Vronsky, and pitied him, especially after reports reached\nhim of his despairing action.",
      "He felt more for his son than before.",
      "And\nhe blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him.",
      "But\nfor the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of\npity, only, but of tenderness.",
      "At first, from a feeling of compassion\nalone, he had been interested in the delicate little creature, who was\nnot his child, and who was cast on one side during her mother s\nillness, and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about\nher, and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her.",
      "He would\ngo into the nursery several times a day, and sit there for a long\nwhile, so that the nurses, who were at first afraid of him, got quite\nused to his presence.",
      "Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would\nsit silently gazing at the saffron-red, downy, wrinkled face of the\nsleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the\nfat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes\nand nose.",
      "At such moments particularly, Alexey Alexandrovitch had a\nsense of perfect peace and inward harmony, and saw nothing\nextraordinary in his position, nothing that ought to be changed.",
      "But as time went on, he saw more and more distinctly that however\nnatural the position now seemed to him, he would not long be allowed to\nremain in it.",
      "He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force\ncontrolling his soul, there was another, a brutal force, as powerful,\nor more powerful, which controlled his life, and that this force would\nnot allow him that humble peace he longed for.",
      "He felt that everyone\nwas looking at him with inquiring wonder, that he was not understood,\nand that something was expected of him.",
      "Above all, he felt the\ninstability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife.",
      "When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed\naway, Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of\nhim, ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face.",
      "She seemed to be wanting, and not daring, to tell him something; and as\nthough foreseeing their present relations could not continue, she\nseemed to be expecting something from him.",
      "Towards the end of February it happened that Anna s baby daughter, who\nhad been named Anna too, fell ill. Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the\nnursery in the morning, and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent\nfor, he went to his office.",
      "On finishing his work, he returned home at\nfour.",
      "Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery\nand a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak.",
      "Who is here?",
      "asked Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,  the groom answered, and it\nseemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned.",
      "During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that\nhis worldly acquaintances, especially women, took a peculiar interest\nin him and his wife.",
      "All these acquaintances he observed with\ndifficulty concealing their mirth at something; the same mirth that he\nhad perceived in the lawyer s eyes, and just now in the eyes of this\ngroom.",
      "Everyone seemed, somehow, hugely delighted, as though they had\njust been at a wedding.",
      "When they met him, with ill-disguised enjoyment\nthey inquired after his wife s health.",
      "The presence of Princess\nTverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories\nassociated with her, and also because he disliked her, and he went\nstraight to the nursery.",
      "In the day nursery Seryozha, leaning on the\ntable with his legs on a chair, was drawing and chatting away merrily.",
      "The English governess, who had during Anna s illness replaced the\nFrench one, was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl.",
      "She hurriedly\ngot up, curtseyed, and pulled Seryozha.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son s hair, answered the governess s\ninquiries about his wife, and asked what the doctor had said of the\nbaby.",
      "The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.",
      "But she is still in pain,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, listening to\nthe baby s screaming in the next room.",
      "I think it s the wet-nurse, sir,  the Englishwoman said firmly.",
      "What makes you think so?",
      "he asked, stopping short.",
      "It s just as it was at Countess Paul s, sir.",
      "They gave the baby\nmedicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse\nhad no milk, sir.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, and after standing still a few seconds\nhe went in at the other door.",
      "The baby was lying with its head thrown\nback, stiffening itself in the nurse s arms, and would not take the\nplump breast offered it; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the\ndouble hushing of the wet-nurse and the other nurse, who was bending\nover her.",
      "Still no better?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "She s very restless,  answered the nurse in a whisper.",
      "Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,  he said.",
      "I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Then why didn t you say so?",
      "Who s one to say it to?",
      "Anna Arkadyevna still ill....  said the nurse\ndiscontentedly.",
      "The nurse was an old servant of the family.",
      "And in her simple words\nthere seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position.",
      "The baby screamed louder than ever, struggling and sobbing.",
      "The nurse,\nwith a gesture of despair, went to it, took it from the wet-nurse s\narms, and began walking up and down, rocking it.",
      "You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "The smartly dressed and healthy-looking nurse,\nfrightened at the idea of losing her place, muttered something to\nherself, and covering her bosom, smiled contemptuously at the idea of\ndoubts being cast on her abundance of milk.",
      "In that smile, too, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position.",
      "Luckless child!",
      "said the nurse, hushing the baby, and still walking\nup and down with it.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down, and with a despondent and suffering\nface watched the nurse walking to and fro.",
      "When the child at last was still, and had been put in a deep bed, and\nthe nurse, after smoothing the little pillow, had left her, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch got up, and walking awkwardly on tiptoe, approached the\nbaby.",
      "For a minute he was still, and with the same despondent face\ngazed at the baby; but all at once a smile, that moved his hair and the\nskin of his forehead, came out on his face, and he went as softly out\nof the room.",
      "In the dining-room he rang the bell, and told the servant who came in\nto send again for the doctor.",
      "He felt vexed with his wife for not being\nanxious about this exquisite baby, and in this vexed humor he had no\nwish to go to her; he had no wish, either, to see Princess Betsy.",
      "But\nhis wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual; and so,\novercoming his disinclination, he went towards the bedroom.",
      "As he\nwalked over the soft rug towards the door, he could not help\noverhearing a conversation he did not want to hear.",
      "If he hadn t been going away, I could have understood your answer and\nhis too.",
      "But your husband ought to be above that,  Betsy was saying.",
      "It s not for my husband; for myself I don t wish it.",
      "Don t say that!",
      "answered Anna s excited voice.",
      "Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself\non your account.... \n\n That s just why I don t want to.",
      "With a dismayed and guilty expression, Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped\nand would have gone back unobserved.",
      "But reflecting that this would be\nundignified, he turned back again, and clearing his throat, he went up\nto the bedroom.",
      "The voices were silent, and he went in.",
      "Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black\ncurls on her round head, was sitting on a settee.",
      "The eagerness died\nout of her face, as it always did, at the sight of her husband; she\ndropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy.",
      "Betsy, dressed in\nthe height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over\nher head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway\nstripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt,\nwas sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect.",
      "Bowing her\nhead, she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile.",
      "Ah!",
      "she said, as though surprised.",
      "I m very glad you re at home.",
      "You\nnever put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven t seen you ever since\nAnna has been ill.",
      "I have heard all about it your anxiety.",
      "Yes, you re\na wonderful husband!",
      "she said, with a meaning and affable air, as\nthough she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his\nconduct to his wife.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly, and kissing his wife s hand,\nasked how she was.",
      "Better, I think,  she said, avoiding his eyes.",
      "But you ve rather a feverish-looking color,  he said, laying stress on\nthe word  feverish.",
      "We ve been talking too much,  said Betsy.",
      "I feel it s selfishness on\nmy part, and I am going away.",
      "She got up, but Anna, suddenly flushing, quickly caught at her hand.",
      "No, wait a minute, please.",
      "I must tell you ... no, you.",
      "she turned to\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, and her neck and brow were suffused with\ncrimson.",
      "I won t and can t keep anything secret from you,  she said.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head.",
      "Betsy s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say\ngood-bye before his departure for Tashkend.",
      "She did not look at her\nhusband, and was evidently in haste to have everything out, however\nhard it might be for her.",
      "I told her I could not receive him.",
      "You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch, \nBetsy corrected her.",
      "Oh, no, I can t receive him; and what object would there....  She\nstopped suddenly, and glanced inquiringly at her husband (he did not\nlook at her).",
      "In short, I don t wish it.... \n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand.",
      "Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big\nswollen veins that sought hers, but with an obvious effort to control\nherself she pressed his hand.",
      "I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but....  he said,\nfeeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily\nand clearly by himself, he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya,\nwho to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would\ninevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world, and\nhinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness.",
      "He\nstopped short, looking at Princess Tverskaya.",
      "Well, good-bye, my darling,  said Betsy, getting up.",
      "She kissed Anna,\nand went out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "I know you are a truly magnanimous man,  said\nBetsy, stopping in the little drawing-room, and with special warmth\nshaking hands with him once more.",
      "I am an outsider, but I so love her\nand respect you that I venture to advise.",
      "Receive him.",
      "Alexey Vronsky\nis the soul of honor, and he is going away to Tashkend.",
      "Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice.",
      "But the question of\nwhether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.",
      "He said this from habit, lifting his brows with dignity, and reflected\nimmediately that whatever his words might be, there could be no dignity\nin his position.",
      "And he saw this by the suppressed, malicious, and\nironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing-room, and went\nto his wife.",
      "She was lying down, but hearing his steps she sat up\nhastily in her former attitude, and looked in a scared way at him.",
      "He\nsaw she had been crying.",
      "I am very grateful for your confidence in me.",
      "He repeated gently in\nRussian the phrase he had said in Betsy s presence in French, and sat\ndown beside her.",
      "When he spoke to her in Russian, using the Russian\n thou  of intimacy and affection, it was insufferably irritating to\nAnna.",
      "And I am very grateful for your decision.",
      "I, too, imagine that\nsince he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky\nto come here.",
      "However, if....",
      "But I ve said so already, so why repeat it?",
      "Anna suddenly interrupted\nhim with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing.",
      "No sort of\nnecessity,  she thought,  for a man to come and say good-bye to the\nwoman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined\nhimself, and who cannot live without him.",
      "No sort of necessity!",
      "she\ncompressed her lips, and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with\ntheir swollen veins.",
      "They were rubbing each other.",
      "Let us never speak of it,  she added more calmly.",
      "I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to\nsee....  Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning.",
      "That my wish coincides with your own,  she finished quickly,\nexasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he\nwould say.",
      "Yes,  he assented;  and Princess Tverskaya s interference in the most\ndifficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for.",
      "She especially....",
      "I don t believe a word of what s said about her,  said Anna quickly.",
      "I know she really cares for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing.",
      "She played nervously\nwith the tassel of her dressing-gown, glancing at him with that\ntorturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself,\nthough she could not control it.",
      "Her only desire now was to be rid of\nhis oppressive presence.",
      "I have just sent for the doctor,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?",
      "No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn t enough milk.",
      "Why didn t you let me nurse her, when I begged to?",
      "Anyway  (Alexey\nAlexandrovitch knew what was meant by that  anyway ),  she s a baby,\nand they re killing her.",
      "She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be\nbrought her.",
      "I begged to nurse her, I wasn t allowed to, and now I m\nblamed for it.",
      "I don t blame....",
      "Yes, you do blame me!",
      "My God!",
      "why didn t I die!",
      "And she broke into\nsobs.",
      "Forgive me, I m nervous, I m unjust,  she said, controlling\nherself,  but do go away.... \n\n No, it can t go on like this,  Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself\ndecidedly as he left his wife s room.",
      "Never had the impossibility of his position in the world s eyes, and\nhis wife s hatred of him, and altogether the might of that mysterious\nbrutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations,\nand exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to\nhis wife, been presented to him with such distinctness as that day.",
      "He\nsaw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something,\nbut what exactly, he could not make out.",
      "He felt that this was rousing\nin his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of\nall the good of his achievement.",
      "He believed that for Anna herself it\nwould be better to break off all relations with Vronsky; but if they\nall thought this out of the question, he was even ready to allow these\nrelations to be renewed, so long as the children were not disgraced,\nand he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position.",
      "Bad\nas this might be, it was anyway better than a rupture, which would put\nher in a hopeless and shameful position, and deprive him of everything\nhe cared for.",
      "But he felt helpless; he knew beforehand that everyone\nwas against him, and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to\nhim now so natural and right, but would be forced to do what was wrong,\nthough it seemed the proper thing to them.",
      "Chapter 21\n\nBefore Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing-room, she was met in\nthe doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just come from Yeliseev s,\nwhere a consignment of fresh oysters had been received.",
      "Ah!",
      "princess!",
      "what a delightful meeting!",
      "he began.",
      "I ve been to see\nyou.",
      "A meeting for one minute, for I m going,  said Betsy, smiling and\nputting on her glove.",
      "Don t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand.",
      "There s\nnothing I m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the\nkissing the hand.",
      "He kissed Betsy s hand.",
      "When shall we see each\nother?",
      "You don t deserve it,  answered Betsy, smiling.",
      "Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I ve become a most serious\nperson.",
      "I don t only manage my own affairs, but other people s too,  he\nsaid, with a significant expression.",
      "Oh, I m so glad!",
      "answered Betsy, at once understanding that he was\nspeaking of Anna.",
      "And going back into the drawing-room, they stood in a\ncorner.",
      "He s killing her,  said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning.",
      "It s impossible, impossible....",
      "I m so glad you think so,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, shaking his head\nwith a serious and sympathetically distressed expression,  that s what\nI ve come to Petersburg for.",
      "The whole town s talking of it,  she said.",
      "It s an impossible\nposition.",
      "She pines and pines away.",
      "He doesn t understand that she s\none of those women who can t trifle with their feelings.",
      "One of two\nthings: either let him take her away, act with energy, or give her a\ndivorce.",
      "This is stifling her.",
      "Yes, yes ... just so....  Oblonsky said, sighing.",
      "That s what I ve\ncome for.",
      "At least not solely for that ...",
      "I ve been made a\n_Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you.",
      "But the chief thing\nwas having to settle this.",
      "Well, God help you!",
      "said Betsy.",
      "After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall, once more kissing her\nhand above the glove, at the point where the pulse beats, and murmuring\nto her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or\nbe angry, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister.",
      "He found her in\ntears.",
      "Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits, Stepan\nArkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic,\npoetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood.",
      "He asked her\nhow she was, and how she had spent the morning.",
      "Very, very miserably.",
      "Today and this morning and all past days and\ndays to come,  she said.",
      "I think you re giving way to pessimism.",
      "You must rouse yourself, you\nmust look life in the face.",
      "I know it s hard, but....",
      "I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices,  Anna\nbegan suddenly,  but I hate him for his virtues.",
      "I can t live with him.",
      "Do you understand?",
      "the sight of him has a physical effect on me, it\nmakes me beside myself.",
      "I can t, I can t live with him.",
      "What am I to\ndo?",
      "I have been unhappy, and used to think one couldn t be more\nunhappy, but the awful state of things I am going through now, I could\nnever have conceived.",
      "Would you believe it, that knowing he s a good\nman, a splendid man, that I m not worth his little finger, still I hate\nhim.",
      "I hate him for his generosity.",
      "And there s nothing left for me\nbut.... \n\nShe would have said death, but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her\nfinish.",
      "You are ill and overwrought,  he said;  believe me, you re\nexaggerating dreadfully.",
      "There s nothing so terrible in it.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled.",
      "No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch s\nplace, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile\n(the smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so\nmuch of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not\nwound, but softened and soothed.",
      "His gentle, soothing words and smiles\nwere as soothing and softening as almond oil.",
      "And Anna soon felt this.",
      "No, Stiva,  she said,  I m lost, lost!",
      "worse than lost!",
      "I can t say\nyet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it s not over.",
      "I m\nan overstrained string that must snap.",
      "But it s not ended yet ... and\nit will have a fearful end.",
      "No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.",
      "There s no position from which there is no way of escape.",
      "I have thought, and thought.",
      "Only one.... \n\nAgain he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in\nher thought was death, and he would not let her say it.",
      "Not at all,  he said.",
      "Listen to me.",
      "You can t see your own position\nas I can.",
      "Let me tell you candidly my opinion.",
      "Again he smiled\ndiscreetly his almond-oil smile.",
      "I ll begin from the beginning.",
      "You\nmarried a man twenty years older than yourself.",
      "You married him without\nlove and not knowing what love was.",
      "It was a mistake, let s admit.",
      "A fearful mistake!",
      "said Anna.",
      "But I repeat, it s an accomplished fact.",
      "Then you had, let us say, the\nmisfortune to love a man not your husband.",
      "That was a misfortune; but\nthat, too, is an accomplished fact.",
      "And your husband knew it and\nforgave it.",
      "He stopped at each sentence, waiting for her to object,\nbut she made no answer.",
      "That s so.",
      "Now the question is: can you go on\nliving with your husband?",
      "Do you wish it?",
      "Does he wish it?",
      "I know nothing, nothing.",
      "But you said yourself that you can t endure him.",
      "No, I didn t say so.",
      "I deny it.",
      "I can t tell, I don t know anything\nabout it.",
      "Yes, but let.... \n\n You can t understand.",
      "I feel I m lying head downwards in a sort of\npit, but I ought not to save myself.",
      "And I can t.... \n\n Never mind, we ll slip something under and pull you out.",
      "I understand\nyou: I understand that you can t take it on yourself to express your\nwishes, your feelings.",
      "There s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over.",
      "But he sees this and knows it.",
      "And do you suppose it weighs on him any\nless than on you?",
      "You re wretched, he s wretched, and what good can\ncome of it?",
      "while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.",
      "With\nsome effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea, and\nlooked significantly at her.",
      "She said nothing, and shook her cropped head in dissent.",
      "But from the\nlook in her face, that suddenly brightened into its old beauty, he saw\nthat if she did not desire this, it was simply because it seemed to her\nunattainable happiness.",
      "I m awfully sorry for you!",
      "And how happy I should be if I could\narrange things!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling more boldly.",
      "Don t\nspeak, don t say a word!",
      "God grant only that I may speak as I feel.",
      "I m\ngoing to him.",
      "Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes, and said nothing.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with the same somewhat solemn expression with\nwhich he used to take his presidential chair at his board, walked into\nAlexey Alexandrovitch s room.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about\nhis room with his hands behind his back, thinking of just what Stepan\nArkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife.",
      "I m not interrupting you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, on the sight of\nhis brother-in-law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment\nunusual with him.",
      "To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette\ncase he had just bought that opened in a new way, and sniffing the\nleather, took a cigarette out of it.",
      "No.",
      "Do you want anything?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without\neagerness.",
      "Yes, I wished ...",
      "I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to you,  said\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity.",
      "This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe\nit was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to\ndo was wrong.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that\nhad come over him.",
      "I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection\nand respect for you,  he said, reddening.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing, but his face struck\nStepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice.",
      "I intended ...",
      "I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister\nand your mutual position,  he said, still struggling with an\nunaccustomed constraint.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully, looked at his brother-in-law,\nand without answering went up to the table, took from it an unfinished\nletter, and handed it to his brother-in-law.",
      "I think unceasingly of the same thing.",
      "And here is what I had begun\nwriting, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence\nirritates her,  he said, as he gave him the letter.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter, looked with incredulous surprise\nat the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him, and began to read.",
      "I see that my presence is irksome to you.",
      "Painful as it is to me to\nbelieve it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise.",
      "I don t blame\nyou, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your\nillness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed\nbetween us and to begin a new life.",
      "I do not regret, and shall never\nregret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing your good, the\ngood of your soul and now I see I have not attained that.",
      "Tell me\nyourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul.",
      "I\nput myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what s\nright.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter, and with the same surprise\ncontinued looking at his brother-in-law, not knowing what to say.",
      "This\nsilence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch s lips\nbegan twitching nervously, while he still gazed without speaking at\nKarenin s face.",
      "That s what I wanted to say to her,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nturning away.",
      "Yes, yes....  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, not able to answer for the\ntears that were choking him.",
      "Yes, yes, I understand you,  he brought out at last.",
      "I want to know what she would like,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I am afraid she does not understand her own position.",
      "She is not a\njudge,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, recovering himself.",
      "She is crushed,\nsimply crushed by your generosity.",
      "If she were to read this letter, she\nwould be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang her head\nlower than ever.",
      "Yes, but what s to be done in that case?",
      "how explain, how find out her\nwishes?",
      "If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you\nto point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the\nposition.",
      "So you consider it must be ended?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted\nhim.",
      "But how?",
      "he added, with a gesture of his hands before his eyes\nnot usual with him.",
      "I see no possible way out of it.",
      "There is some way of getting out of every position,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, standing up and becoming more cheerful.",
      "There was a time\nwhen you thought of breaking off....",
      "If you are convinced now that you\ncannot make each other happy.... \n\n Happiness may be variously understood.",
      "But suppose that I agree to\neverything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of\nour position?",
      "If you care to know my opinion,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the\nsame smile of softening, almond-oil tenderness with which he had been\ntalking to Anna.",
      "His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by\nit, was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",
      "She will never speak out about it.",
      "But one thing is possible, one\nthing she might desire,  he went on,  that is the cessation of your\nrelations and all memories associated with them.",
      "To my thinking, in\nyour position what s essential is the formation of a new attitude to\none another.",
      "And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both\nsides.",
      "Divorce,  Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted, in a tone of aversion.",
      "Yes, I imagine that divorce yes, divorce,  Stepan Arkadyevitch\nrepeated, reddening.",
      "That is from every point of view the most\nrational course for married people who find themselves in the position\nyou are in.",
      "What can be done if married people find that life is\nimpossible for them together?",
      "That may always happen.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes.",
      "There s only one point to be considered: is either of the parties\ndesirous of forming new ties?",
      "If not, it is very simple,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, feeling more and more free from constraint.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, scowling with emotion, muttered something to\nhimself, and made no answer.",
      "All that seemed so simple to Stepan\nArkadyevitch, Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of\ntimes.",
      "And, so far from being simple, it all seemed to him utterly\nimpossible.",
      "Divorce, the details of which he knew by this time, seemed\nto him now out of the question, because the sense of his own dignity\nand respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious\ncharge of adultery, and still more suffering his wife, pardoned and\nbeloved by him, to be caught in the fact and put to public shame.",
      "Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty\ngrounds.",
      "What would become of his son in case of a divorce?",
      "To leave him with\nhis mother was out of the question.",
      "The divorced mother would have her\nown illegitimate family, in which his position as a stepson and his\neducation would not be good.",
      "Keep him with him?",
      "He knew that would be\nan act of vengeance on his part, and that he did not want.",
      "But apart\nfrom this, what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was, that by consenting to a divorce he would be\ncompletely ruining Anna.",
      "The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow,\nthat in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself, and not\nconsidering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably, had sunk\ninto his heart.",
      "And connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her,\nwith his devotion to the children, he understood it now in his own way.",
      "To consent to a divorce, to give her her freedom, meant in his thoughts\nto take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children\nwhom he loved; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on\nthe path of right, to thrust her down to her ruin.",
      "If she were\ndivorced, he knew she would join her life to Vronsky s, and their tie\nwould be an illegitimate and criminal one, since a wife, by the\ninterpretation of the ecclesiastical law, could not marry while her\nhusband was living.",
      "She will join him, and in a year or two he will\nthrow her over, or she will form a new tie,  thought Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to\nblame for her ruin.",
      "He had thought it all over hundreds of times, and\nwas convinced that a divorce was not at all simple, as Stepan\nArkadyevitch had said, but was utterly impossible.",
      "He did not believe a\nsingle word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him; to every word he had a\nthousand objections to make, but he listened to him, feeling that his\nwords were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled\nhis life and to which he would have to submit.",
      "The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.",
      "She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she\nleaves it all to your generosity.",
      "My God, my God!",
      "what for?",
      "thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, remembering\nthe details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame\non himself, and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done\nthe same, he hid his face for shame in his hands.",
      "You are distressed, I understand that.",
      "But if you think it over.... \n\n Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other\nalso; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also, \nthought Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "he cried in a shrill voice.",
      "I will take the disgrace on\nmyself, I will give up even my son, but ... but wouldn t it be better\nto let it alone?",
      "Still you may do as you like.... \n\nAnd turning away so that his brother-in-law could not see him, he sat\ndown on a chair at the window.",
      "There was bitterness, there was shame in\nhis heart, but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the\nheight of his own meekness.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched.",
      "He was silent for a space.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity, \nhe said.",
      "But it seems it was the will of God,  he added, and as he\nsaid it felt how foolish a remark it was, and with difficulty repressed\na smile at his own foolishness.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply, but tears stopped\nhim.",
      "This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such.",
      "I accept\nthe calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both\nher and you,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "When he went out of his brother-in-law s room he was touched, but that\ndid not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the\nmatter to a conclusion, for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would\nnot go back on his words.",
      "To this satisfaction was added the fact that\nan idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful\nachievement, that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and\nmost intimate friends.",
      "He put this riddle into two or three different\nways.",
      "But I ll work it out better than that,  he said to himself with\na smile.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nVronsky s wound had been a dangerous one, though it did not touch the\nheart, and for several days he had lain between life and death.",
      "The\nfirst time he was able to speak, Varya, his brother s wife, was alone\nin the room.",
      "Varya,  he said, looking sternly at her,  I shot myself by accident.",
      "And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so.",
      "Or else it s too\nridiculous.",
      "Without answering his words, Varya bent over him, and with a delighted\nsmile gazed into his face.",
      "His eyes were clear, not feverish; but their\nexpression was stern.",
      "Thank God!",
      "she said.",
      "You re not in pain?",
      "A little here.",
      "He pointed to his breast.",
      "Then let me change your bandages.",
      "In silence, stiffening his broad jaws, he looked at her while she\nbandaged him up.",
      "When she had finished he said:\n\n I m not delirious.",
      "Please manage that there may be no talk of my\nhaving shot myself on purpose.",
      "No one does say so.",
      "Only I hope you won t shoot yourself by accident\nany more,  she said, with a questioning smile.",
      "Of course I won t, but it would have been better.... \n\nAnd he smiled gloomily.",
      "In spite of these words and this smile, which so frightened Varya, when\nthe inflammation was over and he began to recover, he felt that he was\ncompletely free from one part of his misery.",
      "By his action he had, as\nit were, washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before.",
      "He\ncould now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "He recognized all his\nmagnanimity, but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it.",
      "Besides,\nhe got back again into the beaten track of his life.",
      "He saw the\npossibility of looking men in the face again without shame, and he\ncould live in accordance with his own habits.",
      "One thing he could not\npluck out of his heart, though he never ceased struggling with it, was\nthe regret, amounting to despair, that he had lost her forever.",
      "That\nnow, having expiated his sin against the husband, he was bound to\nrenounce her, and never in future to stand between her with her\nrepentance and her husband, he had firmly decided in his heart; but he\ncould not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love, he\ncould not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had\nso little prized at the time, and that haunted him in all their charm.",
      "Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend, and Vronsky\nagreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation.",
      "But the\nnearer the time of departure came, the bitterer was the sacrifice he\nwas making to what he thought his duty.",
      "His wound had healed, and he was driving about making preparations for\nhis departure for Tashkend.",
      "To see her once and then to bury myself, to die,  he thought, and as\nhe was paying farewell visits, he uttered this thought to Betsy.",
      "Charged with this commission, Betsy had gone to Anna, and brought him\nback a negative reply.",
      "So much the better,  thought Vronsky, when he received the news.",
      "It\nwas a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.",
      "Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning, and announced that\nshe had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce, and that therefore Vronsky\ncould see Anna.",
      "Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his flat, forgetting\nall his resolutions, without asking when he could see her, where her\nhusband was, Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins .",
      "He ran up the\nstairs seeing no one and nothing, and with a rapid step, almost\nbreaking into a run, he went into her room.",
      "And without considering,\nwithout noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not, he flung\nhis arms round her, and began to cover her face, her hands, her neck\nwith kisses.",
      "Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting, had thought what she\nwould say to him, but she did not succeed in saying anything of it; his\npassion mastered her.",
      "She tried to calm him, to calm herself, but it\nwas too late.",
      "His feeling infected her.",
      "Her lips trembled so that for a\nlong while she could say nothing.",
      "Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,  she said at last,\npressing his hands to her bosom.",
      "So it had to be,  he said.",
      "So long as we live, it must be so.",
      "I know\nit now.",
      "That s true,  she said, getting whiter and whiter, and embracing his\nhead.",
      "Still there is something terrible in it after all that has\nhappened.",
      "It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy.",
      "Our love, if\nit could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something\nterrible in it,  he said, lifting his head and parting his strong teeth\nin a smile.",
      "And she could not but respond with a smile not to his words, but to the\nlove in his eyes.",
      "She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and\ncropped head with it.",
      "I don t know you with this short hair.",
      "You ve grown so pretty.",
      "A boy.",
      "But how pale you are!",
      "Yes, I m very weak,  she said, smiling.",
      "And her lips began trembling\nagain.",
      "We ll go to Italy; you will get strong,  he said.",
      "Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your\nfamily with you?",
      "she said, looking close into his eyes.",
      "It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.",
      "Stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but I can t accept\n_his_ generosity,  she said, looking dreamily past Vronsky s face.",
      "I\ndon t want a divorce; it s all the same to me now.",
      "Only I don t know\nwhat he will decide about Seryozha.",
      "He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could\nremember and think of her son, of divorce.",
      "What did it all matter?",
      "Don t speak of that, don t think of it,  he said, turning her hand in\nhis, and trying to draw her attention to him; but still she did not\nlook at him.",
      "Oh, why didn t I die!",
      "it would have been better,  she said, and silent\ntears flowed down both her cheeks; but she tried to smile, so as not to\nwound him.",
      "To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would\nhave been, Vronsky had till then considered, disgraceful and\nimpossible.",
      "But now, without an instant s consideration, he declined\nit, and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this\nstep, he immediately retired from the army.",
      "A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his\nhouse at Petersburg, while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad, not having\nobtained a divorce, but having absolutely declined all idea of one.",
      "PART FIVE\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nPrincess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for\nthe wedding to take place before Lent, just five weeks off, since not\nhalf the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time.",
      "But she could\nnot but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting\nit off too late, as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky s was seriously\nill and might die, and then the mourning would delay the wedding still\nlonger.",
      "And therefore, deciding to divide the trousseau into two\nparts a larger and smaller trousseau the princess consented to have the\nwedding before Lent.",
      "She determined that she would get the smaller part\nof the trousseau all ready now, and the larger part should be made\nlater, and she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of\ngiving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this\narrangement or not.",
      "The arrangement was the more suitable as,\nimmediately after the wedding, the young people were to go to the\ncountry, where the more important part of the trousseau would not be\nwanted.",
      "Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it\nseemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole\naim of all existence, and that he need not now think or care about\nanything, that everything was being done and would be done for him by\nothers.",
      "He had not even plans and aims for the future, he left its\narrangement to others, knowing that everything would be delightful.",
      "His\nbrother Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch, and the princess guided\nhim in doing what he had to do.",
      "All he did was to agree entirely with\neverything suggested to him.",
      "His brother raised money for him, the\nprincess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch advised him to go abroad.",
      "He agreed to everything.",
      "Do\nwhat you choose, if it amuses you.",
      "I m happy, and my happiness can be\nno greater and no less for anything you do,  he thought.",
      "When he told\nKitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch s advice that they should go abroad, he\nwas much surprised that she did not agree to this, and had some\ndefinite requirements of her own in regard to their future.",
      "She knew\nLevin had work he loved in the country.",
      "She did not, as he saw,\nunderstand this work, she did not even care to understand it.",
      "But that\ndid not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance.",
      "And then she knew their home would be in the country, and she wanted to\ngo, not abroad where she was not going to live, but to the place where\ntheir home would be.",
      "This definitely expressed purpose astonished\nLevin.",
      "But since he did not care either way, he immediately asked\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as though it were his duty, to go down to the\ncountry and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with\nthe taste of which he had so much.",
      "But I say,  Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come\nback from the country, where he had got everything ready for the young\npeople s arrival,  have you a certificate of having been at\nconfession?",
      "No.",
      "But what of it?",
      "You can t be married without it.",
      "_A e, a e, a e!_  cried Levin.",
      "Why, I believe it s nine years since\nI ve taken the sacrament!",
      "I never thought of it.",
      "You re a pretty fellow!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch laughing,  and you\ncall me a Nihilist!",
      "But this won t do, you know.",
      "You must take the\nsacrament.",
      "When?",
      "There are four days left now.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also, and Levin had to go to\nconfession.",
      "To Levin, as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of\nothers, it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part\nin church ceremonies.",
      "At this moment, in his present softened state of\nfeeling, sensitive to everything, this inevitable act of hypocrisy was\nnot merely painful to Levin, it seemed to him utterly impossible.",
      "Now,\nin the heyday of his highest glory, his fullest flower, he would have\nto be a liar or a scoffer.",
      "He felt incapable of being either.",
      "But\nthough he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the\npossibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating,\nStepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question.",
      "Besides, what is it to you two days?",
      "And he s an awfully nice clever\nold fellow.",
      "He ll pull the tooth out for you so gently, you won t\nnotice it.",
      "Standing at the first litany, Levin attempted to revive in himself his\nyouthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed\nthrough between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.",
      "But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him.",
      "He\nattempted to look at it all as an empty custom, having no sort of\nmeaning, like the custom of paying calls.",
      "But he felt that he could not\ndo that either.",
      "Levin found himself, like the majority of his\ncontemporaries, in the vaguest position in regard to religion.",
      "Believe\nhe could not, and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it\nwas all wrong.",
      "And consequently, not being able to believe in the\nsignificance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as\nan empty formality, during the whole period of preparing for the\nsacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at\ndoing what he did not himself understand, and what, as an inner voice\ntold him, was therefore false and wrong.",
      "During the service he would first listen to the prayers, trying to\nattach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views; then\nfeeling that he could not understand and must condemn them, he tried\nnot to listen to them, but to attend to the thoughts, observations, and\nmemories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during\nthis idle time of standing in church.",
      "He had stood through the litany, the evening service and the midnight\nservice, and the next day he got up earlier than usual, and without\nhaving tea went at eight o clock in the morning to the church for the\nmorning service and the confession.",
      "There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier, two old women, and\nthe church officials.",
      "A young deacon, whose long back showed in two\ndistinct halves through his thin undercassock, met him, and at once\ngoing to a little table at the wall read the exhortation.",
      "During the\nreading, especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same\nwords,  Lord, have mercy on us!",
      "which resounded with an echo, Levin\nfelt that thought was shut and sealed up, and that it must not be\ntouched or stirred now or confusion would be the result; and so\nstanding behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs,\nneither listening nor examining what was said.",
      "It s wonderful what\nexpression there is in her hand,  he thought, remembering how they had\nbeen sitting the day before at a corner table.",
      "They had nothing to talk\nabout, as was almost always the case at this time, and laying her hand\non the table she kept opening and shutting it, and laughed herself as\nshe watched her action.",
      "He remembered how he had kissed it and then had\nexamined the lines on the pink palm.",
      "Have mercy on us again!",
      "thought\nLevin, crossing himself, bowing, and looking at the supple spring of\nthe deacon s back bowing before him.",
      "She took my hand then and\nexamined the lines.",
      "You ve got a splendid hand,  she said.",
      "And he\nlooked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon.",
      "Yes, now it\nwill soon be over,  he thought.",
      "No, it seems to be beginning again, \nhe thought, listening to the prayers.",
      "No, it s just ending: there he\nis bowing down to the ground.",
      "That s always at the end.",
      "The deacon s hand in a plush cuff accepted a three-rouble note\nunobtrusively, and the deacon said he would put it down in the\nregister, and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of\nthe empty church, he went to the altar.",
      "A moment later he peeped out\nthence and beckoned to Levin.",
      "Thought, till then locked up, began to\nstir in Levin s head, but he made haste to drive it away.",
      "It will come\nright somehow,  he thought, and went towards the altar-rails.",
      "He went\nup the steps, and turning to the right saw the priest.",
      "The priest, a\nlittle old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary, good-natured\neyes, was standing at the altar-rails, turning over the pages of a\nmissal.",
      "With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers\nin the official voice.",
      "When he had finished them he bowed down to the\nground and turned, facing Levin.",
      "Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,  he said,\npointing to the crucifix.",
      "Do you believe in all the doctrines of the\nHoly Apostolic Church?",
      "the priest went on, turning his eyes away from\nLevin s face and folding his hands under his stole.",
      "I have doubted, I doubt everything,  said Levin in a voice that jarred\non himself, and he ceased speaking.",
      "The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more, and\nclosing his eyes he said quickly, with a broad, Vladimirsky accent:\n\n Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God\nin His mercy will strengthen us.",
      "What are your special sins?",
      "he added,\nwithout the slightest interval, as though anxious not to waste time.",
      "My chief sin is doubt.",
      "I have doubts of everything, and for the most\npart I am in doubt.",
      "Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,  the priest repeated the\nsame words.",
      "What do you doubt about principally?",
      "I doubt of everything.",
      "I sometimes even have doubts of the existence\nof God,  Levin could not help saying, and he was horrified at the\nimpropriety of what he was saying.",
      "But Levin s words did not, it\nseemed, make much impression on the priest.",
      "What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?",
      "he said\nhurriedly, with a just perceptible smile.",
      "Levin did not speak.",
      "What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?",
      "the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon.",
      "Who has decked the\nheavenly firmament with its lights?",
      "Who has clothed the earth in its\nbeauty?",
      "How explain it without the Creator?",
      "he said, looking\ninquiringly at Levin.",
      "Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical\ndiscussion with the priest, and so he said in reply merely what was a\ndirect answer to the question.",
      "I don t know,  he said.",
      "You don t know!",
      "Then how can you doubt that God created all?",
      "the\npriest said, with good-humored perplexity.",
      "I don t understand it at all,  said Levin, blushing, and feeling that\nhis words were stupid, and that they could not be anything but stupid\nin such a position.",
      "Pray to God and beseech Him.",
      "Even the holy fathers had doubts, and\nprayed to God to strengthen their faith.",
      "The devil has great power, and\nwe must resist him.",
      "Pray to God, beseech Him.",
      "Pray to God,  he repeated\nhurriedly.",
      "The priest paused for some time, as though meditating.",
      "You re about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son\nin the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?",
      "he resumed, with a smile.",
      "An\nexcellent young lady.",
      "Yes,  answered Levin, blushing for the priest.",
      "What does he want to\nask me about this at confession for?",
      "he thought.",
      "And, as though answering his thought, the priest said to him:\n\n You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with\noffspring.",
      "Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if\nyou do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to\ninfidelity?",
      "he said, with gentle reproachfulness.",
      "If you love your\nchild as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor\nfor your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual\nenlightenment with the light of truth.",
      "Eh?",
      "What answer will you make\nhim when the innocent babe asks you:  Papa!",
      "who made all that enchants\nme in this world the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the\ngrass?",
      "Can you say to him:  I don t know ?",
      "You cannot but know, since\nthe Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us.",
      "Or your child\nwill ask you:  What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?",
      "What will\nyou say to him when you know nothing?",
      "How will you answer him?",
      "Will you\nleave him to the allurements of the world and the devil?",
      "That s not\nright,  he said, and he stopped, putting his head on one side and\nlooking at Levin with his kindly, gentle eyes.",
      "Levin made no answer this time, not because he did not want to enter\nupon a discussion with the priest, but because, so far, no one had ever\nasked him such questions, and when his babes did ask him those\nquestions, it would be time enough to think about answering them.",
      "You are entering upon a time of life,  pursued the priest,  when you\nmust choose your path and keep to it.",
      "Pray to God that He may in His\nmercy aid you and have mercy on you!",
      "he concluded.",
      "Our Lord and God,\nJesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His loving-kindness,\nforgives this child....  and, finishing the prayer of absolution, the\npriest blessed him and dismissed him.",
      "On getting home that day, Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the\nawkward position being over and having been got through without his\nhaving to tell a lie.",
      "Apart from this, there remained a vague memory\nthat what the kind, nice old fellow had said had not been at all so\nstupid as he had fancied at first, and that there was something in it\nthat must be cleared up.",
      "Of course, not now,  thought Levin,  but some day later on.",
      "Levin\nfelt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not\nclean in his soul, and that, in regard to religion, he was in the same\nposition which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others, and for\nwhich he blamed his friend Sviazhsky.",
      "Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly s, and was in very\nhigh spirits.",
      "To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement\nin which he found himself, he said that he was happy like a dog being\ntrained to jump through a hoop, who, having at last caught the idea,\nand done what was required of him, whines and wags its tail, and jumps\nup to the table and the windows in its delight.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nOn the day of the wedding, according to the Russian custom (the\nprincess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the\ncustoms), Levin did not see his betrothed, and dined at his hotel with\nthree bachelor friends, casually brought together at his rooms.",
      "These\nwere Sergey Ivanovitch, Katavasov, a university friend, now professor\nof natural science, whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on\ntaking home with him, and Tchirikov, his best man, a Moscow\nconciliation-board judge, Levin s companion in his bear-hunts.",
      "The\ndinner was a very merry one: Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest\nmood, and was much amused by Katavasov s originality.",
      "Katavasov,\nfeeling his originality was appreciated and understood, made the most\nof it.",
      "Tchirikov always gave a lively and good-humored support to\nconversation of any sort.",
      "See, now,  said Katavasov, drawling his words from a habit acquired in\nthe lecture-room,  what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin\nDmitrievitch.",
      "I m not speaking of present company, for he s absent.",
      "At\nthe time he left the university he was fond of science, took an\ninterest in humanity; now one-half of his abilities is devoted to\ndeceiving himself, and the other to justifying the deceit.",
      "A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,  said\nSergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Oh, no, I m not an enemy of matrimony.",
      "I m in favor of division of\nlabor.",
      "People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the\nrest work for their happiness and enlightenment.",
      "That s how I look at\nit.",
      "To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I m not one of\ntheir number.",
      "How happy I shall be when I hear that you re in love!",
      "said Levin.",
      "Please invite me to the wedding.",
      "I m in love now.",
      "Yes, with a cuttlefish!",
      "You know,  Levin turned to his brother,\n Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of\nthe.... \n\n Now, make a muddle of it!",
      "It doesn t matter what about.",
      "And the fact\nis, I certainly do love cuttlefish.",
      "But that s no hindrance to your loving your wife.",
      "The cuttlefish is no hindrance.",
      "The wife is the hindrance.",
      "Why so?",
      "Oh, you ll see!",
      "You care about farming, hunting, well, you d better\nlook out!",
      "Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno, and\ntwo bears,  said Tchirikov.",
      "Well, you must go and get them without me.",
      "Ah, that s the truth,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "And you may say\ngood-bye to bear-hunting for the future your wife won t allow it!",
      "Levin smiled.",
      "The picture of his wife not letting him go was so\npleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon\nbears forever.",
      "Still, it s a pity they should get those two bears without you.",
      "Do you\nremember last time at Hapilovo?",
      "That was a delightful hunt!",
      "said\nTchirikov.",
      "Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there\ncould be something delightful apart from her, and so said nothing.",
      "There s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor\nlife,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "However happy you may be, you must\nregret your freedom.",
      "And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the\nwindow, like Gogol s bridegroom?",
      "Of course there is, but it isn t confessed,  said Katavasov, and he\nbroke into loud laughter.",
      "Oh, well, the window s open.",
      "Let s start off this instant to Tver!",
      "There s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair.",
      "Seriously,\nlet s go by the five o clock!",
      "And here let them do what they like, \nsaid Tchirikov, smiling.",
      "Well, now, on my honor,  said Levin, smiling,  I can t find in my\nheart that feeling of regret for my freedom.",
      "Yes, there s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can t find\nanything there,  said Katavasov.",
      "Wait a bit, when you set it to rights\na little, you ll find it!",
      "No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling  (he\ncould not say love before them)  and happiness, a certain regret at\nlosing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at the very loss of my\nfreedom.",
      "Awful!",
      "It s a hopeless case!",
      "said Katavasov.",
      "Well, let s drink to\nhis recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be\nrealized and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on\nearth!",
      "Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for\nthe wedding.",
      "When he was left alone, and recalled the conversation of these bachelor\nfriends, Levin asked himself: had he in his heart that regret for his\nfreedom of which they had spoken?",
      "He smiled at the question.",
      "Freedom!",
      "What is freedom for?",
      "Happiness is only in loving and wishing her\nwishes, thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at\nall that s happiness!",
      "But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?",
      "some voice\nsuddenly whispered to him.",
      "The smile died away from his face, and he\ngrew thoughtful.",
      "And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him.",
      "There\ncame over him a dread and doubt doubt of everything.",
      "What if she does not love me?",
      "What if she s marrying me simply to be\nmarried?",
      "What if she doesn t see herself what she s doing?",
      "he asked\nhimself.",
      "She may come to her senses, and only when she is being\nmarried realize that she does not and cannot love me.",
      "And strange,\nmost evil thoughts of her began to come to him.",
      "He was jealous of\nVronsky, as he had been a year ago, as though the evening he had seen\nher with Vronsky had been yesterday.",
      "He suspected she had not told him\neverything.",
      "He jumped up quickly.",
      "No, this can t go on!",
      "he said to himself in\ndespair.",
      "I ll go to her; I ll ask her; I ll say for the last time: we\nare free, and hadn t we better stay so?",
      "Anything s better than endless\nmisery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!",
      "With despair in his heart and bitter\nanger against all men, against himself, against her, he went out of the\nhotel and drove to her house.",
      "He found her in one of the back rooms.",
      "She was sitting on a chest and\nmaking some arrangements with her maid, sorting over heaps of dresses\nof different colors, spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor.",
      "Ah!",
      "she cried, seeing him, and beaming with delight.",
      "Kostya!",
      "Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "(These latter days she used these names\nalmost alternately.)",
      "I didn t expect you!",
      "I m going through my\nwardrobe to see what s for whom.... \n\n Oh!",
      "that s very nice!",
      "he said gloomily, looking at the maid.",
      "You can go, Dunyasha, I ll call you presently,  said Kitty.",
      "Kostya,\nwhat s the matter?",
      "she asked, definitely adopting this familiar name\nas soon as the maid had gone out.",
      "She noticed his strange face,\nagitated and gloomy, and a panic came over her.",
      "Kitty!",
      "I m in torture.",
      "I can t suffer alone,  he said with despair in\nhis voice, standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes.",
      "He saw already from her loving, truthful face, that nothing could come\nof what he had meant to say, but yet he wanted her to reassure him\nherself.",
      "I ve come to say that there s still time.",
      "This can all be\nstopped and set right.",
      "What?",
      "I don t understand.",
      "What is the matter?",
      "What I have said a thousand times over, and can t help thinking ...\nthat I m not worthy of you.",
      "You couldn t consent to marry me.",
      "Think a\nlittle.",
      "You ve made a mistake.",
      "Think it over thoroughly.",
      "You can t love\nme....",
      "If ... better say so,  he said, not looking at her.",
      "I shall be\nwretched.",
      "Let people say what they like; anything s better than\nmisery.... Far better now while there s still time....",
      "I don t understand,  she answered, panic-stricken;  you mean you want\nto give it up ... don t want it?",
      "Yes, if you don t love me.",
      "You re out of your mind!",
      "she cried, turning crimson with vexation.",
      "But his face was so piteous, that she restrained her vexation, and\nflinging some clothes off an armchair, she sat down beside him.",
      "What\nare you thinking?",
      "tell me all.",
      "I am thinking you can t love me.",
      "What can you love me for?",
      "My God!",
      "what can I do?...",
      "she said, and burst into tears.",
      "Oh!",
      "what have I done?",
      "he cried, and kneeling before her, he fell to\nkissing her hands.",
      "When the princess came into the room five minutes later, she found them\ncompletely reconciled.",
      "Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved\nhim, but had gone so far in answer to his question, what she loved him\nfor as to explain what for.",
      "She told him that she loved him because she\nunderstood him completely, because she knew what he would like, and\nbecause everything he liked was good.",
      "And this seemed to him perfectly\nclear.",
      "When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side\non the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty s wanting to\ngive Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed\nto her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given away, but\nDunyasha must have the blue one.",
      "How is it you don t see?",
      "She s a brunette, and it won t suit her....",
      "I ve worked it all out.",
      "Hearing why he had come, the princess was half humorously, half\nseriously angry with him, and sent him home to dress and not to hinder\nKitty s hair-dressing, as Charles the hair-dresser was just coming.",
      "As it is, she s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks,\nand then you must come and upset her with your nonsense,  she said to\nhim.",
      "Get along with you, my dear!",
      "Levin, guilty and shamefaced, but pacified, went back to his hotel.",
      "His\nbrother, Darya Alexandrovna, and Stepan Arkadyevitch, all in full\ndress, were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture.",
      "There\nwas no time to lose.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to\nfetch her curled and pomaded son, who was to carry the holy pictures\nafter the bride.",
      "Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man, and\nanother that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent\nback....",
      "Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to\nbe considered and arranged.",
      "One thing was unmistakable, that there must\nbe no delay, as it was already half-past six.",
      "Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy\npicture.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside\nhis wife, took the holy picture, and telling Levin to bow down to the\nground, he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and kissed him\nthree times; Darya Alexandrovna did the same, and immediately was in a\nhurry to get off, and again plunged into the intricate question of the\ndestinations of the various carriages.",
      "Come, I ll tell you how we ll manage: you drive in our carriage to\nfetch him, and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he ll be so good, will drive there\nand then send his carriage.",
      "Of course; I shall be delighted.",
      "We ll come on directly with him.",
      "Are your things sent off?",
      "said\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Yes,  answered Levin, and he told Kouzma to put out his clothes for\nhim to dress.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nA crowd of people, principally women, was thronging round the church\nlighted up for the wedding.",
      "Those who had not succeeded in getting into\nthe main entrance were crowding about the windows, pushing, wrangling,\nand peeping through the gratings.",
      "More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the\nstreet by the police.",
      "A police officer, regardless of the frost, stood\nat the entrance, gorgeous in his uniform.",
      "More carriages were\ncontinually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their\ntrains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking\ninto the church.",
      "Inside the church both lusters were already lighted,\nand all the candles before the holy pictures.",
      "The gilt on the red\nground of the holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures,\nand the silver of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the\nfloor, and the rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps\nof the altar, and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and\nsurplices all were flooded with light.",
      "On the right side of the warm\nchurch, in the crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and\nbroadcloth, velvet, satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms\nand long gloves, there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed\nstrangely in the high cupola.",
      "Every time there was heard the creak of\nthe opened door the conversation in the crowd died away, and everybody\nlooked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in.",
      "But the\ndoor had opened more than ten times, and each time it was either a\nbelated guest or guests, who joined the circle of the invited on the\nright, or a spectator, who had eluded or softened the police officer,\nand went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left.",
      "Both the guests\nand the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of\nanticipation.",
      "At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive\nimmediately, and attached no importance at all to their being late.",
      "Then they began to look more and more often towards the door, and to\ntalk of whether anything could have happened.",
      "Then the long delay began\nto be positively discomforting, and relations and guests tried to look\nas if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in\nconversation.",
      "The head deacon, as though to remind them of the value of his time,\ncoughed impatiently, making the window-panes quiver in their frames.",
      "In\nthe choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and\nblowing their noses.",
      "The priest was continually sending first the\nbeadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not\ncome, more and more often he went himself, in a lilac vestment and an\nembroidered sash, to the side door, expecting to see the bridegroom.",
      "At\nlast one of the ladies, glancing at her watch, said,  It really is\nstrange, though!",
      "and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly\nexpressing their wonder and dissatisfaction.",
      "One of the bridegroom s\nbest men went to find out what had happened.",
      "Kitty meanwhile had long\nago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long veil and wreath\nof orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the\nShtcherbatskys  house with her sister, Madame Lvova, who was her\nbridal-mother.",
      "She was looking out of the window, and had been for over\nhalf an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her\nbridegroom was at the church.",
      "Levin meanwhile, in his trousers, but without his coat and waistcoat,\nwas walking to and fro in his room at the hotel, continually putting\nhis head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor.",
      "But in\nthe corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he\ncame back in despair, and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan\nArkadyevitch, who was smoking serenely.",
      "Was ever a man in such a fearful fool s position?",
      "he said.",
      "Yes, it is stupid,  Stepan Arkadyevitch assented, smiling soothingly.",
      "But don t worry, it ll be brought directly.",
      "No, what is to be done!",
      "said Levin, with smothered fury.",
      "And these\nfools of open waistcoats!",
      "Out of the question!",
      "he said, looking at the\ncrumpled front of his shirt.",
      "And what if the things have been taken on\nto the railway station!",
      "he roared in desperation.",
      "Then you must put on mine.",
      "I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.",
      "It s not nice to look ridiculous....",
      "Wait a bit!",
      "it will _come\nround_.",
      "The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit, Kouzma, his\nold servant, had brought him the coat, waistcoat, and everything that\nwas wanted.",
      "But the shirt!",
      "cried Levin.",
      "You ve got a shirt on,  Kouzma answered, with a placid smile.",
      "Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt, and on receiving\ninstructions to pack up everything and send it round to the\nShtcherbatskys  house, from which the young people were to set out the\nsame evening, he had done so, packing everything but the dress suit.",
      "The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question\nwith the fashionable open waistcoat.",
      "It was a long way to send to the\nShtcherbatskys .",
      "They sent out to buy a shirt.",
      "The servant came back;\neverything was shut up it was Sunday.",
      "They sent to Stepan\nArkadyevitch s and brought a shirt it was impossibly wide and short.",
      "They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys  to unpack the things.",
      "The\nbridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down\nhis room like a wild beast in a cage, peeping out into the corridor,\nand with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to\nKitty and what she might be thinking now.",
      "At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt.",
      "Only just in time.",
      "They were just lifting it into the van,  said\nKouzma.",
      "Three minutes later Levin ran full speed into the corridor, not looking\nat his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings.",
      "You won t help matters like this,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a\nsmile, hurrying with more deliberation after him.",
      "It will come round,\nit will come round ...",
      "I tell you.",
      "Chapter 4\n\n They ve come!",
      "Here he is!",
      "Which one?",
      "Rather young, eh?",
      "Why, my\ndear soul, she looks more dead than alive!",
      "were the comments in the\ncrowd, when Levin, meeting his bride in the entrance, walked with her\ninto the church.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay, and the\nguests were whispering it with smiles to one another.",
      "Levin saw nothing\nand no one; he did not take his eyes off his bride.",
      "Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late, and was not\nnearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual; but Levin did not think\nso.",
      "He looked at her hair done up high, with the long white veil and\nwhite flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a\nmaidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in\nfront, her strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him that she\nlooked better than ever not because these flowers, this veil, this gown\nfrom Paris added anything to her beauty; but because, in spite of the\nelaborate sumptuousness of her attire, the expression of her sweet\nface, of her eyes, of her lips was still her own characteristic\nexpression of guileless truthfulness.",
      "I was beginning to think you meant to run away,  she said, and smiled\nto him.",
      "It s so stupid, what happened to me, I m ashamed to speak of it!",
      "he\nsaid, reddening, and he was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch, who\ncame up to him.",
      "This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!",
      "said Sergey\nIvanovitch, shaking his head and smiling.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "answered Levin, without an idea of what they were talking\nabout.",
      "Now, Kostya, you have to decide,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air\nof mock dismay,  a weighty question.",
      "You are at this moment just in the\nhumor to appreciate all its gravity.",
      "They ask me, are they to light the\ncandles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been\nlighted?",
      "It s a matter of ten roubles,  he added, relaxing his lips\ninto a smile.",
      "I have decided, but I was afraid you might not agree.",
      "Levin saw it was a joke, but he could not smile.",
      "Well, how s it to be then?",
      "unlighted or lighted candles?",
      "that s the\nquestion.",
      "Yes, yes, unlighted.",
      "Oh, I m very glad.",
      "The question s decided!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nsmiling.",
      "How silly men are, though, in this position,  he said to\nTchirikov, when Levin, after looking absently at him, had moved back to\nhis bride.",
      "Kitty, mind you re the first to step on the carpet,  said Countess\nNordston, coming up.",
      "You re a nice person!",
      "she said to Levin.",
      "Aren t you frightened, eh?",
      "said Marya Dmitrievna, an old aunt.",
      "Are you cold?",
      "You re pale.",
      "Stop a minute, stoop down,  said Kitty s\nsister, Madame Lvova, and with her plump, handsome arms she smilingly\nset straight the flowers on her head.",
      "Dolly came up, tried to say something, but could not speak, cried, and\nthen laughed unnaturally.",
      "Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin.",
      "Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments, and the\npriest and deacon came out to the lectern, which stood in the forepart\nof the church.",
      "The priest turned to Levin saying something.",
      "Levin did\nnot hear what the priest said.",
      "Take the bride s hand and lead her up,  the best man said to Levin.",
      "It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of\nhim.",
      "For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin\nagain because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong\narm till he understood at last that what he had to do was, without\nchanging his position, to take her right hand in his right hand.",
      "When\nat last he had taken the bride s hand in the correct way, the priest\nwalked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern.",
      "The\ncrowd of friends and relations moved after them, with a buzz of talk\nand a rustle of skirts.",
      "Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride s\ntrain.",
      "The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard\nfalling from the candles.",
      "The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap, with his long\nsilvery-gray locks of hair parted behind his ears, was fumbling with\nsomething at the lectern, putting out his little old hands from under\nthe heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously, whispered something, and\nmaking a sign to Levin, walked back again.",
      "The priest lighted two candles, wreathed with flowers, and holding them\nsideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned, facing the\nbridal pair.",
      "The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin.",
      "He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom,\nsighed, and putting his right hand out from his vestment, blessed the\nbridegroom with it, and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid\nthe crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty.",
      "Then he gave them the\ncandles, and taking the censer, moved slowly away from them.",
      "Can it be true?",
      "thought Levin, and he looked round at his bride.",
      "Looking down at her he saw her face in profile, and from the scarcely\nperceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of\nhis eyes upon her.",
      "She did not look round, but the high scalloped\ncollar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly.",
      "He saw that\na sigh was held back in her throat, and the little hand in the long\nglove shook as it held the candle.",
      "All the fuss of the shirt, of being late, all the talk of friends and\nrelations, their annoyance, his ludicrous position all suddenly passed\naway and he was filled with joy and dread.",
      "The handsome, stately head-deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly\nlocks standing out at each side of his head, stepped smartly forward,\nand lifting his stole on two fingers, stood opposite the priest.",
      "Blessed be the name of the Lord,  the solemn syllables rang out slowly\none after another, setting the air quivering with waves of sound.",
      "Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and ever\nshall be,  the little old priest answered in a submissive, piping\nvoice, still fingering something at the lectern.",
      "And the full chorus of\nthe unseen choir rose up, filling the whole church, from the windows to\nthe vaulted roof, with broad waves of melody.",
      "It grew stronger, rested\nfor an instant, and slowly died away.",
      "They prayed, as they always do, for peace from on high and for\nsalvation, for the Holy Synod, and for the Tsar; they prayed, too, for\nthe servants of God, Konstantin and Ekaterina, now plighting their\ntroth.",
      "Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we\nbeseech Thee,  the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the\nhead deacon.",
      "Levin heard the words, and they impressed him.",
      "How did they guess that\nit is help, just help that one wants?",
      "he thought, recalling all his\nfears and doubts of late.",
      "What do I know?",
      "what can I do in this\nfearful business,  he thought,  without help?",
      "Yes, it is help I want\nnow.",
      "When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family, the\npriest turned to the bridal pair with a book:  Eternal God, that\njoinest together in love them that were separate,  he read in a gentle,\npiping voice:  who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot\nbe set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their\ndescendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants,\nKonstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.",
      "For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.",
      "Amen!",
      "the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air.",
      "Joinest together in love them that were separate.",
      "What deep meaning\nin those words, and how they correspond with what one feels at this\nmoment,  thought Levin.",
      "Is she feeling the same as I?",
      "And looking round, he met her eyes, and from their expression he\nconcluded that she was understanding it just as he was.",
      "But this was a\nmistake; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the\nservice; she had not heard them, in fact.",
      "She could not listen to them\nand take them in, so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast\nand grew stronger and stronger.",
      "That feeling was joy at the completion\nof the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in\nher soul, and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to\nher.",
      "On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street\nshe had gone up to him in her brown dress, and given herself to him\nwithout a word on that day, at that hour, there took place in her heart\na complete severance from all her old life, and a quite different, new,\nutterly strange life had begun for her, while the old life was actually\ngoing on as before.",
      "Those six weeks had for her been a time of the\nutmost bliss and the utmost misery.",
      "All her life, all her desires and\nhopes were concentrated on this one man, still uncomprehended by her,\nto whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and\nrepulsion, even less comprehended than the man himself, and all the\nwhile she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old\nlife.",
      "Living the old life, she was horrified at herself, at her utter\ninsurmountable callousness to all her own past, to things, to habits,\nto the people she had loved, who loved her to her mother, who was\nwounded by her indifference, to her kind, tender father, till then\ndearer than all the world.",
      "At one moment she was horrified at this\nindifference, at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this\nindifference.",
      "She could not frame a thought, not a wish apart from life\nwith this man; but this new life was not yet, and she could not even\npicture it clearly to herself.",
      "There was only anticipation, the dread\nand joy of the new and the unknown.",
      "And now behold anticipation and\nuncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life all was\nending, and the new was beginning.",
      "This new life could not but have\nterrors for her inexperience; but, terrible or not, the change had been\nwrought six weeks before in her soul, and this was merely the final\nsanction of what had long been completed in her heart.",
      "Turning again to the lectern, the priest with some difficulty took\nKitty s little ring, and asking Levin for his hand, put it on the first\njoint of his finger.",
      "The servant of God, Konstantin, plights his troth\nto the servant of God, Ekaterina.",
      "And putting his big ring on Kitty s\ntouchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing.",
      "And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to\ndo, and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in\na whisper.",
      "At last, having duly performed the ceremony, having signed\nthe rings with the cross, the priest handed Kitty the big ring, and\nLevin the little one.",
      "Again they were puzzled, and passed the rings\nfrom hand to hand, still without doing what was expected.",
      "Dolly, Tchirikov, and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them\nright.",
      "There was an interval of hesitation, whispering, and smiles; but\nthe expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did\nnot change: on the contrary, in their perplexity over their hands they\nlooked more grave and deeply moved than before, and the smile with\nwhich Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each\nput on their own ring died away on his lips.",
      "He had a feeling that any\nsmile would jar on them.",
      "Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,  the priest\nread after the exchange of rings,  from Thee woman was given to man to\nbe a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation of children.",
      "O Lord, our\nGod, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy\nHoly Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our fathers, from generation to\ngeneration, bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their\ntroth fast in faith, and union of hearts, and truth, and love.... \n\nLevin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage, all his dreams\nof how he would order his life, were mere childishness, and that it was\nsomething he had not understood hitherto, and now understood less than\never, though it was being performed upon him.",
      "The lump in his throat\nrose higher and higher, tears that would not be checked came into his\neyes.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nIn the church there was all Moscow, all the friends and relations; and\nduring the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted\nchurch, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the\ncircle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties,\nfrockcoats, and uniforms.",
      "The talk was principally kept up by the men,\nwhile the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony,\nwhich always means so much to them.",
      "In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters: Dolly,\nand the other one, the self-possessed beauty, Madame Lvova, who had\njust arrived from abroad.",
      "Why is it Marie s in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?",
      "said\nMadame Korsunskaya.",
      "With her complexion, it s the one salvation,  responded Madame\nTrubetskaya.",
      "I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening?",
      "It s\nlike shop-people....",
      "So much prettier.",
      "I was married in the evening too....  answered\nMadame Korsunskaya, and she sighed, remembering how charming she had\nbeen that day, and how absurdly in love her husband was, and how\ndifferent it all was now.",
      "They say if anyone s best man more than ten times, he ll never be\nmarried.",
      "I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken, \nsaid Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya, who had designs\non him.",
      "Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile.",
      "She looked at Kitty,\nthinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty s\nplace, and how she would remind him then of his joke today.",
      "Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor, Madame Nikolaeva, that he\nmeant to put the crown on Kitty s chignon for luck.",
      "She ought not to have worn a chignon,  answered Madame Nikolaeva, who\nhad long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was\nangling for married her, the wedding should be of the simplest.",
      "I\ndon t like such grandeur.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna, jestingly assuring\nher that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common\nbecause newly married people always felt a little ashamed of\nthemselves.",
      "Your brother may feel proud of himself.",
      "She s a marvel of sweetness.",
      "I\nbelieve you re envious.",
      "Oh, I ve got over that, Darya Dmitrievna,  he answered, and a\nmelancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister-in-law his joke about\ndivorce.",
      "The wreath wants setting straight,  she answered, not hearing him.",
      "What a pity she s lost her looks so,  Countess Nordston said to Madame\nLvova.",
      "Still he s not worth her little finger, is he?",
      "Oh, I like him so not because he s my future _beau-fr re_,  answered\nMadame Lvova.",
      "And how well he s behaving!",
      "It s so difficult, too, to\nlook well in such a position, not to be ridiculous.",
      "And he s not\nridiculous, and not affected; one can see he s moved.",
      "You expected it, I suppose?",
      "Almost.",
      "She always cared for him.",
      "Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first.",
      "I warned\nKitty.",
      "It will make no difference,  said Madame Lvova;  we re all obedient\nwives; it s in our family.",
      "Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose.",
      "And you, Dolly?",
      "Dolly stood beside them; she heard them, but she did not answer.",
      "She\nwas deeply moved.",
      "The tears stood in her eyes, and she could not have\nspoken without crying.",
      "She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin; going\nback in thought to her own wedding, she glanced at the radiant figure\nof Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgot all the present, and remembered only her\nown innocent love.",
      "She recalled not herself only, but all her\nwomen-friends and acquaintances.",
      "She thought of them on the one day of\ntheir triumph, when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown,\nwith love and hope and dread in their hearts, renouncing the past, and\nstepping forward into the mysterious future.",
      "Among the brides that came\nback to her memory, she thought too of her darling Anna, of whose\nproposed divorce she had just been hearing.",
      "And she had stood just as\ninnocent in orange flowers and bridal veil.",
      "And now?",
      "It s terribly\nstrange,  she said to herself.",
      "It was not merely the sisters, the\nwomen-friends and female relations of the bride who were following\nevery detail of the ceremony.",
      "Women who were quite strangers, mere\nspectators, were watching it excitedly, holding their breath, in fear\nof losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom,\nand angrily not answering, often not hearing, the remarks of the\ncallous men, who kept making joking or irrelevant observations.",
      "Why has she been crying?",
      "Is she being married against her will?",
      "Against her will to a fine fellow like that?",
      "A prince, isn t he?",
      "Is that her sister in the white satin?",
      "Just listen how the deacon\nbooms out,  And fearing her husband.",
      "Are the choristers from Tchudovo?",
      "No, from the Synod.",
      "I asked the footman.",
      "He says he s going to take her home to his\ncountry place at once.",
      "Awfully rich, they say.",
      "That s why she s being\nmarried to him.",
      "No, they re a well-matched pair.",
      "I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away\ncrinolines were not being worn.",
      "Just look at her in the puce dress an\nambassador s wife they say she is how her skirt bounces out from side\nto side!",
      "What a pretty dear the bride is like a lamb decked with flowers!",
      "Well,\nsay what you will, we women feel for our sister.",
      "Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded\nin slipping in at the church doors.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nWhen the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before\nthe lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff,\nthe choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and\ntenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round\npointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug.",
      "Though both had often\nheard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the\nrug will be the head of the house, neither Levin nor Kitty were capable\nof recollecting it, as they took the few steps towards it.",
      "They did not\nhear the loud remarks and disputes that followed, some maintaining he\nhad stepped on first, and others that both had stepped on together.",
      "After the customary questions, whether they desired to enter upon\nmatrimony, and whether they were pledged to anyone else, and their\nanswers, which sounded strange to themselves, a new ceremony began.",
      "Kitty listened to the words of the prayer, trying to make out their\nmeaning, but she could not.",
      "The feeling of triumph and radiant\nhappiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on, and\ndeprived her of all power of attention.",
      "They prayed:  Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and\nvouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and\ndaughters.",
      "They alluded to God s creation of a wife from Adam s rib\n and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave\nunto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh,  and that  this is a\ngreat mystery ; they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless\nthem, like Isaac and Rebecca, Joseph, Moses and Zipporah, and that they\nmight look upon their children s children.",
      "That s all splendid, \nthought Kitty, catching the words,  all that s just as it should be, \nand a smile of happiness, unconsciously reflected in everyone who\nlooked at her, beamed on her radiant face.",
      "Put it on quite,  voices were heard urging when the priest had put on\nthe wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky, his hand shaking in its\nthree-button glove, held the crown high above her head.",
      "Put it on!",
      "she whispered, smiling.",
      "Levin looked round at her, and was struck by the joyful radiance on her\nface, and unconsciously her feeling infected him.",
      "He too, like her felt\nglad and happy.",
      "They enjoyed hearing the epistle read, and the roll of the head\ndeacon s voice at the last verse, awaited with such impatience by the\noutside public.",
      "They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm\nred wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest,\nflinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them\nround the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting  Glory\nto God.",
      "Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov, supporting the crowns and stumbling over\nthe bride s train, smiling too and seeming delighted at something, were\nat one moment left behind, at the next treading on the bridal pair as\nthe priest came to a halt.",
      "The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to\nhave infected everyone in the church.",
      "It seemed to Levin that the\npriest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did.",
      "Taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and\ncongratulated the young people.",
      "Levin looked at Kitty, and he had never\nbefore seen her look as she did.",
      "She was charming with the new radiance\nof happiness in her face.",
      "Levin longed to say something to her, but he\ndid not know whether it was all over.",
      "The priest got him out of his\ndifficulty.",
      "He smiled his kindly smile and said gently,  Kiss your\nwife, and you kiss your husband,  and took the candles out of their\nhands.",
      "Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care, gave her his arm, and\nwith a new strange sense of closeness, walked out of the church.",
      "He did\nnot believe, he could not believe, that it was true.",
      "It was only when\ntheir wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it, because he\nfelt that they were one.",
      "After supper, the same night, the young people left for the country.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nVronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in\nEurope.",
      "They had visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and had just arrived\nat a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time.",
      "A handsome\nhead waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an\nevening coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of\ntrinkets hanging above his rounded stomach, stood with his hands in the\nfull curve of his pockets, looking contemptuously from under his\neyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped\nhim.",
      "Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the\nentry towards the staircase, the head waiter turned round, and seeing\nthe Russian count, who had taken their best rooms, he took his hands\nout of his pockets deferentially, and with a bow informed him that a\ncourier had been, and that the business about the palazzo had been\narranged.",
      "The steward was prepared to sign the agreement.",
      "Ah!",
      "I m glad to hear it,  said Vronsky.",
      "Is madame at home or not?",
      "Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,  answered the\nwaiter.",
      "Vronsky took off his soft, wide-brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief\nover his heated brow and hair, which had grown half over his ears, and\nwas brushed back covering the bald patch on his head.",
      "And glancing\ncasually at the gentleman, who still stood there gazing intently at\nhim, he would have gone on.",
      "This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you,  said the\nhead waiter.",
      "With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from\nacquaintances anywhere, and longing to find some sort of diversion from\nthe monotony of his life, Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman,\nwho had retreated and stood still again, and at the same moment a light\ncame into the eyes of both.",
      "Golenishtchev!",
      "Vronsky!",
      "It really was Golenishtchev, a comrade of Vronsky s in the Corps of\nPages.",
      "In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party; he\nleft the corps without entering the army, and had never taken office\nunder the government.",
      "Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways\non leaving the corps, and had only met once since.",
      "At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a\nsort of lofty, intellectually liberal line, and was consequently\ndisposed to look down upon Vronsky s interests and calling in life.",
      "Hence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so\nwell knew how to assume, the meaning of which was:  You may like or\ndislike my way of life, that s a matter of the most perfect\nindifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want\nto know me.",
      "Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the\ntone taken by Vronsky.",
      "This second meeting might have been expected,\none would have supposed, to estrange them still more.",
      "But now they\nbeamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another.",
      "Vronsky\nwould never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev, but\nprobably he was not himself aware how bored he was.",
      "He forgot the\ndisagreeable impression of their last meeting, and with a face of frank\ndelight held out his hand to his old comrade.",
      "The same expression of\ndelight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev s face.",
      "How glad I am to meet you!",
      "said Vronsky, showing his strong white\nteeth in a friendly smile.",
      "I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn t know which one.",
      "I m very, very\nglad!",
      "Let s go in.",
      "Come, tell me what you re doing.",
      "I ve been living here for two years.",
      "I m working.",
      "Ah!",
      "said Vronsky, with sympathy;  let s go in.",
      "And with the habit\ncommon with Russians, instead of saying in Russian what he wanted to\nkeep from the servants, he began to speak in French.",
      "Do you know Madame Karenina?",
      "We are traveling together.",
      "I am going to\nsee her now,  he said in French, carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev s\nface.",
      "Ah!",
      "I did not know  (though he did know), Golenishtchev answered\ncarelessly.",
      "Have you been here long?",
      "he added.",
      "Four days,  Vronsky answered, once more scrutinizing his friend s face\nintently.",
      "Yes, he s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly, \nVronsky said to himself, catching the significance of Golenishtchev s\nface and the change of subject.",
      "I can introduce him to Anna, he looks\nat it properly.",
      "During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna, he\nhad always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would\nlook at his relations with Anna, and for the most part, in men, he had\nmet with the  proper  way of looking at it.",
      "But if he had been asked,\nand those who looked at it  properly  had been asked, exactly how they\ndid look at it, both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to\nanswer.",
      "In reality, those who in Vronsky s opinion had the  proper  view had no\nsort of view at all, but behaved in general as well-bred persons do\nbehave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which\nlife is encompassed on all sides; they behaved with propriety, avoiding\nallusions and unpleasant questions.",
      "They assumed an air of fully\ncomprehending the import and force of the situation, of accepting and\neven approving of it, but of considering it superfluous and uncalled\nfor to put all this into words.",
      "Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class, and\ntherefore was doubly pleased to see him.",
      "And in fact, Golenishtchev s\nmanner to Madame Karenina, when he was taken to call on her, was all\nthat Vronsky could have desired.",
      "Obviously without the slightest effort\nhe steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment.",
      "He had never met Anna before, and was struck by her beauty, and still\nmore by the frankness with which she accepted her position.",
      "She blushed\nwhen Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev, and he was extremely charmed by\nthis childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face.",
      "But\nwhat he liked particularly was the way in which at once, as though on\npurpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider, she\ncalled Vronsky simply Alexey, and said they were moving into a house\nthey had just taken, what was here called a palazzo.",
      "Golenishtchev\nliked this direct and simple attitude to her own position.",
      "Looking at\nAnna s manner of simple-hearted, spirited gaiety, and knowing Alexey\nAlexandrovitch and Vronsky, Golenishtchev fancied that he understood\nher perfectly.",
      "He fancied that he understood what she was utterly\nunable to understand: how it was that, having made her husband\nwretched, having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name, she\nyet felt full of spirits, gaiety, and happiness.",
      "It s in the guide-book,  said Golenishtchev, referring to the palazzo\nVronsky had taken.",
      "There s a first-rate Tintoretto there.",
      "One of his\nlatest period.",
      "I tell you what: it s a lovely day, let s go and have another look at\nit,  said Vronsky, addressing Anna.",
      "I shall be very glad to; I ll go and put on my hat.",
      "Would you say it s\nhot?",
      "she said, stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly\nat Vronsky.",
      "And again a vivid flush overspread her face.",
      "Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared\nto be with Golenishtchev, and so was afraid of not behaving as he would\nwish.",
      "He looked a long, tender look at her.",
      "No, not very,  he said.",
      "And it seemed to her that she understood everything, most of all, that\nhe was pleased with her; and smiling to him, she walked with her rapid\nstep out at the door.",
      "The friends glanced at one another, and a look of hesitation came into\nboth faces, as though Golenishtchev, unmistakably admiring her, would\nhave liked to say something about her, and could not find the right\nthing to say, while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so.",
      "Well then,  Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort;  so\nyou re settled here?",
      "You re still at the same work, then?",
      "he went on,\nrecalling that he had been told Golenishtchev was writing something.",
      "Yes, I m writing the second part of the _Two Elements_,  said\nGolenishtchev, coloring with pleasure at the question that is, to be\nexact, I am not writing it yet; I am preparing, collecting materials.",
      "It will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.",
      "We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,  and he\nlaunched into a long and heated explanation of his views.",
      "Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the\nfirst part of the _Two Elements_, of which the author spoke as\nsomething well known.",
      "But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his\nopinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the\n_Two Elements_, he listened to him with some interest, for\nGolenishtchev spoke well.",
      "But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the\nnervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject\nthat engrossed him.",
      "As he went on talking, his eyes glittered more and\nmore angrily; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary\nopponents, and his face grew more and more excited and worried.",
      "Remembering Golenishtchev, a thin, lively, good-natured and well-bred\nboy, always at the head of the class, Vronsky could not make out the\nreason of his irritability, and he did not like it.",
      "What he\nparticularly disliked was that Golenishtchev, a man belonging to a good\nset, should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows, with\nwhom he was irritated and angry.",
      "Was it worth it?",
      "Vronsky disliked it,\nyet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy, and was sorry for him.",
      "Unhappiness, almost mental derangement, was visible on his mobile,\nrather handsome face, while without even noticing Anna s coming in, he\nwent on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views.",
      "When Anna came in in her hat and cape, and her lovely hand rapidly\nswinging her parasol, and stood beside him, it was with a feeling of\nrelief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev\nwhich fastened persistently upon him, and with a fresh rush of love\nlooked at his charming companion, full of life and happiness.",
      "Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort, and at first was\ndejected and gloomy, but Anna, disposed to feel friendly with everyone\nas she was at that time, soon revived his spirits by her direct and\nlively manner.",
      "After trying various subjects of conversation, she got\nhim upon painting, of which he talked very well, and she listened to\nhim attentively.",
      "They walked to the house they had taken, and looked\nover it.",
      "I am very glad of one thing,  said Anna to Golenishtchev when they\nwere on their way back,  Alexey will have a capital _atelier_.",
      "You must\ncertainly take that room,  she said to Vronsky in Russian, using the\naffectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would\nbecome intimate with them in their isolation, and that there was no\nneed of reserve before him.",
      "Do you paint?",
      "said Golenishtchev, turning round quickly to Vronsky.",
      "Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a little, \nsaid Vronsky, reddening.",
      "He has great talent,  said Anna with a delighted smile.",
      "I m no judge,\nof course.",
      "But good judges have said the same.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nAnna, in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to\nhealth, felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life.",
      "The thought of her husband s unhappiness did not poison her happiness.",
      "On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of.",
      "On the other\nside her husband s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be\nregretted.",
      "The memory of all that had happened after her illness: her\nreconciliation with her husband, its breakdown, the news of Vronsky s\nwound, his visit, the preparations for divorce, the departure from her\nhusband s house, the parting from her son all that seemed to her like a\ndelirious dream, from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad.",
      "The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling\nlike repulsion, and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has\nshaken off another man clinging to him.",
      "That man did drown.",
      "It was an\nevil action, of course, but it was the sole means of escape, and better\nnot to brood over these fearful facts.",
      "One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the\nfirst moment of the final rupture, and when now she recalled all the\npast, she remembered that one reflection.",
      "I have inevitably made that\nman wretched,  she thought;  but I don t want to profit by his misery.",
      "I too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above\neverything I am losing my good name and my son.",
      "I have done wrong, and\nso I don t want happiness, I don t want a divorce, and shall suffer\nfrom my shame and the separation from my child.",
      "But, however sincerely\nAnna had meant to suffer, she was not suffering.",
      "Shame there was not.",
      "With the tact of which both had such a large share, they had succeeded\nin avoiding Russian ladies abroad, and so had never placed themselves\nin a false position, and everywhere they had met people who pretended\nthat they perfectly understood their position, far better indeed than\nthey did themselves.",
      "Separation from the son she loved even that did\nnot cause her anguish in these early days.",
      "The baby girl _his_\nchild was so sweet, and had so won Anna s heart, since she was all that\nwas left her, that Anna rarely thought of her son.",
      "The desire for life, waxing stronger with recovered health, was so\nintense, and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant, that Anna\nfelt unpardonably happy.",
      "The more she got to know Vronsky, the more she\nloved him.",
      "She loved him for himself, and for his love for her.",
      "Her\ncomplete ownership of him was a continual joy to her.",
      "His presence was\nalways sweet to her.",
      "All the traits of his character, which she learned\nto know better and better, were unutterably dear to her.",
      "His\nappearance, changed by his civilian dress, was as fascinating to her as\nthough she were some young girl in love.",
      "In everything he said,\nthought, and did, she saw something particularly noble and elevated.",
      "Her adoration of him alarmed her indeed; she sought and could not find\nin him anything not fine.",
      "She dared not show him her sense of her own\ninsignificance beside him.",
      "It seemed to her that, knowing this, he\nmight sooner cease to love her; and she dreaded nothing now so much as\nlosing his love, though she had no grounds for fearing it.",
      "But she\ncould not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her, and\nshowing that she appreciated it.",
      "He, who had in her opinion such a\nmarked aptitude for a political career, in which he would have been\ncertain to play a leading part he had sacrificed his ambition for her\nsake, and never betrayed the slightest regret.",
      "He was more lovingly\nrespectful to her than ever, and the constant care that she should not\nfeel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single\ninstant.",
      "He, so manly a man, never opposed her, had indeed, with her,\nno will of his own, and was anxious, it seemed, for nothing but to\nanticipate her wishes.",
      "And she could not but appreciate this, even\nthough the very intensity of his solicitude for her, the atmosphere of\ncare with which he surrounded her, sometimes weighed upon her.",
      "Vronsky, meanwhile, in spite of the complete realization of what he had\nso long desired, was not perfectly happy.",
      "He soon felt that the\nrealization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of\nthe mountain of happiness he had expected.",
      "It showed him the mistake\nmen make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of\ntheir desires.",
      "For a time after joining his life to hers, and putting\non civilian dress, he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of\nwhich he had known nothing before, and of freedom in his love, and he\nwas content, but not for long.",
      "He was soon aware that there was\nspringing up in his heart a desire for desires _ennui_.",
      "Without\nconscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice, taking\nit for a desire and an object.",
      "Sixteen hours of the day must be\noccupied in some way, since they were living abroad in complete\nfreedom, outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in\nPetersburg.",
      "As for the amusements of bachelor existence, which had\nprovided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad, they\ncould not be thought of, since the sole attempt of the sort had led to\na sudden attack of depression in Anna, quite out of proportion with the\ncause a late supper with bachelor friends.",
      "Relations with the society\nof the place foreign and Russian were equally out of the question owing\nto the irregularity of their position.",
      "The inspection of objects of\ninterest, apart from the fact that everything had been seen already,\nhad not for Vronsky, a Russian and a sensible man, the immense\nsignificance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit.",
      "And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get,\nhoping to find nourishment in it, Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched\nfirst at politics, then at new books, and then at pictures.",
      "As he had from a child a taste for painting, and as, not knowing what\nto spend his money on, he had begun collecting engravings, he came to a\nstop at painting, began to take interest in it, and concentrated upon\nit the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction.",
      "He had a ready appreciation of art, and probably, with a taste for\nimitating art, he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for\nan artist, and after hesitating for some time which style of painting\nto select religious, historical, realistic, or genre painting he set to\nwork to paint.",
      "He appreciated all kinds, and could have felt inspired\nby anyone of them; but he had no conception of the possibility of\nknowing nothing at all of any school of painting, and of being inspired\ndirectly by what is within the soul, without caring whether what is\npainted will belong to any recognized school.",
      "Since he knew nothing of\nthis, and drew his inspiration, not directly from life, but indirectly\nfrom life embodied in art, his inspiration came very quickly and\neasily, and as quickly and easily came his success in painting\nsomething very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to\nimitate.",
      "More than any other style he liked the French graceful and\neffective and in that style he began to paint Anna s portrait in\nItalian costume, and the portrait seemed to him, and to everyone who\nsaw it, extremely successful.",
      "Chapter 9\n\nThe old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes\non the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff\ncurtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open\nfireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with\npictures this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had\nmoved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was\nnot so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an\nenlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who\nhad renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the sake\nof the woman he loved.",
      "The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was\ncompletely successful, and having, through Golenishtchev, made\nacquaintance with a few interesting people, for a time he was\nsatisfied.",
      "He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an\nItalian professor of painting, and studied medi val Italian life.",
      "Medi val Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and\nflung a cloak over his shoulder in the medi val style, which, indeed,\nwas extremely becoming to him.",
      "Here we live, and know nothing of what s going on,  Vronsky said to\nGolenishtchev as he came to see him one morning.",
      "Have you seen\nMihailov s picture?",
      "he said, handing him a Russian gazette he had\nreceived that morning, and pointing to an article on a Russian artist,\nliving in the very same town, and just finishing a picture which had\nlong been talked about, and had been bought beforehand.",
      "The article\nreproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an\nartist be left without encouragement and support.",
      "I ve seen it,  answered Golenishtchev.",
      "Of course, he s not without\ntalent, but it s all in a wrong direction.",
      "It s all the\nIvanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting.",
      "What is the subject of the picture?",
      "asked Anna.",
      "Christ before Pilate.",
      "Christ is represented as a Jew with all the\nrealism of the new school.",
      "And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to\none of his favorite theories, Golenishtchev launched forth into a\ndisquisition on it.",
      "I can t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake.",
      "Christ\nalways has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters.",
      "And\ntherefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a revolutionist or a\nsage, let them take from history a Socrates, a Franklin, a Charlotte\nCorday, but not Christ.",
      "They take the very figure which cannot be taken\nfor their art, and then.... \n\n And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?",
      "asked Vronsky,\nthinking that, as a Russian M cenas, it was his duty to assist the\nartist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.",
      "I should say not.",
      "He s a remarkable portrait-painter.",
      "Have you ever\nseen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova?",
      "But I believe he doesn t\ncare about painting any more portraits, and so very likely he is in\nwant.",
      "I maintain that.... \n\n Couldn t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "said\nVronsky.",
      "Why mine?",
      "said Anna.",
      "After yours I don t want another portrait.",
      "Better have one of Annie  (so she called her baby girl).",
      "Here she is, \nshe added, looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse, who\nwas carrying the child out into the garden, and immediately glancing\nunnoticed at Vronsky.",
      "The handsome nurse, from whom Vronsky was\npainting a head for his picture, was the one hidden grief in Anna s\nlife.",
      "He painted with her as his model, admired her beauty and\nmedi valism, and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid\nof becoming jealous of this nurse, and was for that reason particularly\ngracious and condescending both to her and her little son.",
      "Vronsky,\ntoo, glanced out of the window and into Anna s eyes, and, turning at\nonce to Golenishtchev, he said:\n\n Do you know this Mihailov?",
      "I have met him.",
      "But he s a queer fish, and quite without breeding.",
      "You\nknow, one of those uncouth new people one s so often coming across\nnowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are reared\n_d embl e_ in theories of atheism, scepticism, and materialism.",
      "In\nformer days,  said Golenishtchev, not observing, or not willing to\nobserve, that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak,  in former days\nthe free-thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of\nreligion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle\ncame to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born\nfree-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of\nmorality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up\ndirectly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.",
      "Well, he s of that class.",
      "He s the son, it appears, of some Moscow\nbutler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up.",
      "When he got into the\nacademy and made his reputation he tried, as he s no fool, to educate\nhimself.",
      "And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of\nculture the magazines.",
      "In old times, you see, a man who wanted to\neducate himself a Frenchman, for instance would have set to work to\nstudy all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historians\nand philosophers, and, you know, all the intellectual work that came in\nhis way.",
      "But in our day he goes straight for the literature of\nnegation, very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of\nnegation, and he s ready.",
      "And that s not all twenty years ago he would\nhave found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with\nthe creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that\nthere was something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in\nwhich the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it\nis stated baldly that there is nothing else evolution, natural\nselection, struggle for existence and that s all.",
      "In my article\nI ve....",
      "I tell you what,  said Anna, who had for a long while been exchanging\nwary glances with Vronsky, and knew that he was not in the least\ninterested in the education of this artist, but was simply absorbed by\nthe idea of assisting him, and ordering a portrait of him;  I tell you\nwhat,  she said, resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev, who was still\ntalking away,  let s go and see him!",
      "Golenishtchev recovered his self-possession and readily agreed.",
      "But as\nthe artist lived in a remote suburb, it was decided to take the\ncarriage.",
      "An hour later Anna, with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the\nfront seat of the carriage, facing them, drove up to a new ugly house\nin the remote suburb.",
      "On learning from the porter s wife, who came out\nto them, that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio, but that at that\nmoment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off, they sent her\nto him with their cards, asking permission to see his picture.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nThe artist Mihailov was, as always, at work when the cards of Count\nVronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him.",
      "In the morning he had\nbeen working in his studio at his big picture.",
      "On getting home he flew\ninto a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the\nlandlady, who had been asking for money.",
      "I ve said it to you twenty times, don t enter into details.",
      "You re\nfool enough at all times, and when you start explaining things in\nItalian you re a fool three times as foolish,  he said after a long\ndispute.",
      "Don t let it run so long; it s not my fault.",
      "If I had the money.... \n\n Leave me in peace, for God s sake!",
      "Mihailov shrieked, with tears in\nhis voice, and, stopping his ears, he went off into his working room,\nthe other side of a partition wall, and closed the door after him.",
      "Idiotic woman!",
      "he said to himself, sat down to the table, and,\nopening a portfolio, he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a\nsketch he had begun.",
      "Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill\nwith him, and especially when he quarreled with his wife.",
      "Oh!",
      "damn\nthem all!",
      "he thought as he went on working.",
      "He was making a sketch for\nthe figure of a man in a violent rage.",
      "A sketch had been made before,\nbut he was dissatisfied with it.",
      "No, that one was better ... where is\nit?",
      "He went back to his wife, and scowling, and not looking at her,\nasked his eldest little girl, where was that piece of paper he had\ngiven them?",
      "The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found, but it\nwas dirty, and spotted with candle-grease.",
      "Still, he took the sketch,\nlaid it on his table, and, moving a little away, screwing up his eyes,\nhe fell to gazing at it.",
      "All at once he smiled and gesticulated\ngleefully.",
      "That s it!",
      "that s it!",
      "he said, and, at once picking up the pencil, he\nbegan rapidly drawing.",
      "The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose.",
      "He had sketched this new pose, when all at once he recalled the face of\na shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars, a vigorous face with a\nprominent chin, and he sketched this very face, this chin on to the\nfigure of the man.",
      "He laughed aloud with delight.",
      "The figure from a\nlifeless imagined thing had become living, and such that it could never\nbe changed.",
      "That figure lived, and was clearly and unmistakably\ndefined.",
      "The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the\nrequirements of the figure, the legs, indeed, could and must be put\ndifferently, and the position of the left hand must be quite altered;\nthe hair too might be thrown back.",
      "But in making these corrections he\nwas not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed\nthe figure.",
      "He was, as it were, stripping off the wrappings which\nhindered it from being distinctly seen.",
      "Each new feature only brought\nout the whole figure in all its force and vigor, as it had suddenly\ncome to him from the spot of tallow.",
      "He was carefully finishing the\nfigure when the cards were brought him.",
      "Coming, coming!",
      "He went in to his wife.",
      "Come, Sasha, don t be cross!",
      "he said, smiling timidly and\naffectionately at her.",
      "You were to blame.",
      "I was to blame.",
      "I ll make it\nall right.",
      "And having made peace with his wife he put on an\nolive-green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat, and went towards\nhis studio.",
      "The successful figure he had already forgotten.",
      "Now he was\ndelighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence,\nRussians, who had come in their carriage.",
      "Of his picture, the one that stood now on his easel, he had at the\nbottom of his heart one conviction that no one had ever painted a\npicture like it.",
      "He did not believe that his picture was better than\nall the pictures of Raphael, but he knew that what he tried to convey\nin that picture, no one ever had conveyed.",
      "This he knew positively, and\nhad known a long while, ever since he had begun to paint it.",
      "But other\npeople s criticisms, whatever they might be, had yet immense\nconsequence in his eyes, and they agitated him to the depths of his\nsoul.",
      "Any remark, the most insignificant, that showed that the critic\nsaw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture, agitated him\nto the depths of his soul.",
      "He always attributed to his critics a more\nprofound comprehension than he had himself, and always expected from\nthem something he did not himself see in the picture.",
      "And often in\ntheir criticisms he fancied that he had found this.",
      "He walked rapidly to the door of his studio, and in spite of his\nexcitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna s figure as she\nstood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev, who was\neagerly telling her something, while she evidently wanted to look round\nat the artist.",
      "He was himself unconscious how, as he approached them,\nhe seized on this impression and absorbed it, as he had the chin of the\nshopkeeper who had sold him the cigars, and put it away somewhere to be\nbrought out when he wanted it.",
      "The visitors, not agreeably impressed\nbeforehand by Golenishtchev s account of the artist, were still less so\nby his personal appearance.",
      "Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble\nmovements, with his brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow\ntrousers though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion, most of\nall, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined\nexpression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov\nmade an unpleasant impression.",
      "Please step in,  he said, trying to look indifferent, and going into\nthe passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nOn entering the studio, Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and\nnoted down in his imagination Vronsky s expression too, and especially\nhis jaws.",
      "Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work\ncollecting materials, although he felt a continually increasing\nexcitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer, he\nrapidly and subtly formed, from imperceptible signs, a mental image of\nthese three persons.",
      "That fellow (Golenishtchev) was a Russian living here.",
      "Mihailov did not\nremember his surname nor where he had met him, nor what he had said to\nhim.",
      "He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had\never seen; but he remembered, too, that it was one of the faces laid by\nin his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and\npoor in expression.",
      "The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an\nappearance of consequence to the face, which had only one expression a\npetty, childish, peevish expression, concentrated just above the bridge\nof the narrow nose.",
      "Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be, Mihailov\nsupposed, distinguished and wealthy Russians, knowing nothing about\nart, like all those wealthy Russians, but posing as amateurs and\nconnoisseurs.",
      "Most likely they ve already looked at all the antiques,\nand now they re making the round of the studios of the new people, the\nGerman humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have\nonly come to me to make the point of view complete,  he thought.",
      "He was\nwell acquainted with the way dilettanti have (the cleverer they were\nthe worse he found them) of looking at the works of contemporary\nartists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is\na thing of the past, and that the more one sees of the new men the more\none sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have\nremained.",
      "He expected all this; he saw it all in their faces, he saw it\nin the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves,\nstared at the lay figures and busts, and walked about in leisurely\nfashion, waiting for him to uncover his picture.",
      "But in spite of this,\nwhile he was turning over his studies, pulling up the blinds and taking\noff the sheet, he was in intense excitement, especially as, in spite of\nhis conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain\nto be beasts and fools, he liked Vronsky, and still more Anna.",
      "Here, if you please,  he said, moving on one side with his nimble gait\nand pointing to his picture,  it s the exhortation to Pilate.",
      "Matthew,\nchapter xxvii,  he said, feeling his lips were beginning to tremble\nwith emotion.",
      "He moved away and stood behind them.",
      "For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the\npicture in silence Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of\nan outsider.",
      "For those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a\nhigher, juster criticism would be uttered by them, by those very\nvisitors whom he had been so despising a moment before.",
      "He forgot all\nhe had thought about his picture before during the three years he had\nbeen painting it; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely\ncertain to him he saw the picture with their indifferent, new, outside\neyes, and saw nothing good in it.",
      "He saw in the foreground Pilate s\nirritated face and the serene face of Christ, and in the background the\nfigures of Pilate s retinue and the face of John watching what was\nhappening.",
      "Every face that, with such agony, such blunders and\ncorrections had grown up within him with its special character, every\nface that had given him such torments and such raptures, and all these\nfaces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the\nwhole, all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such\nlabor all of this together seemed to him now, looking at it with their\neyes, the merest vulgarity, something that had been done a thousand\ntimes over.",
      "The face dearest to him, the face of Christ, the center of\nthe picture, which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to\nhim, was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their\neyes.",
      "He saw a well-painted (no, not even that he distinctly saw now a\nmass of defects) repetition of those endless Christs of Titian,\nRaphael, Rubens, and the same soldiers and Pilate.",
      "It was all common,\npoor, and stale, and positively badly painted weak and unequal.",
      "They\nwould be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the\npresence of the painter, and pitying him and laughing at him when they\nwere alone again.",
      "The silence (though it lasted no more than a minute) became too\nintolerable to him.",
      "To break it, and to show he was not agitated, he\nmade an effort and addressed Golenishtchev.",
      "I think I ve had the pleasure of meeting you,  he said, looking\nuneasily first at Anna, then at Vronsky, in fear of losing any shade of\ntheir expression.",
      "To be sure!",
      "We met at Rossi s, do you remember, at that _soir e_ when\nthat Italian lady recited the new Rachel?",
      "Golenishtchev answered\neasily, removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture\nand turning to the artist.",
      "Noticing, however, that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the\npicture, he said:\n\n Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and\nwhat strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of\nPilate.",
      "One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an\nofficial through and through, who does not know what it is he s doing.",
      "But I fancy.... \n\nAll Mihailov s mobile face beamed at once; his eyes sparkled.",
      "He tried\nto say something, but he could not speak for excitement, and pretended\nto be coughing.",
      "Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev s capacity for\nunderstanding art, trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of\nthe expression of Pilate as an official, and offensive as might have\nseemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was\nsaid of more serious points, Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at\nthis observation.",
      "He had himself thought about Pilate s figure just\nwhat Golenishtchev said.",
      "The fact that this reflection was but one of\nmillions of reflections, which as Mihailov knew for certain would be\ntrue, did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev s\nremark.",
      "His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark, and from a\nstate of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy.",
      "At once the whole of\nhis picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of\neverything living.",
      "Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he\nunderstood Pilate, but his lips quivered intractably, and he could not\npronounce the words.",
      "Vronsky and Anna too said something in that\nsubdued voice in which, partly to avoid hurting the artist s feelings\nand partly to avoid saying out loud something silly so easily said when\ntalking of art people usually speak at exhibitions of pictures.",
      "Mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too.",
      "He went up to them.",
      "How marvelous Christ s expression is!",
      "said Anna.",
      "Of all she saw she\nliked that expression most of all, and she felt that it was the center\nof the picture, and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist.",
      "One can see that He is pitying Pilate.",
      "This again was one of the million true reflections that could be found\nin his picture and in the figure of Christ.",
      "She said that He was\npitying Pilate.",
      "In Christ s expression there ought to be indeed an\nexpression of pity, since there is an expression of love, of heavenly\npeace, of readiness for death, and a sense of the vanity of words.",
      "Of\ncourse there is the expression of an official in Pilate and of pity in\nChrist, seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other\nof the spiritual life.",
      "All this and much more flashed into Mihailov s\nthoughts.",
      "Yes, and how that figure is done what atmosphere!",
      "One can walk round\nit,  said Golenishtchev, unmistakably betraying by this remark that he\ndid not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure.",
      "Yes, there s a wonderful mastery!",
      "said Vronsky.",
      "How those figures in\nthe background stand out!",
      "There you have technique,  he said,\naddressing Golenishtchev, alluding to a conversation between them about\nVronsky s despair of attaining this technique.",
      "Yes, yes, marvelous!",
      "Golenishtchev and Anna assented.",
      "In spite of the\nexcited condition in which he was, the sentence about technique had\nsent a pang to Mihailov s heart, and looking angrily at Vronsky he\nsuddenly scowled.",
      "He had often heard this word technique, and was\nutterly unable to understand what was understood by it.",
      "He knew that by\nthis term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing,\nentirely apart from its subject.",
      "He had noticed often that even in\nactual praise technique was opposed to essential quality, as though one\ncould paint well something that was bad.",
      "He knew that a great deal of\nattention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings, to avoid\ninjuring the creation itself, and to take off all the coverings; but\nthere was no art of painting no technique of any sort about it.",
      "If to a\nlittle child or to his cook were revealed what he saw, it or she would\nhave been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen.",
      "And the most\nexperienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility\npaint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him\nfirst.",
      "Besides, he saw that if it came to talking about technique, it\nwas impossible to praise him for it.",
      "In all he had painted and\nrepainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes, coming from want of care in\ntaking off the wrappings faults he could not correct now without\nspoiling the whole.",
      "And in almost all the figures and faces he saw,\ntoo, remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the\npicture.",
      "One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark.... \nobserved Golenishtchev.",
      "Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,  said Mihailov with a forced\nsmile.",
      "That is, that you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man.",
      "But I\nknow that was what you meant to do.",
      "I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,  said Mihailov\ngloomily.",
      "Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....",
      "Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it,\nand, besides, it is only my personal opinion.",
      "With you it is different.",
      "Your very motive is different.",
      "But let us take Ivanov.",
      "I imagine that\nif Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character, it\nwould have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical\nsubject, fresh, untouched.",
      "But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?",
      "If one looked one would find others.",
      "But the point is that art cannot\nsuffer doubt and discussion.",
      "And before the picture of Ivanov the\nquestion arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike,  Is it God,\nor is it not God?",
      "and the unity of the impression is destroyed.",
      "Why so?",
      "I think that for educated people,  said Mihailov,  the\nquestion cannot exist.",
      "Golenishtchev did not agree with this, and confounded Mihailov by his\nsupport of his first idea of the unity of the impression being\nessential to art.",
      "Mihailov was greatly perturbed, but he could say nothing in defense of\nhis own idea.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nAnna and Vronsky had long been exchanging glances, regretting their\nfriend s flow of cleverness.",
      "At last Vronsky, without waiting for the\nartist, walked away to another small picture.",
      "Oh, how exquisite!",
      "What a lovely thing!",
      "A gem!",
      "How exquisite!",
      "they\ncried with one voice.",
      "What is it they re so pleased with?",
      "thought Mihailov.",
      "He had\npositively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago.",
      "He\nhad forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through\nwith that picture when for several months it had been the one thought\nhaunting him day and night.",
      "He had forgotten, as he always forgot, the\npictures he had finished.",
      "He did not even like to look at it, and had\nonly brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wanted\nto buy it.",
      "Oh, that s only an old study,  he said.",
      "How fine!",
      "said Golenishtchev, he too, with unmistakable sincerity,\nfalling under the spell of the picture.",
      "Two boys were angling in the shade of a willow-tree.",
      "The elder had just\ndropped in the hook, and was carefully pulling the float from behind a\nbush, entirely absorbed in what he was doing.",
      "The other, a little\nyounger, was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows, with his\ntangled, flaxen head in his hands, staring at the water with his dreamy\nblue eyes.",
      "What was he thinking of?",
      "The enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it\nin Mihailov, but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for\nthings past, and so, even though this praise was grateful to him, he\ntried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.",
      "But Vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale.",
      "To Mihailov at that\nmoment, excited by visitors, it was extremely distasteful to speak of\nmoney matters.",
      "It is put up there to be sold,  he answered, scowling gloomily.",
      "When the visitors had gone, Mihailov sat down opposite the picture of\nPilate and Christ, and in his mind went over what had been said, and\nwhat, though not said, had been implied by those visitors.",
      "And, strange\nto say, what had had such weight with him, while they were there and\nwhile he mentally put himself at their point of view, suddenly lost all\nimportance for him.",
      "He began to look at his picture with all his own\nfull artist vision, and was soon in that mood of conviction of the\nperfectibility, and so of the significance, of his picture a conviction\nessential to the most intense fervor, excluding all other interests in\nwhich alone he could work.",
      "Christ s foreshortened leg was not right, though.",
      "He took his palette\nand began to work.",
      "As he corrected the leg he looked continually at the\nfigure of John in the background, which his visitors had not even\nnoticed, but which he knew was beyond perfection.",
      "When he had finished\nthe leg he wanted to touch that figure, but he felt too much excited\nfor it.",
      "He was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was\ntoo much affected and saw everything too much.",
      "There was only one stage\nin the transition from coldness to inspiration, at which work was\npossible.",
      "Today he was too much agitated.",
      "He would have covered the\npicture, but he stopped, holding the cloth in his hand, and, smiling\nblissfully, gazed a long while at the figure of John.",
      "At last, as it\nwere regretfully tearing himself away, he dropped the cloth, and,\nexhausted but happy, went home.",
      "Vronsky, Anna, and Golenishtchev, on their way home, were particularly\nlively and cheerful.",
      "They talked of Mihailov and his pictures.",
      "The word\n_talent_, by which they meant an inborn, almost physical, aptitude\napart from brain and heart, and in which they tried to find an\nexpression for all the artist had gained from life, recurred\nparticularly often in their talk, as though it were necessary for them\nto sum up what they had no conception of, though they wanted to talk of\nit.",
      "They said that there was no denying his talent, but that his talent\ncould not develop for want of education the common defect of our\nRussian artists.",
      "But the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on\ntheir memories, and they were continually coming back to it.",
      "What an\nexquisite thing!",
      "How he has succeeded in it, and how simply!",
      "He doesn t\neven comprehend how good it is.",
      "Yes, I mustn t let it slip; I must buy\nit,  said Vronsky.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nMihailov sold Vronsky his picture, and agreed to paint a portrait of\nAnna.",
      "On the day fixed he came and began the work.",
      "From the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone, especially\nVronsky, not only by its resemblance, but by its characteristic beauty.",
      "It was strange how Mihailov could have discovered just her\ncharacteristic beauty.",
      "One needs to know and love her as I have loved\nher to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul,  Vronsky\nthought, though it was only from this portrait that he had himself\nlearned this sweetest expression of her soul.",
      "But the expression was so\ntrue that he, and others too, fancied they had long known it.",
      "I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything,  he\nsaid of his own portrait of her,  and he just looked and painted it.",
      "That s where technique comes in.",
      "That will come,  was the consoling reassurance given him by\nGolenishtchev, in whose view Vronsky had both talent, and what was most\nimportant, culture, giving him a wider outlook on art.",
      "Golenishtchev s\nfaith in Vronsky s talent was propped up by his own need of Vronsky s\nsympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas, and he felt that\nthe praise and support must be mutual.",
      "In another man s house, and especially in Vronsky s palazzo, Mihailov\nwas quite a different man from what he was in his studio.",
      "He behaved\nwith hostile courtesy, as though he were afraid of coming closer to\npeople he did not respect.",
      "He called Vronsky  your excellency,  and\nnotwithstanding Anna s and Vronsky s invitations, he would never stay\nto dinner, nor come except for the sittings.",
      "Anna was even more\nfriendly to him than to other people, and was very grateful for her\nportrait.",
      "Vronsky was more than cordial with him, and was obviously\ninterested to know the artist s opinion of his picture.",
      "Golenishtchev\nnever let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into\nMihailov.",
      "But Mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them.",
      "Anna was\naware from his eyes that he liked looking at her, but he avoided\nconversation with her.",
      "Vronsky s talk about his painting he met with\nstubborn silence, and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown\nVronsky s picture.",
      "He was unmistakably bored by Golenishtchev s\nconversation, and he did not attempt to oppose him.",
      "Altogether Mihailov, with his reserved and disagreeable, as it were,\nhostile attitude, was quite disliked by them as they got to know him\nbetter; and they were glad when the sittings were over, and they were\nleft with a magnificent portrait in their possession, and he gave up\ncoming.",
      "Golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that\nhad occurred to all of them, which was that Mihailov was simply jealous\nof Vronsky.",
      "Not envious, let us say, since he has _talent_; but it annoys him that\na wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you know they\nall detest a title), can, without any particular trouble, do as well,\nif not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it.",
      "And more\nthan all, it s a question of culture, which he is without.",
      "Vronsky defended Mihailov, but at the bottom of his heart he believed\nit, because in his view a man of a different, lower world would be sure\nto be envious.",
      "Anna s portrait the same subject painted from nature both by him and by\nMihailov ought to have shown Vronsky the difference between him and\nMihailov; but he did not see it.",
      "Only after Mihailov s portrait was\npainted he left off painting his portrait of Anna, deciding that it was\nnow not needed.",
      "His picture of medi val life he went on with.",
      "And he\nhimself, and Golenishtchev, and still more Anna, thought it very good,\nbecause it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than\nMihailov s picture.",
      "Mihailov meanwhile, although Anna s portrait greatly fascinated him,\nwas even more glad than they were when the sittings were over, and he\nhad no longer to listen to Golenishtchev s disquisitions upon art, and\ncould forget about Vronsky s painting.",
      "He knew that Vronsky could not\nbe prevented from amusing himself with painting; he knew that he and\nall dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked, but it was\ndistasteful to him.",
      "A man could not be prevented from making himself a\nbig wax doll, and kissing it.",
      "But if the man were to come with the doll\nand sit before a man in love, and begin caressing his doll as the lover\ncaressed the woman he loved, it would be distasteful to the lover.",
      "Just\nsuch a distasteful sensation was what Mihailov felt at the sight of\nVronsky s painting: he felt it both ludicrous and irritating, both\npitiable and offensive.",
      "Vronsky s interest in painting and the Middle Ages did not last long.",
      "He had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture.",
      "The picture came to a standstill.",
      "He was vaguely aware that its\ndefects, inconspicuous at first, would be glaring if he were to go on\nwith it.",
      "The same experience befell him as Golenishtchev, who felt that\nhe had nothing to say, and continually deceived himself with the theory\nthat his idea was not yet mature, that he was working it out and\ncollecting materials.",
      "This exasperated and tortured Golenishtchev, but\nVronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself, and even more\nincapable of exasperation.",
      "With his characteristic decision, without\nexplanation or apology, he simply ceased working at painting.",
      "But without this occupation, the life of Vronsky and of Anna, who\nwondered at his loss of interest in it, struck them as intolerably\ntedious in an Italian town.",
      "The palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively\nold and dirty, the spots on the curtains, the cracks in the floors, the\nbroken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious, and the\neverlasting sameness of Golenishtchev, and the Italian professor and\nthe German traveler became so wearisome, that they had to make some\nchange.",
      "They resolved to go to Russia, to the country.",
      "In Petersburg\nVronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother,\nwhile Anna meant to see her son.",
      "The summer they intended to spend on\nVronsky s great family estate.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nLevin had been married three months.",
      "He was happy, but not at all in\nthe way he had expected to be.",
      "At every step he found his former dreams\ndisappointed, and new, unexpected surprises of happiness.",
      "He was happy;\nbut on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was\nutterly different from what he had imagined.",
      "At every step he\nexperienced what a man would experience who, after admiring the smooth,\nhappy course of a little boat on a lake, should get himself into that\nlittle boat.",
      "He saw that it was not all sitting still, floating\nsmoothly; that one had to think too, not for an instant to forget where\none was floating; and that there was water under one, and that one must\nrow; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore; and that it was\nonly to look at it that was easy; but that doing it, though very\ndelightful, was very difficult.",
      "As a bachelor, when he had watched other people s married life, seen\nthe petty cares, the squabbles, the jealousy, he had only smiled\ncontemptuously in his heart.",
      "In his future married life there could be,\nhe was convinced, nothing of that sort; even the external forms,\nindeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in\neverything.",
      "And all of a sudden, instead of his life with his wife\nbeing made on an individual pattern, it was, on the contrary, entirely\nmade up of the pettiest details, which he had so despised before, but\nwhich now, by no will of his own, had gained an extraordinary\nimportance that it was useless to contend against.",
      "And Levin saw that\nthe organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had\nfancied before.",
      "Although Levin believed himself to have the most exact\nconceptions of domestic life, unconsciously, like all men, he pictured\ndomestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love, with nothing to hinder\nand no petty cares to distract.",
      "He ought, as he conceived the position,\nto do his work, and to find repose from it in the happiness of love.",
      "She ought to be beloved, and nothing more.",
      "But, like all men, he forgot\nthat she too would want work.",
      "And he was surprised that she, his\npoetic, exquisite Kitty, could, not merely in the first weeks, but even\nin the first days of their married life, think, remember, and busy\nherself about tablecloths, and furniture, about mattresses for\nvisitors, about a tray, about the cook, and the dinner, and so on.",
      "While they were still engaged, he had been struck by the definiteness\nwith which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the\ncountry, as though she knew of something she wanted, and could still\nthink of something outside her love.",
      "This had jarred upon him then, and\nnow her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times.",
      "But\nhe saw that this was essential for her.",
      "And, loving her as he did,\nthough he did not understand the reason of them, and jeered at these\ndomestic pursuits, he could not help admiring them.",
      "He jeered at the\nway in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from Moscow;\nrearranged their room; hung up curtains; prepared rooms for visitors; a\nroom for Dolly; saw after an abode for her new maid; ordered dinner of\nthe old cook; came into collision with Agafea Mihalovna, taking from\nher the charge of the stores.",
      "He saw how the old cook smiled, admiring\nher, and listening to her inexperienced, impossible orders, how\nmournfully and tenderly Agafea Mihalovna shook her head over the young\nmistress s new arrangements.",
      "He saw that Kitty was extraordinarily\nsweet when, laughing and crying, she came to tell him that her maid,\nMasha, was used to looking upon her as her young lady, and so no one\nobeyed her.",
      "It seemed to him sweet, but strange, and he thought it\nwould have been better without this.",
      "He did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing; she,\nwho at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish, or sweets, without\nthe possibility of getting either, now could order what she liked, buy\npounds of sweets, spend as much money as she liked, and order any\npuddings she pleased.",
      "She was dreaming with delight now of Dolly s coming to them with her\nchildren, especially because she would order for the children their\nfavorite puddings and Dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping.",
      "She did not know herself why and wherefore, but the arranging of her\nhouse had an irresistible attraction for her.",
      "Instinctively feeling the\napproach of spring, and knowing that there would be days of rough\nweather too, she built her nest as best she could, and was in haste at\nthe same time to build it and to learn how to do it.",
      "This care for domestic details in Kitty, so opposed to Levin s ideal of\nexalted happiness, was at first one of the disappointments; and this\nsweet care of her household, the aim of which he did not understand,\nbut could not help loving, was one of the new happy surprises.",
      "Another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels.",
      "Levin\ncould never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations\ncould arise other than tender, respectful and loving, and all at once\nin the very early days they quarreled, so that she said he did not care\nfor her, that he cared for no one but himself, burst into tears, and\nwrung her arms.",
      "This first quarrel arose from Levin s having gone out to a new\nfarmhouse and having been away half an hour too long, because he had\ntried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way.",
      "He drove home\nthinking of nothing but her, of her love, of his own happiness, and the\nnearer he drew to home, the warmer was his tenderness for her.",
      "He ran\ninto the room with the same feeling, with an even stronger feeling than\nhe had had when he reached the Shtcherbatskys  house to make his offer.",
      "And suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in\nher.",
      "He would have kissed her; she pushed him away.",
      "What is it?",
      "You ve been enjoying yourself,  she began, trying to be calm and\nspiteful.",
      "But as soon as she opened her mouth, a stream of reproach, of\nsenseless jealousy, of all that had been torturing her during that half\nhour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window, burst from\nher.",
      "It was only then, for the first time, that he clearly understood\nwhat he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the\nwedding.",
      "He felt now that he was not simply close to her, but that he\ndid not know where he ended and she began.",
      "He felt this from the\nagonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant.",
      "He\nwas offended for the first instant, but the very same second he felt\nthat he could not be offended by her, that she was himself.",
      "He felt for\nthe first moment as a man feels when, having suddenly received a\nviolent blow from behind, he turns round, angry and eager to avenge\nhimself, to look for his antagonist, and finds that it is he himself\nwho has accidentally struck himself, that there is no one to be angry\nwith, and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain.",
      "Never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity, but this first\ntime he could not for a long while get over it.",
      "His natural feeling\nurged him to defend himself, to prove to her she was wrong; but to\nprove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the\nrupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering.",
      "One habitual\nfeeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her.",
      "Another feeling, even stronger, impelled him as quickly as possible to\nsmooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater.",
      "To remain\nunder such undeserved reproach was wretched, but to make her suffer by\njustifying himself was worse still.",
      "Like a man half-awake in an agony\nof pain, he wanted to tear out, to fling away the aching place, and\ncoming to his senses, he felt that the aching place was himself.",
      "He\ncould do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it, and this\nhe tried to do.",
      "They made peace.",
      "She, recognizing that she was wrong, though she did\nnot say so, became tenderer to him, and they experienced new, redoubled\nhappiness in their love.",
      "But that did not prevent such quarrels from\nhappening again, and exceedingly often too, on the most unexpected and\ntrivial grounds.",
      "These quarrels frequently arose from the fact that\nthey did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all\nthis early period they were both often in a bad temper.",
      "When one was in\na good temper, and the other in a bad temper, the peace was not broken;\nbut when both happened to be in an ill-humor, quarrels sprang up from\nsuch incomprehensibly trifling causes, that they could never remember\nafterwards what they had quarreled about.",
      "It is true that when they\nwere both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled.",
      "But\nstill this first period of their married life was a difficult time for\nthem.",
      "During all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of\ntension, as it were, a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by\nwhich they were bound.",
      "Altogether their honeymoon that is to say, the\nmonth after their wedding from which from tradition Levin expected so\nmuch, was not merely not a time of sweetness, but remained in the\nmemories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their\nlives.",
      "They both alike tried in later life to blot out from their\nmemories all the monstrous, shameful incidents of that morbid period,\nwhen both were rarely in a normal frame of mind, both were rarely quite\nthemselves.",
      "It was only in the third month of their married life, after their\nreturn from Moscow, where they had been staying for a month, that their\nlife began to go more smoothly.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nThey had just come back from Moscow, and were glad to be alone.",
      "He was\nsitting at the writing-table in his study, writing.",
      "She, wearing the\ndark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married\nlife, and put on again today, a dress particularly remembered and loved\nby him, was sitting on the sofa, the same old-fashioned leather sofa\nwhich had always stood in the study in Levin s father s and\ngrandfather s days.",
      "She was sewing at _broderie anglaise_.",
      "He thought\nand wrote, never losing the happy consciousness of her presence.",
      "His\nwork, both on the land and on the book, in which the principles of the\nnew land system were to be laid down, had not been abandoned; but just\nas formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and\ntrivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life, now\nthey seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that\nlay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness.",
      "He went\non with his work, but he felt now that the center of gravity of his\nattention had passed to something else, and that consequently he looked\nat his work quite differently and more clearly.",
      "Formerly this work had\nbeen for him an escape from life.",
      "Formerly he had felt that without\nthis work his life would be too gloomy.",
      "Now these pursuits were\nnecessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright.",
      "Taking\nup his manuscript, reading through what he had written, he found with\npleasure that the work was worth his working at.",
      "Many of his old ideas\nseemed to him superfluous and extreme, but many blanks became distinct\nto him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory.",
      "He was writing\nnow a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of\nagriculture in Russia.",
      "He maintained that the poverty of Russia arises\nnot merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and\nmisdirected reforms, but that what had contributed of late years to\nthis result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon\nRussia, especially facilities of communication, as railways, leading to\ncentralization in towns, the development of luxury, and the consequent\ndevelopment of manufactures, credit and its accompaniment of\nspeculation all to the detriment of agriculture.",
      "It seemed to him that\nin a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would\narise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into\nagriculture, when it had come under regular, or at least definite,\nconditions; that the wealth of a country ought to increase\nproportionally, and especially in such a way that other sources of\nwealth should not outstrip agriculture; that in harmony with a certain\nstage of agriculture there should be means of communication\ncorresponding to it, and that in our unsettled condition of the land,\nrailways, called into being by political and not by economic needs,\nwere premature, and instead of promoting agriculture, as was expected\nof them, they were competing with agriculture and promoting the\ndevelopment of manufactures and credit, and so arresting its progress;\nand that just as the one-sided and premature development of one organ\nin an animal would hinder its general development, so in the general\ndevelopment of wealth in Russia, credit, facilities of communication,\nmanufacturing activity, indubitably necessary in Europe, where they had\narisen in their proper time, had with us only done harm, by throwing\ninto the background the chief question calling for settlement the\nquestion of the organization of agriculture.",
      "While he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial\nher husband had been to young Prince Tcharsky, who had, with great want\nof tact, flirted with her the day before they left Moscow.",
      "He s\njealous,  she thought.",
      "Goodness!",
      "how sweet and silly he is!",
      "He s\njealous of me!",
      "If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr\nthe cook,  she thought, looking at his head and red neck with a feeling\nof possession strange to herself.",
      "Though it s a pity to take him from\nhis work (but he has plenty of time!",
      "), I must look at his face; will he\nfeel I m looking at him?",
      "I wish he d turn round ...",
      "I ll _will_ him\nto!",
      "and she opened her eyes wide, as though to intensify the influence\nof her gaze.",
      "Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of\nprosperity,  he muttered, stopping to write, and, feeling that she was\nlooking at him and smiling, he looked round.",
      "Well?",
      "he queried, smiling, and getting up.",
      "He looked round,  she thought.",
      "It s nothing; I wanted you to look round,  she said, watching him, and\ntrying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not.",
      "How happy we are alone together!",
      "I am, that is,  he said, going up to\nher with a radiant smile of happiness.",
      "I m just as happy.",
      "I ll never go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.",
      "And what were you thinking about?",
      "I?",
      "I was thinking.... No, no, go along, go on writing; don t break\noff,  she said, pursing up her lips,  and I must cut out these little\nholes now, do you see?",
      "She took up her scissors and began cutting them out.",
      "No; tell me, what was it?",
      "he said, sitting down beside her and\nwatching the tiny scissors moving round.",
      "Oh!",
      "what was I thinking about?",
      "I was thinking about Moscow, about the\nback of your head.",
      "Why should I, of all people, have such happiness!",
      "It s unnatural, too\ngood,  he said, kissing her hand.",
      "I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more natural it\nseems to me.",
      "And you ve got a little curl loose,  he said, carefully turning her\nhead round.",
      "A little curl, oh yes.",
      "No, no, we are busy at our work!",
      "Work did not progress further, and they darted apart from one another\nlike culprits when Kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready.",
      "Have they come from the town?",
      "Levin asked Kouzma.",
      "They ve just come; they re unpacking the things.",
      "Come quickly,  she said to him as she went out of the study,  or else\nI shall read your letters without you.",
      "Left alone, after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio\nbought by her, he washed his hands at the new washstand with the\nelegant fittings, that had all made their appearance with her.",
      "Levin\nsmiled at his own thoughts, and shook his head disapprovingly at those\nthoughts; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him.",
      "There was something\nshameful, effeminate, Capuan, as he called it to himself, in his\npresent mode of life.",
      "It s not right to go on like this,  he thought.",
      "It ll soon be three months, and I m doing next to nothing.",
      "Today,\nalmost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?",
      "I did nothing but begin and throw it aside.",
      "Even my ordinary pursuits I\nhave almost given up.",
      "On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all\nto look after things.",
      "Either I am loath to leave her, or I see she s\ndull alone.",
      "And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing\nmuch, somehow didn t count, but that after marriage, life began in\nearnest.",
      "And here almost three months have passed, and I have spent my\ntime so idly and unprofitably.",
      "No, this won t do; I must begin.",
      "Of\ncourse, it s not her fault.",
      "She s not to blame in any way.",
      "I ought\nmyself to be firmer, to maintain my masculine independence of action;\nor else I shall get into such ways, and she ll get used to them too....\nOf course she s not to blame,  he told himself.",
      "But it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone\nelse, and especially the person nearest of all to him, for the ground\nof his dissatisfaction.",
      "And it vaguely came into Levin s mind that she\nherself was not to blame (she could not be to blame for anything), but\nwhat was to blame was her education, too superficial and frivolous.",
      "( That fool Tcharsky: she wanted, I know, to stop him, but didn t know\nhow to. )",
      "Yes, apart from her interest in the house (that she has),\napart from dress and _broderie anglaise_, she has no serious interests.",
      "No interest in her work, in the estate, in the peasants, nor in music,\nthough she s rather good at it, nor in reading.",
      "She does nothing, and\nis perfectly satisfied.",
      "Levin, in his heart, censured this, and did\nnot as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of\nactivity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife\nof her husband and mistress of the house, and would bear, and nurse,\nand bring up children.",
      "He knew not that she was instinctively aware of\nthis, and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil, did not\nreproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her\nlove that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nWhen Levin went upstairs, his wife was sitting near the new silver\nsamovar behind the new tea service, and, having settled old Agafea\nMihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea, was reading a\nletter from Dolly, with whom they were in continual and frequent\ncorrespondence.",
      "You see, your good lady s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with\nher,  said Agafea Mihalovna, smiling affectionately at Kitty.",
      "In these words of Agafea Mihalovna, Levin read the final act of the\ndrama which had been enacted of late between her and Kitty.",
      "He saw\nthat, in spite of Agafea Mihalovna s feelings being hurt by a new\nmistress taking the reins of government out of her hands, Kitty had yet\nconquered her and made her love her.",
      "Here, I opened your letter too,  said Kitty, handing him an illiterate\nletter.",
      "It s from that woman, I think, your brother s....  she said.",
      "I did not read it through.",
      "This is from my people and from Dolly.",
      "Fancy!",
      "Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children s ball at the\nSarmatskys : Tanya was a French marquise.",
      "But Levin did not hear her.",
      "Flushing, he took the letter from Marya\nNikolaevna, his brother s former mistress, and began to read it.",
      "This\nwas the second letter he had received from Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "In the\nfirst letter, Marya Nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away\nfor no fault of hers, and, with touching simplicity, added that though\nshe was in want again, she asked for nothing, and wished for nothing,\nbut was only tormented by the thought that Nikolay Dmitrievitch would\ncome to grief without her, owing to the weak state of his health, and\nbegged his brother to look after him.",
      "Now she wrote quite differently.",
      "She had found Nikolay Dmitrievitch, had again made it up with him in\nMoscow, and had moved with him to a provincial town, where he had\nreceived a post in the government service.",
      "But that he had quarreled\nwith the head official, and was on his way back to Moscow, only he had\nbeen taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever\nleave his bed again, she wrote.",
      "It s always of you he has talked, and,\nbesides, he has no more money left.",
      "Read this; Dolly writes about you,  Kitty was beginning, with a smile;\nbut she stopped suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her\nhusband s face.",
      "What is it?",
      "What s the matter?",
      "She writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death s door.",
      "I shall\ngo to him.",
      "Kitty s face changed at once.",
      "Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise, of\nDolly, all had vanished.",
      "When are you going?",
      "she said.",
      "Tomorrow.",
      "And I will go with you, can I?",
      "she said.",
      "Kitty!",
      "What are you thinking of?",
      "he said reproachfully.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "offended that he should seem to take her suggestion\nunwillingly and with vexation.",
      "Why shouldn t I go?",
      "I shan t be in your\nway.",
      "I....",
      "I m going because my brother is dying,  said Levin.",
      "Why should\nyou.... \n\n Why?",
      "For the same reason as you.",
      "And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her being\ndull by herself,  thought Levin.",
      "And this lack of candor in a matter of\nsuch gravity infuriated him.",
      "It s out of the question,  he said sternly.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, seeing that it was coming to a quarrel, gently put\ndown her cup and withdrew.",
      "Kitty did not even notice her.",
      "The tone in\nwhich her husband had said the last words wounded her, especially\nbecause he evidently did not believe what she had said.",
      "I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly\ncome,  she said hastily and wrathfully.",
      "Why out of the question?",
      "Why\ndo you say it s out of the question?",
      "Because it ll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads and to\nall sorts of hotels.",
      "You would be a hindrance to me,  said Levin,\ntrying to be cool.",
      "Not at all.",
      "I don t want anything.",
      "Where you can go, I can.... \n\n Well, for one thing then, because this woman s there whom you can t\nmeet.",
      "I don t know and don t care to know who s there and what.",
      "I know that\nmy husband s brother is dying and my husband is going to him, and I go\nwith my husband too.... \n\n Kitty!",
      "Don t get angry.",
      "But just think a little: this is a matter of\nsuch importance that I can t bear to think that you should bring in a\nfeeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone.",
      "Come, you ll be\ndull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a little.",
      "There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,  she said with\ntears of wounded pride and fury.",
      "I didn t mean, it wasn t weakness, it\nwasn t ...",
      "I feel that it s my duty to be with my husband when he s in\ntrouble, but you try on purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to\nunderstand.... \n\n No; this is awful!",
      "To be such a slave!",
      "cried Levin, getting up, and\nunable to restrain his anger any longer.",
      "But at the same second he felt\nthat he was beating himself.",
      "Then why did you marry?",
      "You could have been free.",
      "Why did you, if you\nregret it?",
      "she said, getting up and running away into the\ndrawing-room.",
      "When he went to her, she was sobbing.",
      "He began to speak, trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to\nsoothe her.",
      "But she did not heed him, and would not agree to anything.",
      "He bent down to her and took her hand, which resisted him.",
      "He kissed\nher hand, kissed her hair, kissed her hand again still she was silent.",
      "But when he took her face in both his hands and said  Kitty!",
      "she\nsuddenly recovered herself, and began to cry, and they were reconciled.",
      "It was decided that they should go together the next day.",
      "Levin told\nhis wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of\nuse, agreed that Marya Nikolaevna s being with his brother did not make\nher going improper, but he set off at the bottom of his heart\ndissatisfied both with her and with himself.",
      "He was dissatisfied with\nher for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was\nnecessary (and how strange it was for him to think that he, so lately\nhardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love\nhim now was unhappy because she loved him too much!",
      "), and he was\ndissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will.",
      "Even\ngreater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as\nto her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother, and\nhe thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with.",
      "The mere idea of his wife, his Kitty, being in the same room with a\ncommon wench, set him shuddering with horror and loathing.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nThe hotel of the provincial town where Nikolay Levin was lying ill was\none of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest\nmodel of modern improvements, with the best intentions of cleanliness,\ncomfort, and even elegance, but owing to the public that patronizes\nthem, are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with\na pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the\nold-fashioned, honestly filthy hotels.",
      "This hotel had already reached\nthat stage, and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry,\nsupposed to stand for a hall-porter, and the cast-iron, slippery, dark,\nand disagreeable staircase, and the free and easy waiter in a filthy\nfrock coat, and the common dining-room with a dusty bouquet of wax\nflowers adorning the table, and filth, dust, and disorder everywhere,\nand at the same time the sort of modern up-to-date self-complacent\nrailway uneasiness of this hotel, aroused a most painful feeling in\nLevin after their fresh young life, especially because the impression\nof falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited\nthem.",
      "As is invariably the case, after they had been asked at what price they\nwanted rooms, it appeared that there was not one decent room for them;\none decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads, another\nby a lawyer from Moscow, a third by Princess Astafieva from the\ncountry.",
      "There remained only one filthy room, next to which they\npromised that another should be empty by the evening.",
      "Feeling angry\nwith his wife because what he had expected had come to pass, which was\nthat at the moment of arrival, when his heart throbbed with emotion and\nanxiety to know how his brother was getting on, he should have to be\nseeing after her, instead of rushing straight to his brother, Levin\nconducted her to the room assigned them.",
      "Go, do go!",
      "she said, looking at him with timid and guilty eyes.",
      "He went out of the door without a word, and at once stumbled over Marya\nNikolaevna, who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to\nsee him.",
      "She was just the same as when he saw her in Moscow; the same\nwoolen gown, and bare arms and neck, and the same good-naturedly\nstupid, pockmarked face, only a little plumper.",
      "Well, how is he?",
      "how is he?",
      "Very bad.",
      "He can t get up.",
      "He has kept expecting you.",
      "He.... Are you\n... with your wife?",
      "Levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her,\nbut she immediately enlightened him.",
      "I ll go away.",
      "I ll go down to the kitchen,  she brought out.",
      "Nikolay\nDmitrievitch will be delighted.",
      "He heard about it, and knows your lady,\nand remembers her abroad.",
      "Levin realized that she meant his wife, and did not know what answer to\nmake.",
      "Come along, come along to him!",
      "he said.",
      "But as soon as he moved, the door of his room opened and Kitty peeped\nout.",
      "Levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife, who had\nput herself and him in such a difficult position; but Marya Nikolaevna\ncrimsoned still more.",
      "She positively shrank together and flushed to the\npoint of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands,\ntwisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to\ndo.",
      "For the first instant Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the\neyes with which Kitty looked at this awful woman, so incomprehensible\nto her; but it lasted only a single instant.",
      "Well!",
      "how is he?",
      "she turned to her husband and then to her.",
      "But one can t go on talking in the passage like this!",
      "Levin said,\nlooking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant\nacross the corridor, as though about his affairs.",
      "Well then, come in,  said Kitty, turning to Marya Nikolaevna, who had\nrecovered herself, but noticing her husband s face of dismay,  or go\non; go, and then come for me,  she said, and went back into the room.",
      "Levin went to his brother s room.",
      "He had not in the least expected what\nhe saw and felt in his brother s room.",
      "He had expected to find him in\nthe same state of self-deception which he had heard was so frequent\nwith the consumptive, and which had struck him so much during his\nbrother s visit in the autumn.",
      "He had expected to find the physical\nsigns of the approach of death more marked greater weakness, greater\nemaciation, but still almost the same condition of things.",
      "He had\nexpected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother\nhe loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then, only\nin a greater degree.",
      "And he had prepared himself for this; but he found\nsomething utterly different.",
      "In a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with\nspittle, and conversation audible through the thin partition from the\nnext room, in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities, on a\nbedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a\nbody.",
      "One arm of this body was above the quilt, and the wrist, huge as\na rake-handle, was attached, inconceivably it seemed, to the thin, long\nbone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle.",
      "The head lay\nsideways on the pillow.",
      "Levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat\non the temples and tense, transparent-looking forehead.",
      "It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?",
      "thought\nLevin.",
      "But he went closer, saw the face, and doubt became impossible.",
      "In spite of the terrible change in the face, Levin had only to glance\nat those eager eyes raised at his approach, only to catch the faint\nmovement of the mouth under the sticky mustache, to realize the\nterrible truth that this death-like body was his living brother.",
      "The glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as\nhe drew near.",
      "And immediately this glance established a living\nrelationship between living men.",
      "Levin immediately felt the reproach in\nthe eyes fixed on him, and felt remorse at his own happiness.",
      "When Konstantin took him by the hand, Nikolay smiled.",
      "The smile was\nfaint, scarcely perceptible, and in spite of the smile the stern\nexpression of the eyes was unchanged.",
      "You did not expect to find me like this,  he articulated with effort.",
      "Yes ... no,  said Levin, hesitating over his words.",
      "How was it you\ndidn t let me know before, that is, at the time of my wedding?",
      "I made\ninquiries in all directions.",
      "He had to talk so as not to be silent, and he did not know what to say,\nespecially as his brother made no reply, and simply stared without\ndropping his eyes, and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of\neach word.",
      "Levin told his brother that his wife had come with him.",
      "Nikolay expressed pleasure, but said he was afraid of frightening her\nby his condition.",
      "A silence followed.",
      "Suddenly Nikolay stirred, and\nbegan to say something.",
      "Levin expected something of peculiar gravity\nand importance from the expression of his face, but Nikolay began\nspeaking of his health.",
      "He found fault with the doctor, regretting he\nhad not a celebrated Moscow doctor.",
      "Levin saw that he still hoped.",
      "Seizing the first moment of silence, Levin got up, anxious to escape,\nif only for an instant, from his agonizing emotion, and said that he\nwould go and fetch his wife.",
      "Very well, and I ll tell her to tidy up here.",
      "It s dirty and stinking\nhere, I expect.",
      "Marya!",
      "clear up the room,  the sick man said with\neffort.",
      "Oh, and when you ve cleared up, go away yourself,  he added,\nlooking inquiringly at his brother.",
      "Levin made no answer.",
      "Going out into the corridor, he stopped short.",
      "He\nhad said he would fetch his wife, but now, taking stock of the emotion\nhe was feeling, he decided that he would try on the contrary to\npersuade her not to go in to the sick man.",
      "Why should she suffer as I\nam suffering?",
      "he thought.",
      "Well, how is he?",
      "Kitty asked with a frightened face.",
      "Oh, it s awful, it s awful!",
      "What did you come for?",
      "said Levin.",
      "Kitty was silent for a few seconds, looking timidly and ruefully at her\nhusband; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.",
      "Kostya!",
      "take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.",
      "You only take me, take me to him, please, and go away,  she said.",
      "You\nmust understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more\npainful.",
      "There I might be a help to you and to him.",
      "Please, let me!",
      "she besought her husband, as though the happiness of her life depended\non it.",
      "Levin was obliged to agree, and regaining his composure, and completely\nforgetting about Marya Nikolaevna by now, he went again in to his\nbrother with Kitty.",
      "Stepping lightly, and continually glancing at her husband, showing him\na valorous and sympathetic face, Kitty went into the sick-room, and,\nturning without haste, noiselessly closed the door.",
      "With inaudible\nsteps she went quickly to the sick man s bedside, and going up so that\nhe had not to turn his head, she immediately clasped in her fresh young\nhand the skeleton of his huge hand, pressed it, and began speaking with\nthat soft eagerness, sympathetic and not jarring, which is peculiar to\nwomen.",
      "We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,  she said.",
      "You\nnever thought I was to be your sister?",
      "You would not have recognized me?",
      "he said, with a radiant smile at\nher entrance.",
      "Yes, I should.",
      "What a good thing you let us know!",
      "Not a day has passed\nthat Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.",
      "But the sick man s interest did not last long.",
      "Before she had finished speaking, there had come back into his face the\nstern, reproachful expression of the dying man s envy of the living.",
      "I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,  she said, turning\naway from his fixed stare, and looking about the room.",
      "We must ask\nabout another room,  she said to her husband,  so that we might be\nnearer.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nLevin could not look calmly at his brother; he could not himself be\nnatural and calm in his presence.",
      "When he went in to the sick man, his\neyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed, and he did not see\nand did not distinguish the details of his brother s position.",
      "He smelt\nthe awful odor, saw the dirt, disorder, and miserable condition, and\nheard the groans, and felt that nothing could be done to help.",
      "It never\nentered his head to analyze the details of the sick man s situation, to\nconsider how that body was lying under the quilt, how those emaciated\nlegs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up, and whether they could\nnot be made more comfortable, whether anything could not be done to\nmake things, if not better, at least less bad.",
      "It made his blood run\ncold when he began to think of all these details.",
      "He was absolutely\nconvinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother s life or\nto relieve his suffering.",
      "But a sense of his regarding all aid as out\nof the question was felt by the sick man, and exasperated him.",
      "And this\nmade it still more painful for Levin.",
      "To be in the sick-room was agony\nto him, not to be there still worse.",
      "And he was continually, on various\npretexts, going out of the room, and coming in again, because he was\nunable to remain alone.",
      "But Kitty thought, and felt, and acted quite differently.",
      "On seeing the\nsick man, she pitied him.",
      "And pity in her womanly heart did not arouse\nat all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her\nhusband, but a desire to act, to find out all the details of his state,\nand to remedy them.",
      "And since she had not the slightest doubt that it\nwas her duty to help him, she had no doubt either that it was possible,\nand immediately set to work.",
      "The very details, the mere thought of\nwhich reduced her husband to terror, immediately engaged her attention.",
      "She sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist s, set the maid who had\ncome with her and Marya Nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub; she\nherself washed up something, washed out something else, laid something\nunder the quilt.",
      "Something was by her directions brought into the\nsick-room, something else was carried out.",
      "She herself went several\ntimes to her room, regardless of the men she met in the corridor, got\nout and brought in sheets, pillow cases, towels, and shirts.",
      "The waiter, who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining\nhall, came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her\nsummons, and could not avoid carrying out her orders, as she gave them\nwith such gracious insistence that there was no evading her.",
      "Levin did\nnot approve of all this; he did not believe it would be of any good to\nthe patient.",
      "Above all, he feared the patient would be angry at it.",
      "But\nthe sick man, though he seemed and was indifferent about it, was not\nangry, but only abashed, and on the whole as it were interested in what\nshe was doing with him.",
      "Coming back from the doctor to whom Kitty had\nsent him, Levin, on opening the door, came upon the sick man at the\ninstant when, by Kitty s directions, they were changing his linen.",
      "The\nlong white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades\nand jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the\nwaiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could\nnot get the long, limp arm into it.",
      "Kitty, hurriedly closing the door\nafter Levin, was not looking that way; but the sick man groaned, and\nshe moved rapidly towards him.",
      "Make haste,  she said.",
      "Oh, don t you come,  said the sick man angrily.",
      "I ll do it my\nmyself.... \n\n What say?",
      "queried Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "But Kitty heard and saw he was\nashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her.",
      "I m not looking, I m not looking!",
      "she said, putting the arm in.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it,  she added.",
      "Please go for me, there s a little bottle in my small bag,  she said,\nturning to her husband,  you know, in the side pocket; bring it,\nplease, and meanwhile they ll finish clearing up here.",
      "Returning with the bottle, Levin found the sick man settled comfortably\nand everything about him completely changed.",
      "The heavy smell was\nreplaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar, which Kitty with pouting\nlips and puffed-out, rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe.",
      "There was no dust visible anywhere, a rug was laid by the bedside.",
      "On\nthe table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged, and the\nlinen needed was folded up there, and Kitty s _broderie anglaise_.",
      "On\nthe other table by the patient s bed there were candles and drink and\npowders.",
      "The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets\non high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar\nabout his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope\nlooked fixedly at Kitty.",
      "The doctor brought by Levin, and found by him at the club, was not the\none who had been attending Nikolay Levin, as the patient was\ndissatisfied with him.",
      "The new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded\nthe patient, shook his head, prescribed medicine, and with extreme\nminuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet\nwas to be kept to.",
      "He advised eggs, raw or hardly cooked, and seltzer\nwater, with warm milk at a certain temperature.",
      "When the doctor had\ngone away the sick man said something to his brother, of which Levin\ncould distinguish only the last words:  Your Katya.",
      "By the expression\nwith which he gazed at her, Levin saw that he was praising her.",
      "He\ncalled indeed to Katya, as he called her.",
      "I m much better already,  he said.",
      "Why, with you I should have got\nwell long ago.",
      "How nice it is!",
      "he took her hand and drew it towards\nhis lips, but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his\nmind, let it go, and only stroked it.",
      "Kitty took his hand in both hers\nand pressed it.",
      "Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,  he said.",
      "No one could make out what he said but Kitty; she alone understood.",
      "She\nunderstood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what\nhe needed.",
      "On the other side,  she said to her husband,  he always sleeps on that\nside.",
      "Turn him over, it s so disagreeable calling the servants.",
      "I m not\nstrong enough.",
      "Can you?",
      "she said to Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "I m afraid not,  answered Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "Terrible as it was to Levin to put his arms round that terrible body,\nto take hold of that under the quilt, of which he preferred to know\nnothing, under his wife s influence he made his resolute face that she\nknew so well, and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body,\nbut in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness\nof those powerless limbs.",
      "While he was turning him over, conscious of\nthe huge emaciated arm about his neck, Kitty swiftly and noiselessly\nturned the pillow, beat it up and settled in it the sick man s head,\nsmoothing back his hair, which was sticking again to his moist brow.",
      "The sick man kept his brother s hand in his own.",
      "Levin felt that he\nmeant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere.",
      "Levin\nyielded with a sinking heart: yes, he drew it to his mouth and kissed\nit.",
      "Levin, shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word, went out\nof the room.",
      "Chapter 19\n\n Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast\nrevealed them unto babes.",
      "So Levin thought about his wife as he talked\nto her that evening.",
      "Levin thought of the text, not because he considered himself  wise and\nprudent.",
      "He did not so consider himself, but he could not help knowing\nthat he had more intellect than his wife and Agafea Mihalovna, and he\ncould not help knowing that when he thought of death, he thought with\nall the force of his intellect.",
      "He knew too that the brains of many\ngreat men, whose thoughts he had read, had brooded over death and yet\nknew not a hundredth part of what his wife and Agafea Mihalovna knew\nabout it.",
      "Different as those two women were, Agafea Mihalovna and\nKatya, as his brother Nikolay had called her, and as Levin particularly\nliked to call her now, they were quite alike in this.",
      "Both knew,\nwithout a shade of doubt, what sort of thing life was and what was\ndeath, and though neither of them could have answered, and would even\nnot have understood the questions that presented themselves to Levin,\nboth had no doubt of the significance of this event, and were precisely\nalike in their way of looking at it, which they shared with millions of\npeople.",
      "The proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death\nlay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to\ndeal with the dying, and were not frightened of them.",
      "Levin and other\nmen like him, though they could have said a great deal about death,\nobviously did not know this since they were afraid of death, and were\nabsolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying.",
      "If Levin had\nbeen alone now with his brother Nikolay, he would have looked at him\nwith terror, and with still greater terror waited, and would not have\nknown what else to do.",
      "More than that, he did not know what to say, how to look, how to move.",
      "To talk of outside things seemed to him shocking, impossible, to talk\nof death and depressing subjects also impossible.",
      "To be silent, also\nimpossible.",
      "If I look at him he will think I am studying him, I am\nafraid; if I don t look at him, he ll think I m thinking of other\nthings.",
      "If I walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to tread firmly, I m\nashamed.",
      "Kitty evidently did not think of herself, and had no time to\nthink about herself: she was thinking about him because she knew\nsomething, and all went well.",
      "She told him about herself even and about\nher wedding, and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him, and\ntalked of cases of recovery and all went well; so then she must know.",
      "The proof that her behavior and Agafea Mihalovna s was not instinctive,\nanimal, irrational, was that apart from the physical treatment, the\nrelief of suffering, both Agafea Mihalovna and Kitty required for the\ndying man something else more important than the physical treatment,\nand something which had nothing in common with physical conditions.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, speaking of the man just dead, had said:  Well, thank\nGod, he took the sacrament and received absolution; God grant each one\nof us such a death.",
      "Katya in just the same way, besides all her care\nabout linen, bedsores, drink, found time the very first day to persuade\nthe sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving\nabsolution.",
      "On getting back from the sick-room to their own two rooms for the\nnight, Levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do.",
      "Not to speak\nof supper, of preparing for bed, of considering what they were going to\ndo, he could not even talk to his wife; he was ashamed to.",
      "Kitty, on\nthe contrary, was more active than usual.",
      "She was even livelier than\nusual.",
      "She ordered supper to be brought, herself unpacked their things,\nand herself helped to make the beds, and did not even forget to\nsprinkle them with Persian powder.",
      "She showed that alertness, that\nswiftness of reflection which comes out in men before a battle, in\nconflict, in the dangerous and decisive moments of life those moments\nwhen a man shows once and for all his value, and that all his past has\nnot been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments.",
      "Everything went rapidly in her hands, and before it was twelve o clock\nall their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms, in such\na way that the hotel rooms seemed like home: the beds were made,\nbrushes, combs, looking-glasses were put out, table napkins were\nspread.",
      "Levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat, to sleep, to talk even now,\nand it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly.",
      "She\narranged the brushes, but she did it all so that there was nothing\nshocking in it.",
      "They could neither of them eat, however, and for a long while they\ncould not sleep, and did not even go to bed.",
      "I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow, \nshe said, sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding\nlooking-glass, combing her soft, fragrant hair with a fine comb.",
      "I\nhave never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are prayers\nsaid for recovery.",
      "Do you suppose he can possibly recover?",
      "said Levin, watching a\nslender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually\nhidden when she passed the comb through the front.",
      "I asked the doctor; he said he couldn t live more than three days.",
      "But\ncan they be sure?",
      "I m very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him,  she\nsaid, looking askance at her husband through her hair.",
      "Anything is\npossible,  she added with that peculiar, rather sly expression that was\nalways in her face when she spoke of religion.",
      "Since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither\nof them had ever started a discussion of the subject, but she performed\nall the ceremonies of going to church, saying her prayers, and so on,\nalways with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so.",
      "In spite\nof his assertion to the contrary, she was firmly persuaded that he was\nas much a Christian as she, and indeed a far better one; and all that\nhe said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks, just as\nhe would say about her _broderie anglaise_ that good people patch\nholes, but that she cut them on purpose, and so on.",
      "Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to manage\nall this,  said Levin.",
      "And ...",
      "I must own I m very, very glad you\ncame.",
      "You are such purity that....",
      "He took her hand and did not kiss\nit (to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him\nimproper); he merely squeezed it with a penitent air, looking at her\nbrightening eyes.",
      "It would have been miserable for you to be alone,  she said, and\nlifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure, twisted\nher coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there.",
      "No,  she\nwent on,  she did not know how.... Luckily, I learned a lot at Soden.",
      "Surely there are not people there so ill?",
      "Worse.",
      "What s so awful to me is that I can t see him as he was when he was\nyoung.",
      "You would not believe how charming he was as a youth, but I did\nnot understand him then.",
      "I can quite, quite believe it.",
      "How I feel that we might have been\nfriends!",
      "she said; and, distressed at what she had said, she looked\nround at her husband, and tears came into her eyes.",
      "Yes, _might have been_,  he said mournfully.",
      "He s just one of those\npeople of whom they say they re not for this world.",
      "But we have many days before us; we must go to bed,  said Kitty,\nglancing at her tiny watch.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nThe next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction.",
      "During the ceremony Nikolay Levin prayed fervently.",
      "His great eyes,\nfastened on the holy image that was set out on a card-table covered\nwith a colored napkin, expressed such passionate prayer and hope that\nit was awful to Levin to see it.",
      "Levin knew that this passionate prayer\nand hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life\nhe so loved.",
      "Levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect:\nhe knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him\nwithout faith, but had grown up because step by step the contemporary\nscientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the\npossibility of faith; and so he knew that his present return was not a\nlegitimate one, brought about by way of the same working of his\nintellect, but simply a temporary, interested return to faith in a\ndesperate hope of recovery.",
      "Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened\nhis hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of.",
      "Levin knew all this; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold\nthe supplicating, hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist, lifted with\ndifficulty, making the sign of the cross on the tense brow, and the\nprominent shoulders and hollow, gasping chest, which one could not feel\nconsistent with the life the sick man was praying for.",
      "During the\nsacrament Levin did what he, an unbeliever, had done a thousand times.",
      "He said, addressing God,  If Thou dost exist, make this man to recover \n(of course this same thing has been repeated many times),  and Thou\nwilt save him and me.",
      "After extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better.",
      "He did\nnot cough once in the course of an hour, smiled, kissed Kitty s hand,\nthanking her with tears, and said he was comfortable, free from pain,\nand that he felt strong and had an appetite.",
      "He even raised himself\nwhen his soup was brought, and asked for a cutlet as well.",
      "Hopelessly\nill as he was, obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not\nrecover, Levin and Kitty were for that hour both in the same state of\nexcitement, happy, though fearful of being mistaken.",
      "Is he better?",
      "Yes, much.",
      "It s wonderful.",
      "There s nothing wonderful in it.",
      "Anyway, he s better,  they said in a whisper, smiling to one another.",
      "This self-deception was not of long duration.",
      "The sick man fell into a\nquiet sleep, but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough.",
      "And\nall at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself.",
      "The\nreality of his suffering crushed all hopes in Levin and Kitty and in\nthe sick man himself, leaving no doubt, no memory even of past hopes.",
      "Without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before, as\nthough ashamed even to recall it, he asked for iodine to inhale in a\nbottle covered with perforated paper.",
      "Levin gave him the bottle, and\nthe same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament\nwas now fastened on his brother, demanding from him the confirmation of\nthe doctor s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.",
      "Is Katya not here?",
      "he gasped, looking round while Levin reluctantly\nassented to the doctor s words.",
      "No; so I can say it....",
      "It was for her\nsake I went through that farce.",
      "She s so sweet; but you and I can t\ndeceive ourselves.",
      "This is what I believe in,  he said, and, squeezing\nthe bottle in his bony hand, he began breathing over it.",
      "At eight o clock in the evening Levin and his wife were drinking tea in\ntheir room when Marya Nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly.",
      "She was\npale, and her lips were quivering.",
      "He is dying!",
      "she whispered.",
      "I m\nafraid will die this minute.",
      "Both of them ran to him.",
      "He was sitting raised up with one elbow on the\nbed, his long back bent, and his head hanging low.",
      "How do you feel?",
      "Levin asked in a whisper, after a silence.",
      "I feel I m setting off,  Nikolay said with difficulty, but with\nextreme distinctness, screwing the words out of himself.",
      "He did not\nraise his head, but simply turned his eyes upwards, without their\nreaching his brother s face.",
      "Katya, go away!",
      "he added.",
      "Levin jumped up, and with a peremptory whisper made her go out.",
      "I m setting off,  he said again.",
      "Why do you think so?",
      "said Levin, so as to say something.",
      "Because I m setting off,  he repeated, as though he had a liking for\nthe phrase.",
      "It s the end.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna went up to him.",
      "You had better lie down; you d be easier,  she said.",
      "I shall lie down soon enough,  he pronounced slowly,  when I m dead, \nhe said sarcastically, wrathfully.",
      "Well, you can lay me down if you\nlike.",
      "Levin laid his brother on his back, sat down beside him, and gazed at\nhis face, holding his breath.",
      "The dying man lay with closed eyes, but\nthe muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead, as with one\nthinking deeply and intensely.",
      "Levin involuntarily thought with him of\nwhat it was that was happening to him now, but in spite of all his\nmental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that\ncalm, stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and\nclearer that was still as dark as ever for Levin.",
      "Yes, yes, so,  the dying man articulated slowly at intervals.",
      "Wait a\nlittle.",
      "He was silent.",
      "Right!",
      "he pronounced all at once\nreassuringly, as though all were solved for him.",
      "O Lord!",
      "he murmured,\nand sighed deeply.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna felt his feet.",
      "They re getting cold,  she whispered.",
      "For a long while, a very long while it seemed to Levin, the sick man\nlay motionless.",
      "But he was still alive, and from time to time he\nsighed.",
      "Levin by now was exhausted from mental strain.",
      "He felt that,\nwith no mental effort, could he understand what it was that was\n_right_.",
      "He could not even think of the problem of death itself, but\nwith no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to\ndo next; closing the dead man s eyes, dressing him, ordering the\ncoffin.",
      "And, strange to say, he felt utterly cold, and was not\nconscious of sorrow nor of loss, less still of pity for his brother.",
      "If\nhe had any feeling for his brother at that moment, it was envy for the\nknowledge the dying man had now that he could not have.",
      "A long time more he sat over him so, continually expecting the end.",
      "But\nthe end did not come.",
      "The door opened and Kitty appeared.",
      "Levin got up\nto stop her.",
      "But at the moment he was getting up, he caught the sound\nof the dying man stirring.",
      "Don t go away,  said Nikolay and held out his hand.",
      "Levin gave him\nhis, and angrily waved to his wife to go away.",
      "With the dying man s hand in his hand, he sat for half an hour, an\nhour, another hour.",
      "He did not think of death at all now.",
      "He wondered\nwhat Kitty was doing; who lived in the next room; whether the doctor\nlived in a house of his own.",
      "He longed for food and for sleep.",
      "He\ncautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet.",
      "The feet were cold,\nbut the sick man was still breathing.",
      "Levin tried again to move away on\ntiptoe, but the sick man stirred again and said:  Don t go.",
      "The dawn came; the sick man s condition was unchanged.",
      "Levin stealthily\nwithdrew his hand, and without looking at the dying man, went off to\nhis own room and went to sleep.",
      "When he woke up, instead of news of his\nbrother s death which he expected, he learned that the sick man had\nreturned to his earlier condition.",
      "He had begun sitting up again,\ncoughing, had begun eating again, talking again, and again had ceased\nto talk of death, again had begun to express hope of his recovery, and\nhad become more irritable and more gloomy than ever.",
      "No one, neither\nhis brother nor Kitty, could soothe him.",
      "He was angry with everyone,\nand said nasty things to everyone, reproached everyone for his\nsufferings, and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor\nfrom Moscow.",
      "To all inquiries made him as to how he felt, he made the\nsame answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness,  I m\nsuffering horribly, intolerably!",
      "The sick man was suffering more and more, especially from bedsores,\nwhich it was impossible now to remedy, and grew more and more angry\nwith everyone about him, blaming them for everything, and especially\nfor not having brought him a doctor from Moscow.",
      "Kitty tried in every\npossible way to relieve him, to soothe him; but it was all in vain, and\nLevin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally,\nthough she would not admit it.",
      "The sense of death, which had been\nevoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent\nfor his brother, was broken up.",
      "Everyone knew that he must inevitably\ndie soon, that he was half dead already.",
      "Everyone wished for nothing\nbut that he should die as soon as possible, and everyone, concealing\nthis, gave him medicines, tried to find remedies and doctors, and\ndeceived him and themselves and each other.",
      "All this was falsehood,\ndisgusting, irreverent deceit.",
      "And owing to the bent of his character,\nand because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did, Levin was\nmost painfully conscious of this deceit.",
      "Levin, who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his\nbrothers, at least in face of death, had written to his brother, Sergey\nIvanovitch, and having received an answer from him, he read this letter\nto the sick man.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wrote that he could not come\nhimself, and in touching terms he begged his brother s forgiveness.",
      "The sick man said nothing.",
      "What am I to write to him?",
      "said Levin.",
      "I hope you are not angry with\nhim?",
      "No, not the least!",
      "Nikolay answered, vexed at the question.",
      "Tell him\nto send me a doctor.",
      "Three more days of agony followed; the sick man was still in the same\ncondition.",
      "The sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now\nat the mere sight of him, by the waiters and the hotel-keeper and all\nthe people staying in the hotel, and the doctor and Marya Nikolaevna\nand Levin and Kitty.",
      "The sick man alone did not express this feeling,\nbut on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors, and\nwent on taking medicine and talking of life.",
      "Only at rare moments, when\nthe opium gave him an instant s relief from the never-ceasing pain, he\nwould sometimes, half asleep, utter what was ever more intense in his\nheart than in all the others:  Oh, if it were only the end!",
      "or:  When\nwill it be over?",
      "His sufferings, steadily growing more intense, did their work and\nprepared him for death.",
      "There was no position in which he was not in\npain, there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it, not a\nlimb, not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony.",
      "Even the memories, the impressions, the thoughts of this body awakened\nin him now the same aversion as the body itself.",
      "The sight of other\npeople, their remarks, his own reminiscences, everything was for him a\nsource of agony.",
      "Those about him felt this, and instinctively did not\nallow themselves to move freely, to talk, to express their wishes\nbefore him.",
      "All his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and\ndesire to be rid of it.",
      "There was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him\nlook upon death as the goal of his desires, as happiness.",
      "Hitherto each\nindividual desire, aroused by suffering or privation, such as hunger,\nfatigue, thirst, had been satisfied by some bodily function giving\npleasure.",
      "But now no physical craving or suffering received relief, and\nthe effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering.",
      "And so all\ndesires were merged in one the desire to be rid of all his sufferings\nand their source, the body.",
      "But he had no words to express this desire\nof deliverance, and so he did not speak of it, and from habit asked for\nthe satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied.",
      "Turn me\nover on the other side,  he would say, and immediately after he would\nask to be turned back again as before.",
      "Give me some broth.",
      "Take away\nthe broth.",
      "Talk of something: why are you silent?",
      "And directly they\nbegan to talk he would close his eyes, and would show weariness,\nindifference, and loathing.",
      "On the tenth day from their arrival at the town, Kitty was unwell.",
      "She\nsuffered from headache and sickness, and she could not get up all the\nmorning.",
      "The doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and\nexcitement, and prescribed rest.",
      "After dinner, however, Kitty got up and went as usual with her work to\nthe sick man.",
      "He looked at her sternly when she came in, and smiled\ncontemptuously when she said she had been unwell.",
      "That day he was\ncontinually blowing his nose, and groaning piteously.",
      "How do you feel?",
      "she asked him.",
      "Worse,  he articulated with difficulty.",
      "In pain!",
      "In pain, where?",
      "Everywhere.",
      "It will be over today, you will see,  said Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "Though it\nwas said in a whisper, the sick man, whose hearing Levin had noticed\nwas very keen, must have heard.",
      "Levin said hush to her, and looked\nround at the sick man.",
      "Nikolay had heard; but these words produced no\neffect on him.",
      "His eyes had still the same intense, reproachful look.",
      "Why do you think so?",
      "Levin asked her, when she had followed him into\nthe corridor.",
      "He has begun picking at himself,  said Marya Nikolaevna.",
      "How do you mean?",
      "Like this,  she said, tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt.",
      "Levin\nnoticed, indeed, that all that day the patient pulled at himself, as it\nwere, trying to snatch something away.",
      "Marya Nikolaevna s prediction came true.",
      "Towards night the sick man was\nnot able to lift his hands, and could only gaze before him with the\nsame intensely concentrated expression in his eyes.",
      "Even when his\nbrother or Kitty bent over him, so that he could see them, he looked\njust the same.",
      "Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the\ndying.",
      "While the priest was reading it, the dying man did not show any sign of\nlife; his eyes were closed.",
      "Levin, Kitty, and Marya Nikolaevna stood at\nthe bedside.",
      "The priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when\nthe dying man stretched, sighed, and opened his eyes.",
      "The priest, on\nfinishing the prayer, put the cross to the cold forehead, then slowly\nreturned it to the stand, and after standing for two minutes more in\nsilence, he touched the huge, bloodless hand that was turning cold.",
      "He is gone,  said the priest, and would have moved away; but suddenly\nthere was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed\nglued together, and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the\nbottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds:\n\n Not quite ... soon.",
      "And a minute later the face brightened, a smile came out under the\nmustaches, and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying\nout the corpse.",
      "The sight of his brother, and the nearness of death, revived in Levin\nthat sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma, together with the\nnearness and inevitability of death, that had come upon him that autumn\nevening when his brother had come to him.",
      "This feeling was now even\nstronger than before; even less than before did he feel capable of\napprehending the meaning of death, and its inevitability rose up before\nhim more terrible than ever.",
      "But now, thanks to his wife s presence,\nthat feeling did not reduce him to despair.",
      "In spite of death, he felt\nthe need of life and love.",
      "He felt that love saved him from despair,\nand that this love, under the menace of despair, had become still\nstronger and purer.",
      "The one mystery of death, still unsolved, had\nscarcely passed before his eyes, when another mystery had arisen, as\ninsoluble, urging him to love and to life.",
      "The doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to Kitty.",
      "Her\nindisposition was a symptom that she was with child.",
      "Chapter 21\n\nFrom the moment when Alexey Alexandrovitch understood from his\ninterviews with Betsy and with Stepan Arkadyevitch that all that was\nexpected of him was to leave his wife in peace, without burdening her\nwith his presence, and that his wife herself desired this, he felt so\ndistraught that he could come to no decision of himself; he did not\nknow himself what he wanted now, and putting himself in the hands of\nthose who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs, he met\neverything with unqualified assent.",
      "It was only when Anna had left his\nhouse, and the English governess sent to ask him whether she should\ndine with him or separately, that for the first time he clearly\ncomprehended his position, and was appalled by it.",
      "Most difficult of\nall in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect\nand reconcile his past with what was now.",
      "It was not the past when he\nhad lived happily with his wife that troubled him.",
      "The transition from\nthat past to a knowledge of his wife s unfaithfulness he had lived\nthrough miserably already; that state was painful, but he could\nunderstand it.",
      "If his wife had then, on declaring to him her\nunfaithfulness, left him, he would have been wounded, unhappy, but he\nwould not have been in the hopeless position incomprehensible to\nhimself in which he felt himself now.",
      "He could not now reconcile his\nimmediate past, his tenderness, his love for his sick wife, and for the\nother man s child with what was now the case, that is with the fact\nthat, as it were, in return for all this he now found himself alone,\nput to shame, a laughing-stock, needed by no one, and despised by\neveryone.",
      "For the first two days after his wife s departure Alexey Alexandrovitch\nreceived applicants for assistance and his chief secretary, drove to\nthe committee, and went down to dinner in the dining-room as usual.",
      "Without giving himself a reason for what he was doing, he strained\nevery nerve of his being for those two days, simply to preserve an\nappearance of composure, and even of indifference.",
      "Answering inquiries\nabout the disposition of Anna Arkadyevna s rooms and belongings, he had\nexercised immense self-control to appear like a man in whose eyes what\nhad occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of\nevents, and he attained his aim: no one could have detected in him\nsigns of despair.",
      "But on the second day after her departure, when\nKorney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper s shop, which Anna had\nforgotten to pay, and announced that the clerk from the shop was\nwaiting, Alexey Alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up.",
      "Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you.",
      "But if you\ndirect us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us\nwith her address?",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered, as it seemed to the clerk, and all at\nonce, turning round, he sat down at the table.",
      "Letting his head sink\ninto his hands, he sat for a long while in that position, several times\nattempted to speak and stopped short.",
      "Korney, perceiving his master s\nemotion, asked the clerk to call another time.",
      "Left alone, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the\nline of firmness and composure any longer.",
      "He gave orders for the\ncarriage that was awaiting him to be taken back, and for no one to be\nadmitted, and he did not go down to dinner.",
      "He felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and\nexasperation, which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and\nof Korney, and of everyone, without exception, whom he had met during\nthose two days.",
      "He felt that he could not turn aside from himself the\nhatred of men, because that hatred did not come from his being bad (in\nthat case he could have tried to be better), but from his being\nshamefully and repulsively unhappy.",
      "He knew that for this, for the very\nfact that his heart was torn with grief, they would be merciless to\nhim.",
      "He felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog\nyelping with pain.",
      "He knew that his sole means of security against\npeople was to hide his wounds from them, and instinctively he tried to\ndo this for two days, but now he felt incapable of keeping up the\nunequal struggle.",
      "His despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was\nutterly alone in his sorrow.",
      "In all Petersburg there was not a human\nbeing to whom he could express what he was feeling, who would feel for\nhim, not as a high official, not as a member of society, but simply as\na suffering man; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch grew up an orphan.",
      "There were two brothers.",
      "They\ndid not remember their father, and their mother died when Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was ten years old.",
      "The property was a small one.",
      "Their\nuncle, Karenin, a government official of high standing, at one time a\nfavorite of the late Tsar, had brought them up.",
      "On completing his high school and university courses with medals,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had, with his uncle s aid, immediately started in\na prominent position in the service, and from that time forward he had\ndevoted himself exclusively to political ambition.",
      "In the high school\nand the university, and afterwards in the service, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone.",
      "His\nbrother had been the person nearest to his heart, but he had a post in\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was always abroad, where he had\ndied shortly after Alexey Alexandrovitch s marriage.",
      "While he was governor of a province, Anna s aunt, a wealthy provincial\nlady, had thrown him middle-aged as he was, though young for a\ngovernor with her niece, and had succeeded in putting him in such a\nposition that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation.",
      "There were at the\ntime as many reasons for the step as against it, and there was no\noverbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of\nabstaining when in doubt.",
      "But Anna s aunt had through a common\nacquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl, and\nthat he was in honor bound to make her an offer.",
      "He made the offer, and\nconcentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he\nwas capable.",
      "The attachment he felt to Anna precluded in his heart every need of\nintimate relations with others.",
      "And now among all his acquaintances he\nhad not one friend.",
      "He had plenty of so-called connections, but no\nfriendships.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could\ninvite to dinner, to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public\naffair he was concerned about, whose interest he could reckon upon for\nanyone he wished to help, with whom he could candidly discuss other\npeople s business and affairs of state.",
      "But his relations with these\npeople were confined to one clearly defined channel, and had a certain\nroutine from which it was impossible to depart.",
      "There was one man, a\ncomrade of his at the university, with whom he had made friends later,\nand with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow; but this\nfriend had a post in the Department of Education in a remote part of\nRussia.",
      "Of the people in Petersburg the most intimate and most possible\nwere his chief secretary and his doctor.",
      "Mihail Vassilievitch Sludin, the chief secretary, was a\nstraightforward, intelligent, good-hearted, and conscientious man, and\nAlexey Alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill.",
      "But their\nfive years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier\nbetween them that cut off warmer relations.",
      "After signing the papers brought him, Alexey Alexandrovitch had sat for\na long while in silence, glancing at Mihail Vassilievitch, and several\ntimes he attempted to speak, but could not.",
      "He had already prepared the\nphrase:  You have heard of my trouble?",
      "But he ended by saying, as\nusual:  So you ll get this ready for me?",
      "and with that dismissed him.",
      "The other person was the doctor, who had also a kindly feeling for him;\nbut there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that\nboth were weighed down by work, and always in a hurry.",
      "Of his women friends, foremost amongst them Countess Lidia Ivanovna,\nAlexey Alexandrovitch never thought.",
      "All women, simply as women, were\nterrible and distasteful to him.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had forgotten the Countess Lidia Ivanovna, but\nshe had not forgotten him.",
      "At the bitterest moment of his lonely\ndespair she came to him, and without waiting to be announced, walked\nstraight into his study.",
      "She found him as he was sitting with his head\nin both hands.",
      "_J ai forc  la consigne_,  she said, walking in with rapid steps and\nbreathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise.",
      "I have heard all!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "Dear friend!",
      "she went on, warmly squeezing his\nhand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, frowning, got up, and disengaging his hand,\nmoved her a chair.",
      "Won t you sit down, countess?",
      "I m seeing no one because I m unwell,\ncountess,  he said, and his lips twitched.",
      "Dear friend!",
      "repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking her eyes\noff his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners,\ndescribing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow face became\nstill uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him\nand was preparing to cry.",
      "And he too was softened; he snatched her\nplump hand and proceeded to kiss it.",
      "Dear friend!",
      "she said in a voice breaking with emotion.",
      "You ought\nnot to give way to grief.",
      "Your sorrow is a great one, but you ought to\nfind consolation.",
      "I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!",
      "said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, letting go her hand, but still gazing into her brimming\neyes.",
      "My position is so awful because I can find nowhere, I cannot\nfind within me strength to support me.",
      "You will find support; seek it not in me, though I beseech you to\nbelieve in my friendship,  she said, with a sigh.",
      "Our support is love,\nthat love that He has vouchsafed us.",
      "His burden is light,  she said,\nwith the look of ecstasy Alexey Alexandrovitch knew so well.",
      "He will\nbe your support and your succor.",
      "Although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion\nat her own lofty feelings, and that new mystical fervor which had\nlately gained ground in Petersburg, and which seemed to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch disproportionate, still it was pleasant to him to hear\nthis now.",
      "I am weak.",
      "I am crushed.",
      "I foresaw nothing, and now I understand\nnothing.",
      "Dear friend,  repeated Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "It s not the loss of what I have not now, it s not that!",
      "pursued\nAlexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I do not grieve for that.",
      "But I cannot help\nfeeling humiliated before other people for the position I am placed in.",
      "It is wrong, but I can t help it, I can t help it.",
      "Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was\nmoved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within your\nheart,  said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, raising her eyes rapturously,\n and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch knitted his brows, and crooking his hands, he\ncracked his fingers.",
      "One must know all the facts,  he said in his thin voice.",
      "A man s\nstrength has its limits, countess, and I have reached my limits.",
      "The\nwhole day I have had to be making arrangements, arrangements about\nhousehold matters arising  (he emphasized the word _arising_)  from my\nnew, solitary position.",
      "The servants, the governess, the accounts....",
      "These pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart, and I have not the\nstrength to bear it.",
      "At dinner ... yesterday, I was almost getting up\nfrom the dinner-table.",
      "I could not bear the way my son looked at me.",
      "He\ndid not ask me the meaning of it all, but he wanted to ask, and I could\nnot bear the look in his eyes.",
      "He was afraid to look at me, but that is\nnot all....  Alexey Alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that\nhad been brought him, but his voice shook, and he stopped.",
      "That bill on\nblue paper, for a hat and ribbons, he could not recall without a rush\nof self-pity.",
      "I understand, dear friend,  said Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "I understand it all.",
      "Succor and comfort you will find not in me, though I have come only to\naid you if I can.",
      "If I could take from off you all these petty,\nhumiliating cares ...",
      "I understand that a woman s word, a woman s\nsuperintendence is needed.",
      "You will intrust it to me?",
      "Silently and gratefully Alexey Alexandrovitch pressed her hand.",
      "Together we will take care of Seryozha.",
      "Practical affairs are not my\nstrong point.",
      "But I will set to work.",
      "I will be your housekeeper.",
      "Don t\nthank me.",
      "I do it not from myself....",
      "I cannot help thanking you.",
      "But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you\nspoke being ashamed of what is the Christian s highest glory: _he who\nhumbles himself shall be exalted_.",
      "And you cannot thank me.",
      "You must\nthank Him, and pray to Him for succor.",
      "In Him alone we find peace,\nconsolation, salvation, and love,  she said, and turning her eyes\nheavenwards, she began praying, as Alexey Alexandrovitch gathered from\nher silence.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch listened to her now, and those expressions which\nhad seemed to him, if not distasteful, at least exaggerated, now seemed\nto him natural and consolatory.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch had disliked this\nnew enthusiastic fervor.",
      "He was a believer, who was interested in\nreligion primarily in its political aspect, and the new doctrine which\nventured upon several new interpretations, just because it paved the\nway to discussion and analysis, was in principle disagreeable to him.",
      "He had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this\nnew doctrine, and with Countess Lidia Ivanovna, who had been carried\naway by it, he had never argued, but by silence had assiduously parried\nher attempts to provoke him into argument.",
      "Now for the first time he\nheard her words with pleasure, and did not inwardly oppose them.",
      "I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your\nwords,  he said, when she had finished praying.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna once more pressed both her friend s hands.",
      "Now I will enter upon my duties,  she said with a smile after a pause,\nas she wiped away the traces of tears.",
      "I am going to Seryozha.",
      "Only in\nthe last extremity shall I apply to you.",
      "And she got up and went out.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna went into Seryozha s part of the house, and\ndropping tears on the scared child s cheeks, she told him that his\nfather was a saint and his mother was dead.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna kept her promise.",
      "She did actually take upon\nherself the care of the organization and management of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch s household.",
      "But she had not overstated the case when\nsaying that practical affairs were not her strong point.",
      "All her\narrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out,\nand they were modified by Korney, Alexey Alexandrovitch s valet, who,\nthough no one was aware of the fact, now managed Karenin s household,\nand quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing\nall it was necessary for him to know.",
      "But Lidia Ivanovna s help was\nnone the less real; she gave Alexey Alexandrovitch moral support in the\nconsciousness of her love and respect for him, and still more, as it\nwas soothing to her to believe, in that she almost turned him to\nChristianity that is, from an indifferent and apathetic believer she\nturned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new\ninterpretation of Christian doctrine, which had been gaining ground of\nlate in Petersburg.",
      "It was easy for Alexey Alexandrovitch to believe in\nthis teaching.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, like Lidia Ivanovna indeed, and\nothers who shared their views, was completely devoid of vividness of\nimagination, that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions\nevoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in\nharmony with other conceptions, and with actual fact.",
      "He saw nothing\nimpossible and inconceivable in the idea that death, though existing\nfor unbelievers, did not exist for him, and that, as he was possessed\nof the most perfect faith, of the measure of which he was himself the\njudge, therefore there was no sin in his soul, and he was experiencing\ncomplete salvation here on earth.",
      "It is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of\nhis faith was dimly perceptible to Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he knew\nthat when, without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the\naction of a higher power, he had surrendered directly to the feeling of\nforgiveness, he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking\nevery instant that Christ was in his heart, and that in signing\nofficial papers he was doing His will.",
      "But for Alexey Alexandrovitch it\nwas a necessity to think in that way; it was such a necessity for him\nin his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint, however imaginary,\nfrom which, looked down upon by all, he could look down on others, that\nhe clung, as to his one salvation, to his delusion of salvation.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nThe Countess Lidia Ivanovna had, as a very young and sentimental girl,\nbeen married to a wealthy man of high rank, an extremely good-natured,\njovial, and extremely dissipated rake.",
      "Two months after marriage her\nhusband abandoned her, and her impassioned protestations of affection\nhe met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the\ncount s good heart, and seeing no defects in the sentimental Lidia,\nwere at a loss to explain.",
      "Though they were divorced and lived apart,\nyet whenever the husband met the wife, he invariably behaved to her\nwith the same malignant irony, the cause of which was incomprehensible.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna had long given up being in love with her\nhusband, but from that time she had never given up being in love with\nsomeone.",
      "She was in love with several people at once, both men and\nwomen; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been\nparticularly distinguished in any way.",
      "She was in love with all the new\nprinces and princesses who married into the imperial family; she had\nbeen in love with a high dignitary of the Church, a vicar, and a parish\npriest; she had been in love with a journalist, three Slavophiles, with\nKomissarov, with a minister, a doctor, an English missionary and\nKarenin.",
      "All these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent,\ndid not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated\nrelations with the court and fashionable society.",
      "But from the time\nthat after Karenin s trouble she took him under her special protection,\nfrom the time that she set to work in Karenin s household looking after\nhis welfare, she felt that all her other attachments were not the real\nthing, and that she was now genuinely in love, and with no one but\nKarenin.",
      "The feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger\nthan any of her former feelings.",
      "Analyzing her feeling, and comparing\nit with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not\nhave been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the\nTsar, that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if\nthere had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for\nhimself, for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet to her high\nnotes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his\ncharacter, and his soft white hands with their swollen veins.",
      "She was\nnot simply overjoyed at meeting him, but she sought in his face signs\nof the impression she was making on him.",
      "She tried to please him, not\nby her words only, but in her whole person.",
      "For his sake it was that\nshe now lavished more care on her dress than before.",
      "She caught herself\nin reveries on what might have been, if she had not been married and he\nhad been free.",
      "She blushed with emotion when he came into the room, she\ncould not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to\nher.",
      "For several days now Countess Lidia Ivanovna had been in a state of\nintense excitement.",
      "She had learned that Anna and Vronsky were in\nPetersburg.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her, he\nmust be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman\nwas in the same town with him, and that he might meet her any minute.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those\n_infamous people_, as she called Anna and Vronsky, intended doing, and\nshe endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those\ndays that he could not come across them.",
      "The young adjutant, an\nacquaintance of Vronsky, through whom she obtained her information, and\nwho hoped through Countess Lidia Ivanovna to obtain a concession, told\nher that they had finished their business and were going away next day.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna had already begun to calm down, when the next morning a\nnote was brought her, the handwriting of which she recognized with\nhorror.",
      "It was the handwriting of Anna Karenina.",
      "The envelope was of\npaper as thick as bark; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge\nmonogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent.",
      "Who brought it?",
      "A commissionaire from the hotel.",
      "It was some time before Countess Lidia Ivanovna could sit down to read\nthe letter.",
      "Her excitement brought on an attack of asthma, to which she\nwas subject.",
      "When she had recovered her composure, she read the\nfollowing letter in French:\n\n\n\n\n\n Madame la Comtesse,\n\n The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the, I\nfeel, unpardonable boldness to write to you.",
      "I am miserable at being\nseparated from my son.",
      "I entreat permission to see him once before my\ndeparture.",
      "Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory.",
      "I apply to\nyou and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply because I do not wish to\ncause that generous man to suffer in remembering me.",
      "Knowing your\nfriendship for him, I know you will understand me.",
      "Could you send\nSeryozha to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or\nwill you let me know when and where I could see him away from home?",
      "I\ndo not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him with whom\nit rests.",
      "You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him, and so\ncannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.",
      "Anna.",
      "Everything in this letter exasperated Countess Lidia Ivanovna: its\ncontents and the allusion to magnanimity, and especially its free and\neasy as she considered tone.",
      "Say that there is no answer,  said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, and\nimmediately opening her blotting-book, she wrote to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o clock at the levee.",
      "I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject.",
      "There we will\narrange where to meet.",
      "Best of all at my house, where I will order tea\n_as you like it_.",
      "Urgent.",
      "He lays the cross, but He gives the strength\nto bear it,  she added, so as to give him some slight preparation.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day\nto Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "She enjoyed that form of communication, which\ngave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by\ntheir personal interviews.",
      "Chapter 24\n\nThe levee was drawing to a close.",
      "People met as they were going away,\nand gossiped of the latest news, of the newly bestowed honors and the\nchanges in the positions of the higher functionaries.",
      "If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess\nVatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,  said a gray-headed, little old\nman in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of\nhonor who had questioned him about the new appointments.",
      "And me among the adjutants,  said the maid of honor, smiling.",
      "You have an appointment already.",
      "You re over the ecclesiastical\ndepartment.",
      "And your assistant s Karenin.",
      "Good-day, prince!",
      "said the little old man to a man who came up to\nhim.",
      "What were you saying of Karenin?",
      "said the prince.",
      "He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.",
      "I thought he had it already.",
      "No.",
      "Just look at him,  said the little old man, pointing with his\nembroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon\nacross his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an\ninfluential member of the Imperial Council.",
      "Pleased and happy as a\nbrass farthing,  he added, stopping to shake hands with a handsome\ngentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions.",
      "No; he s looking older,  said the gentleman of the bedchamber.",
      "From overwork.",
      "He s always drawing up projects nowadays.",
      "He won t let\na poor devil go nowadays till he s explained it all to him under\nheads.",
      "Looking older, did you say?",
      "_Il fait des passions_.",
      "I believe Countess\nLidia Ivanovna s jealous now of his wife.",
      "Oh, come now, please don t say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?",
      "But is it true Madame Karenina s here?",
      "Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg.",
      "I met her yesterday\nwith Alexey Vronsky, _bras dessous, bras dessous_, in the Morsky.",
      "_C est un homme qui n a pas_,...  the gentleman of the bedchamber was\nbeginning, but he stopped to make room, bowing, for a member of the\nImperial family to pass.",
      "Thus people talked incessantly of Alexey Alexandrovitch, finding fault\nwith him and laughing at him, while he, blocking up the way of the\nmember of the Imperial Council he had captured, was explaining to him\npoint by point his new financial project, never interrupting his\ndiscourse for an instant for fear he should escape.",
      "Almost at the same time that his wife left Alexey Alexandrovitch there\nhad come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an official the\nmoment when his upward career comes to a full stop.",
      "This full stop had\narrived and everyone perceived it, but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself\nwas not yet aware that his career was over.",
      "Whether it was due to his\nfeud with Stremov, or his misfortune with his wife, or simply that\nAlexey Alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits, it had become\nevident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at\nan end.",
      "He still filled a position of consequence, he sat on many\ncommissions and committees, but he was a man whose day was over, and\nfrom whom nothing was expected.",
      "Whatever he said, whatever he proposed,\nwas heard as though it were something long familiar, and the very thing\nthat was not needed.",
      "But Alexey Alexandrovitch was not aware of this,\nand, on the contrary, being cut off from direct participation in\ngovernmental activity, he saw more clearly than ever the errors and\ndefects in the action of others, and thought it his duty to point out\nmeans for their correction.",
      "Shortly after his separation from his wife,\nhe began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure, the\nfirst of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the\nfuture.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless\nposition in the official world, he was not merely free from anxiety on\nthis head, he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own\nactivity.",
      "He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord,\nhow he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the\nthings that are of the world, how he may please his wife,  says the\nApostle Paul, and Alexey Alexandrovitch, who was now guided in every\naction by Scripture, often recalled this text.",
      "It seemed to him that\never since he had been left without a wife, he had in these very\nprojects of reform been serving the Lord more zealously than before.",
      "The unmistakable impatience of the member of the Council trying to get\naway from him did not trouble Alexey Alexandrovitch; he gave up his\nexposition only when the member of the Council, seizing his chance when\none of the Imperial family was passing, slipped away from him.",
      "Left alone, Alexey Alexandrovitch looked down, collecting his thoughts,\nthen looked casually about him and walked towards the door, where he\nhoped to meet Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "And how strong they all are, how sound physically,  thought Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the\nbedchamber with his well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck\nof the prince, pinched by his tight uniform.",
      "He had to pass them on his\nway.",
      "Truly is it said that all the world is evil,  he thought, with\nanother sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the\nbedchamber.",
      "Moving forward deliberately, Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed with his\ncustomary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been\ntalking about him, and looking towards the door, his eyes sought\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Ah!",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "said the little old man, with a malicious\nlight in his eyes, at the moment when Karenin was on a level with them,\nand was nodding with a frigid gesture,  I haven t congratulated you\nyet,  said the old man, pointing to his newly received ribbon.",
      "Thank you,  answered Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "What an _exquisite_ day\ntoday,  he added, laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word\n_exquisite_.",
      "That they laughed at him he was well aware, but he did not expect\nanything but hostility from them; he was used to that by now.",
      "Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out\nabove her corset, and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her, Alexey\nAlexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went\ntowards her.",
      "Lidia Ivanovna s dress had cost her great pains, as indeed all her\ndresses had done of late.",
      "Her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of\nthat she had pursued thirty years before.",
      "Then her desire had been to\nadorn herself with something, and the more adorned the better.",
      "Now, on\nthe contrary, she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with\nher age and her figure, that her one anxiety was to contrive that the\ncontrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be\ntoo appalling.",
      "And as far as Alexey Alexandrovitch was concerned she\nsucceeded, and was in his eyes attractive.",
      "For him she was the one\nisland not only of goodwill to him, but of love in the midst of the sea\nof hostility and jeering that surrounded him.",
      "Passing through rows of ironical eyes, he was drawn as naturally to her\nloving glance as a plant to the sun.",
      "I congratulate you,  she said to him, her eyes on his ribbon.",
      "Suppressing a smile of pleasure, he shrugged his shoulders, closing his\neyes, as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his\nchief sources of satisfaction, though he never admitted it.",
      "How is our angel?",
      "said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, meaning Seryozha.",
      "I can t say I was quite pleased with him,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch,\nraising his eyebrows and opening his eyes.",
      "And Sitnikov is not\nsatisfied with him.",
      "(Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Seryozha s secular\neducation had been intrusted.)",
      "As I have mentioned to you, there s a\nsort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which\nought to touch the heart of every man and every child....  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that\ninterested him besides the service the education of his son.",
      "When Alexey Alexandrovitch with Lidia Ivanovna s help had been brought\nback anew to life and activity, he felt it his duty to undertake the\neducation of the son left on his hands.",
      "Having never before taken any\ninterest in educational questions, Alexey Alexandrovitch devoted some\ntime to the theoretical study of the subject.",
      "After reading several\nbooks on anthropology, education, and didactics, Alexey Alexandrovitch\ndrew up a plan of education, and engaging the best tutor in Petersburg\nto superintend it, he set to work, and the subject continually absorbed\nhim.",
      "Yes, but the heart.",
      "I see in him his father s heart, and with such a\nheart a child cannot go far wrong,  said Lidia Ivanovna with\nenthusiasm.",
      "Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty.",
      "It s all I can do.",
      "You re coming to me,  said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, after a pause;  we\nhave to speak of a subject painful for you.",
      "I would give anything to\nhave spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.",
      "I have received a letter from _her_.",
      "_She_ is here in Petersburg.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife, but\nimmediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed\nutter helplessness in the matter.",
      "I was expecting it,  he said.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and tears of\nrapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes.",
      "Chapter 25\n\nWhen Alexey Alexandrovitch came into the Countess Lidia Ivanovna s snug\nlittle boudoir, decorated with old china and hung with portraits, the\nlady herself had not yet made her appearance.",
      "She was changing her dress.",
      "A cloth was laid on a round table, and on it stood a china tea service\nand a silver spirit-lamp and tea kettle.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch looked\nidly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room,\nand sitting down to the table, he opened a New Testament lying upon it.",
      "The rustle of the countess s silk skirt drew his attention off.",
      "Well now, we can sit quietly,  said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, slipping\nhurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa,  and\ntalk over our tea.",
      "After some words of preparation, Countess Lidia Ivanovna, breathing\nhard and flushing crimson, gave into Alexey Alexandrovitch s hands the\nletter she had received.",
      "After reading the letter, he sat a long while in silence.",
      "I don t think I have the right to refuse her,  he said, timidly\nlifting his eyes.",
      "Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!",
      "On the contrary, I see that all is evil.",
      "But whether it is just.... \n\nHis face showed irresolution, and a seeking for counsel, support, and\nguidance in a matter he did not understand.",
      "No,  Countess Lidia Ivanovna interrupted him;  there are limits to\neverything.",
      "I can understand immorality,  she said, not quite\ntruthfully, since she never could understand that which leads women to\nimmorality;  but I don t understand cruelty: to whom?",
      "to you!",
      "How can\nshe stay in the town where you are?",
      "No, the longer one lives the more\none learns.",
      "And I m learning to understand your loftiness and her\nbaseness.",
      "Who is to throw a stone?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, unmistakably\npleased with the part he had to play.",
      "I have forgiven all, and so I\ncannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her by her love for\nher son....",
      "But is that love, my friend?",
      "Is it sincere?",
      "Admitting that you have\nforgiven that you forgive have we the right to work on the feelings of\nthat angel?",
      "He looks on her as dead.",
      "He prays for her, and beseeches\nGod to have mercy on her sins.",
      "And it is better so.",
      "But now what will\nhe think?",
      "I had not thought of that,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, evidently\nagreeing.",
      "Countess Lidia Ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent.",
      "She\nwas praying.",
      "If you ask my advice,  she said, having finished her prayer and\nuncovered her face,  I do not advise you to do this.",
      "Do you suppose I\ndon t see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?",
      "But supposing that, as always, you don t think of yourself, what can it\nlead to?",
      "to fresh suffering for you, to torture for the child.",
      "If there\nwere a trace of humanity left in her, she ought not to wish for it\nherself.",
      "No, I have no hesitation in saying I advise not, and if you\nwill intrust it to me, I will write to her.",
      "And Alexey Alexandrovitch consented, and Countess Lidia Ivanovna sent\nthe following letter in French:\n\n\n Dear Madame,\n\n To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to\nquestions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in\nthe child s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him\nsacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband s refusal in\nthe spirit of Christian love.",
      "I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on\nyou.",
      "Countess Lidia.",
      "This letter attained the secret object which Countess Lidia Ivanovna\nhad concealed from herself.",
      "It wounded Anna to the quick.",
      "For his part, Alexey Alexandrovitch, on returning home from Lidia\nIvanovna s, could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual\npursuits, and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing\nwhich he had felt of late.",
      "The thought of his wife, who had so greatly sinned against him, and\ntowards whom he had been so saintly, as Countess Lidia Ivanovna had so\njustly told him, ought not to have troubled him; but he was not easy;\nhe could not understand the book he was reading; he could not drive\naway harassing recollections of his relations with her, of the mistake\nwhich, as it now seemed, he had made in regard to her.",
      "The memory of\nhow he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from\nthe races (especially that he had insisted only on the observance of\nexternal decorum, and had not sent a challenge) tortured him like a\nremorse.",
      "He was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had\nwritten her; and most of all, his forgiveness, which nobody wanted, and\nhis care of the other man s child made his heart burn with shame and\nremorse.",
      "And just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now, as he\nreviewed all his past with her, recalling the awkward words in which,\nafter long wavering, he had made her an offer.",
      "But how have I been to blame?",
      "he said to himself.",
      "And this question\nalways excited another question in him whether they felt differently,\ndid their loving and marrying differently, these Vronskys and Oblonskys\n... these gentlemen of the bedchamber, with their fine calves.",
      "And\nthere passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome,\nvigorous, self-confident men, who always and everywhere drew his\ninquisitive attention in spite of himself.",
      "He tried to dispel these\nthoughts, he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this\ntransient life, but for the life of eternity, and that there was peace\nand love in his heart.",
      "But the fact that he had in this transient, trivial life made, as it\nseemed to him, a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the\neternal salvation in which he believed had no existence.",
      "But this\ntemptation did not last long, and soon there was reestablished once\nmore in Alexey Alexandrovitch s soul the peace and the elevation by\nvirtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember.",
      "Chapter 26\n\n Well, Kapitonitch?",
      "said Seryozha, coming back rosy and good-humored\nfrom his walk the day before his birthday, and giving his overcoat to\nthe tall old hall-porter, who smiled down at the little person from the\nheight of his long figure.",
      "Well, has the bandaged clerk been here\ntoday?",
      "Did papa see him?",
      "He saw him.",
      "The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced him, \nsaid the hall-porter with a good-humored wink.",
      "Here, I ll take it\noff.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "said the tutor, stopping in the doorway leading to the\ninner rooms.",
      "Take it off yourself.",
      "But Seryozha, though he heard his\ntutor s feeble voice, did not pay attention to it.",
      "He stood keeping\nhold of the hall-porter s belt, and gazing into his face.",
      "Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?",
      "The hall-porter nodded his head affirmatively.",
      "The clerk with his face\ntied up, who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, interested both Seryozha and the hall-porter.",
      "Seryozha\nhad come upon him in the hall, and had heard him plaintively beg the\nhall-porter to announce him, saying that he and his children had death\nstaring them in the face.",
      "Since then Seryozha, having met him a second time in the hall, took\ngreat interest in him.",
      "Well, was he very glad?",
      "he asked.",
      "Glad?",
      "I should think so!",
      "Almost dancing as he walked away.",
      "And has anything been left?",
      "asked Seryozha, after a pause.",
      "Come, sir,  said the hall-porter; then with a shake of his head he\nwhispered,  Something from the countess.",
      "Seryozha understood at once that what the hall-porter was speaking of\nwas a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday.",
      "What do you say?",
      "Where?",
      "Korney took it to your papa.",
      "A fine plaything it must be too!",
      "How big?",
      "Like this?",
      "Rather small, but a fine thing.",
      "A book.",
      "No, a thing.",
      "Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling you, \nsaid the porter, hearing the tutor s steps approaching, and carefully\ntaking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off,\nhe signed with his head towards the tutor.",
      "Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!",
      "answered Seryozha with that gay\nand loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily\nLukitch.",
      "Seryozha was too happy, everything was too delightful for him to be\nable to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune\nof which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia\nIvanovna s niece.",
      "This piece of good news seemed to him particularly\nimportant from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the\nbandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him.",
      "It\nseemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be\nglad and happy.",
      "You know papa s received the Alexander Nevsky today?",
      "To be sure I do!",
      "People have been already to congratulate him.",
      "And is he glad?",
      "Glad at the Tsar s gracious favor!",
      "I should think so!",
      "It s a proof\nhe s deserved it,  said the porter severely and seriously.",
      "Seryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which\nhe had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that\nhung down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha,\nwho saw him only from below.",
      "Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?",
      "The porter s daughter was a ballet dancer.",
      "When is she to come on week-days?",
      "They ve their lessons to learn too.",
      "And you ve your lesson, sir; run along.",
      "On coming into the room, Seryozha, instead of sitting down to his\nlessons, told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought\nhim must be a machine.",
      "What do you think?",
      "he inquired.",
      "But Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of\nlearning the grammar lesson for the teacher, who was coming at two.",
      "No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch,  he asked suddenly, when he was\nseated at their work table with the book in his hands,  what is greater\nthan the Alexander Nevsky?",
      "You know papa s received the Alexander\nNevsky?",
      "Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the\nAlexander Nevsky.",
      "And higher still?",
      "Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.",
      "And higher than the Andrey?",
      "I don t know.",
      "What, you don t know?",
      "and Seryozha, leaning on his elbows, sank into\ndeep meditation.",
      "His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character.",
      "He\nimagined his father s having suddenly been presented with both the\nVladimir and the Andrey today, and in consequence being much better\ntempered at his lesson, and dreamed how, when he was grown up, he would\nhimself receive all the orders, and what they might invent higher than\nthe Andrey.",
      "Directly any higher order were invented, he would win it.",
      "They would make a higher one still, and he would immediately win that\ntoo.",
      "The time passed in such meditations, and when the teacher came, the\nlesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not\nready, and the teacher was not only displeased, but hurt.",
      "This touched\nSeryozha.",
      "He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the\nlesson; however much he tried, he was utterly unable to do that.",
      "As\nlong as the teacher was explaining to him, he believed him and seemed\nto comprehend, but as soon as he was left alone, he was positively\nunable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word\n suddenly  is an adverb of manner of action.",
      "Still he was sorry that he\nhad disappointed the teacher.",
      "He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book.",
      "Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?",
      "he asked all, of a sudden.",
      "You d much better be thinking about your work.",
      "Birthdays are of no\nimportance to a rational being.",
      "It s a day like any other on which one\nhas to do one s work.",
      "Seryozha looked intently at the teacher, at his scanty beard, at his\nspectacles, which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose, and\nfell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher\nwas explaining to him.",
      "He knew that the teacher did not think what he\nsaid; he felt it from the tone in which it was said.",
      "But why have they\nall agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and\nmost useless stuff?",
      "Why does he keep me off; why doesn t he love me?",
      "he asked himself mournfully, and could not think of an answer.",
      "Chapter 27\n\nAfter the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father s lesson.",
      "While waiting for his father, Seryozha sat at the table playing with a\npenknife, and fell to dreaming.",
      "Among Seryozha s favorite occupations\nwas searching for his mother during his walks.",
      "He did not believe in\ndeath generally, and in her death in particular, in spite of what Lidia\nIvanovna had told him and his father had confirmed, and it was just\nbecause of that, and after he had been told she was dead, that he had\nbegun looking for her when out for a walk.",
      "Every woman of full,\ngraceful figure with dark hair was his mother.",
      "At the sight of such a\nwoman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his\nbreath failed him, and tears came into his eyes.",
      "And he was on the\ntiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him, would lift her\nveil.",
      "All her face would be visible, she would smile, she would hug\nhim, he would sniff her fragrance, feel the softness of her arms, and\ncry with happiness, just as he had one evening lain on her lap while\nshe tickled him, and he laughed and bit her white, ring-covered\nfingers.",
      "Later, when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that\nhis mother was not dead, and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had\nexplained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked (which\nhe could not possibly believe, because he loved her), he went on\nseeking her and expecting her in the same way.",
      "That day in the public\ngardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil, whom he had watched with\na throbbing heart, believing it to be she as she came towards them\nalong the path.",
      "The lady had not come up to them, but had disappeared\nsomewhere.",
      "That day, more intensely than ever, Seryozha felt a rush of\nlove for her, and now, waiting for his father, he forgot everything,\nand cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife, staring\nstraight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her.",
      "Here is your papa!",
      "said Vassily Lukitch, rousing him.",
      "Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father, and kissing his hand,\nlooked at him intently, trying to discover signs of his joy at\nreceiving the Alexander Nevsky.",
      "Did you have a nice walk?",
      "said Alexey Alexandrovitch, sitting down in\nhis easy chair, pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him and\nopening it.",
      "Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told\nSeryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history\nthoroughly, he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson,\nand Seryozha observed this.",
      "Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa,  said Seryozha, sitting sideways\non his chair and rocking it, which was forbidden.",
      "I saw Nadinka \n(Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna s who was being brought up in\nher house).",
      "She told me you d been given a new star.",
      "Are you glad,\npapa?",
      "First of all, don t rock your chair, please,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "And secondly, it s not the reward that s precious, but\nthe work itself.",
      "And I could have wished you understood that.",
      "If you\nnow are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work\nwill seem hard to you; but when you work  (Alexey Alexandrovitch, as he\nspoke, thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through\nthe wearisome labor of the morning, consisting of signing one hundred\nand eighty papers),  loving your work, you will find your reward in\nit.",
      "Seryozha s eyes, that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness, grew\ndull and dropped before his father s gaze.",
      "This was the same\nlong-familiar tone his father always took with him, and Seryozha had\nlearned by now to fall in with it.",
      "His father always talked to him so\nSeryozha felt as though he were addressing some boy of his own\nimagination, one of those boys that exist in books, utterly unlike\nhimself.",
      "And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the\nstory-book boy.",
      "You understand that, I hope?",
      "said his father.",
      "Yes, papa,  answered Seryozha, acting the part of the imaginary boy.",
      "The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the\nGospel and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament.",
      "The\nverses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well, but at the moment\nwhen he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply\nprotruding, bony knobbiness of his father s forehead, that he lost the\nthread, and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of\nanother.",
      "So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not\nunderstand what he was saying, and that irritated him.",
      "He frowned, and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times\nbefore and never could remember, because he understood it too well,\njust as that  suddenly  is an adverb of manner of action.",
      "Seryozha\nlooked with scared eyes at his father, and could think of nothing but\nwhether his father would make him repeat what he had said, as he\nsometimes did.",
      "And this thought so alarmed Seryozha that he now\nunderstood nothing.",
      "But his father did not make him repeat it, and\npassed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament.",
      "Seryozha recounted\nthe events themselves well enough, but when he had to answer questions\nas to what certain events prefigured, he knew nothing, though he had\nalready been punished over this lesson.",
      "The passage at which he was\nutterly unable to say anything, and began fidgeting and cutting the\ntable and swinging his chair, was where he had to repeat the patriarchs\nbefore the Flood.",
      "He did not know one of them, except Enoch, who had\nbeen taken up alive to heaven.",
      "Last time he had remembered their names,\nbut now he had forgotten them utterly, chiefly because Enoch was the\npersonage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament, and Enoch s\ntranslation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train\nof thought, in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with\nfascinated eyes at his father s watch-chain and a half-unbuttoned\nbutton on his waistcoat.",
      "In death, of which they talked to him so often, Seryozha disbelieved\nentirely.",
      "He did not believe that those he loved could die, above all\nthat he himself would die.",
      "That was to him something utterly\ninconceivable and impossible.",
      "But he had been told that all men die; he\nhad asked people, indeed, whom he trusted, and they too, had confirmed\nit; his old nurse, too, said the same, though reluctantly.",
      "But Enoch\nhad not died, and so it followed that everyone did not die.",
      "And why\ncannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?",
      "thought\nSeryozha.",
      "Bad people, that is those Seryozha did not like, they might\ndie, but the good might all be like Enoch.",
      "Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?",
      "Enoch, Enos \n\n But you have said that already.",
      "This is bad, Seryozha, very bad.",
      "If\nyou don t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a\nChristian,  said his father, getting up,  whatever can interest you?",
      "I\nam displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch  (this was the most\nimportant of his teachers)  is displeased with you....",
      "I shall have to\npunish you.",
      "His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and he\ncertainly did learn his lessons very badly.",
      "But still it could not be\nsaid he was a stupid boy.",
      "On the contrary, he was far cleverer than the\nboys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha.",
      "In his father s\nopinion, he did not want to learn what he was taught.",
      "In reality he\ncould not learn that.",
      "He could not, because the claims of his own soul\nwere more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher\nmade upon him.",
      "Those claims were in opposition, and he was in direct\nconflict with his education.",
      "He was nine years old; he was a child; but\nhe knew his own soul, it was precious to him, he guarded it as the\neyelid guards the eye, and without the key of love he let no one into\nhis soul.",
      "His teachers complained that he would not learn, while his\nsoul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge.",
      "And he learned from\nKapitonitch, from his nurse, from Nadinka, from Vassily Lukitch, but\nnot from his teachers.",
      "The spring his father and his teachers reckoned\nupon to turn their mill-wheels had long dried up at the source, but its\nwaters did their work in another channel.",
      "His father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka,\nLidia Ivanovna s niece; but this punishment turned out happily for\nSeryozha.",
      "Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor, and showed him how to\nmake windmills.",
      "The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming\nhow to make a windmill on which he could turn himself clutching at the\nsails or tying himself on and whirling round.",
      "Of his mother Seryozha\ndid not think all the evening, but when he had gone to bed, he suddenly\nremembered her, and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow\nfor his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him.",
      "Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides\nthe regular things?",
      "That you might learn your lessons better?",
      "No.",
      "Toys?",
      "No.",
      "You ll never guess.",
      "A splendid thing; but it s a secret!",
      "When it\ncomes to pass I ll tell you.",
      "Can t you guess!",
      "No, I can t guess.",
      "You tell me,  said Vassily Lukitch with a smile,\nwhich was rare with him.",
      "Come, lie down, I m putting out the candle.",
      "Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for.",
      "There!",
      "I was almost telling the secret!",
      "said Seryozha, laughing gaily.",
      "When the candle was taken away, Seryozha heard and felt his mother.",
      "She\nstood over him, and with loving eyes caressed him.",
      "But then came\nwindmills, a knife, everything began to be mixed up, and he fell\nasleep.",
      "Chapter 28\n\nOn arriving in Petersburg, Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best\nhotels; Vronsky apart in a lower story, Anna above with her child, its\nnurse, and her maid, in a large suite of four rooms.",
      "On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother s. There he found\nhis mother, who had come from Moscow on business.",
      "His mother and\nsister-in-law greeted him as usual: they asked him about his stay\nabroad, and talked of their common acquaintances, but did not let drop\na single word in allusion to his connection with Anna.",
      "His brother came\nthe next morning to see Vronsky, and of his own accord asked him about\nher, and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his\nconnection with Madame Karenina as marriage; that he hoped to arrange a\ndivorce, and then to marry her, and until then he considered her as\nmuch a wife as any other wife, and he begged him to tell their mother\nand his wife so.",
      "If the world disapproves, I don t care,  said Vronsky;  but if my\nrelations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have\nto be on the same terms with my wife.",
      "The elder brother, who had always a respect for his younger brother s\njudgment, could not well tell whether he was right or not till the\nworld had decided the question; for his part he had nothing against it,\nand with Alexey he went up to see Anna.",
      "Before his brother, as before everyone, Vronsky addressed Anna with a\ncertain formality, treating her as he might a very intimate friend, but\nit was understood that his brother knew their real relations, and they\ntalked about Anna s going to Vronsky s estate.",
      "In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was, in consequence of\nthe new position in which he was placed, laboring under a strange\nmisapprehension.",
      "One would have thought he must have understood that\nsociety was closed for him and Anna; but now some vague ideas had\nsprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old-fashioned\ndays, and that now with the rapidity of modern progress (he had\nunconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress) the\nviews of society had changed, and that the question whether they would\nbe received in society was not a foregone conclusion.",
      "Of course,  he\nthought,  she would not be received at court, but intimate friends can\nand must look at it in the proper light.",
      "One may sit for several hours\nat a stretch with one s legs crossed in the same position, if one knows\nthat there s nothing to prevent one s changing one s position; but if a\nman knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs, then cramps\ncome on, the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to\nwhich one would like to draw them.",
      "This was what Vronsky was\nexperiencing in regard to the world.",
      "Though at the bottom of his heart\nhe knew that the world was shut on them, he put it to the test whether\nthe world had not changed by now and would not receive them.",
      "But he\nvery quickly perceived that though the world was open for him\npersonally, it was closed for Anna.",
      "Just as in the game of cat and\nmouse, the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for Anna.",
      "One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his\ncousin Betsy.",
      "At last!",
      "she greeted him joyfully.",
      "And Anna?",
      "How glad I am!",
      "Where\nare you stopping?",
      "I can fancy after your delightful travels you must\nfind our poor Petersburg horrid.",
      "I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.",
      "How about the divorce?",
      "Is that all over?",
      "Vronsky noticed that Betsy s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no\ndivorce had as yet taken place.",
      "People will throw stones at me, I know,  she said,  but I shall come\nand see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come.",
      "You won t be here long, I\nsuppose?",
      "And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day, but her tone was\nnot at all the same as in former days.",
      "She unmistakably prided herself\non her courage, and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her\nfriendship.",
      "She only stayed ten minutes, talking of society gossip, and\non leaving she said:\n\n You ve never told me when the divorce is to be?",
      "Supposing I m ready to\nfling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will give you the cold\nshoulder until you re married.",
      "And that s so simple nowadays.",
      "_ a se\nfait_.",
      "So you re going on Friday?",
      "Sorry we shan t see each other\nagain.",
      "From Betsy s tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from\nthe world; but he made another effort in his own family.",
      "His mother he\ndid not reckon upon.",
      "He knew that his mother, who had been so\nenthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance, would have no mercy\non her now for having ruined her son s career.",
      "But he had more hope of\nVarya, his brother s wife.",
      "He fancied she would not throw stones, and\nwould go simply and directly to see Anna, and would receive her in her\nown house.",
      "The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her, and finding her alone,\nexpressed his wishes directly.",
      "You know, Alexey,  she said after hearing him,  how fond I am of you,\nand how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken,\nbecause I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna,  she\nsaid, articulating the name  Anna Arkadyevna  with particular care.",
      "Don t suppose, please, that I judge her.",
      "Never; perhaps in her place I\nshould have done the same.",
      "I don t and can t enter into that,  she\nsaid, glancing timidly at his gloomy face.",
      "But one must call things by\ntheir names.",
      "You want me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to\nrehabilitate her in society; but do understand that _I cannot_ do so.",
      "I\nhave daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my\nhusband s sake.",
      "Well, I m ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she\nwill understand that I can t ask her here, or I should have to do so in\nsuch a way that she would not meet people who look at things\ndifferently; that would offend her.",
      "I can t raise her.... \n\n Oh, I don t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do\nreceive!",
      "Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily, and he got up in\nsilence, understanding that his sister-in-law s decision was not to be\nshaken.",
      "Alexey!",
      "don t be angry with me.",
      "Please understand that I m not to\nblame,  began Varya, looking at him with a timid smile.",
      "I m not angry with you,  he said still as gloomily;  but I m sorry in\ntwo ways.",
      "I m sorry, too, that this means breaking up our friendship if\nnot breaking up, at least weakening it.",
      "You will understand that for\nme, too, it cannot be otherwise.",
      "And with that he left her.",
      "Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless, and that he had to\nspend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town,\navoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to\nbe exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable\nto him.",
      "One of the most unpleasant features of his position in\nPetersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet\nhim everywhere.",
      "He could not begin to talk of anything without the\nconversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch; he could not go anywhere\nwithout risk of meeting him.",
      "So at least it seemed to Vronsky, just as\nit seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually, as though\non purpose, grazing his sore finger on everything.",
      "Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he\nperceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand\nin Anna.",
      "At one time she would seem in love with him, and then she\nwould become cold, irritable, and impenetrable.",
      "She was worrying over\nsomething, and keeping something back from him, and did not seem to\nnotice the humiliations which poisoned his existence, and for her, with\nher delicate intuition, must have been still more unbearable.",
      "Chapter 29\n\nOne of Anna s objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her son.",
      "From the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to\nagitate her.",
      "And as she got nearer to Petersburg, the delight and\nimportance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination.",
      "She\ndid not even put to herself the question how to arrange it.",
      "It seemed\nto her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same\ntown with him.",
      "But on her arrival in Petersburg she was suddenly made\ndistinctly aware of her present position in society, and she grasped\nthe fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter.",
      "She had now been two days in Petersburg.",
      "The thought of her son never\nleft her for a single instant, but she had not yet seen him.",
      "To go\nstraight to the house, where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch, that\nshe felt she had no right to do.",
      "She might be refused admittance and\ninsulted.",
      "To write and so enter into relations with her husband that it\nmade her miserable to think of doing; she could only be at peace when\nshe did not think of her husband.",
      "To get a glimpse of her son out\nwalking, finding out where and when he went out, was not enough for\nher; she had so looked forward to this meeting, she had so much she\nmust say to him, she so longed to embrace him, to kiss him.",
      "Seryozha s\nold nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do.",
      "But the nurse\nwas not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch s house.",
      "In this\nuncertainty, and in efforts to find the nurse, two days had slipped by.",
      "Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna, Anna decided on the third day to write to her\na letter, which cost her great pains, and in which she intentionally\nsaid that permission to see her son must depend on her husband s\ngenerosity.",
      "She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband, he\nwould keep up his character of magnanimity, and would not refuse her\nrequest.",
      "The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most\ncruel and unexpected answer, that there was no answer.",
      "She had never\nfelt so humiliated as at the moment when, sending for the\ncommissionaire, she heard from him the exact account of how he had\nwaited, and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer.",
      "Anna\nfelt humiliated, insulted, but she saw that from her point of view\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna was right.",
      "Her suffering was the more poignant\nthat she had to bear it in solitude.",
      "She could not and would not share\nit with Vronsky.",
      "She knew that to him, although he was the primary\ncause of her distress, the question of her seeing her son would seem a\nmatter of very little consequence.",
      "She knew that he would never be\ncapable of understanding all the depth of her suffering, that for his\ncool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him.",
      "And she\ndreaded that more than anything in the world, and so she hid from him\neverything that related to her son.",
      "Spending the whole day at home she\nconsidered ways of seeing her son, and had reached a decision to write\nto her husband.",
      "She was just composing this letter when she was handed\nthe letter from Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "The countess s silence had subdued and\ndepressed her, but the letter, all that she read between the lines in\nit, so exasperated her, this malice was so revolting beside her\npassionate, legitimate tenderness for her son, that she turned against\nother people and left off blaming herself.",
      "This coldness this pretense of feeling!",
      "she said to herself.",
      "They\nmust needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to submit to it!",
      "Not on any consideration!",
      "She is worse than I am.",
      "I don t lie, anyway.",
      "And she decided on the spot that next day, Seryozha s birthday, she\nwould go straight to her husband s house, bribe or deceive the\nservants, but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous\ndeception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child.",
      "She went to a toy shop, bought toys and thought over a plan of action.",
      "She would go early in the morning at eight o clock, when Alexey\nAlexandrovitch would be certain not to be up.",
      "She would have money in\nher hand to give the hall-porter and the footman, so that they should\nlet her in, and not raising her veil, she would say that she had come\nfrom Seryozha s godfather to congratulate him, and that she had been\ncharged to leave the toys at his bedside.",
      "She had prepared everything\nbut the words she should say to her son.",
      "Often as she had dreamed of\nit, she could never think of anything.",
      "The next day, at eight o clock in the morning, Anna got out of a hired\nsledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home.",
      "Run and see what s wanted.",
      "Some lady,  said Kapitonitch, who, not yet\ndressed, in his overcoat and galoshes, had peeped out of the window and\nseen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door.",
      "His assistant, a\nlad Anna did not know, had no sooner opened the door to her than she\ncame in, and pulling a three-rouble note out of her muff put it\nhurriedly into his hand.",
      "Seryozha Sergey Alexeitch,  she said, and was going on.",
      "Scrutinizing\nthe note, the porter s assistant stopped her at the second glass door.",
      "Whom do you want?",
      "he asked.",
      "She did not hear his words and made no answer.",
      "Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady, Kapitonitch went out to\nher, opened the second door for her, and asked her what she was pleased\nto want.",
      "From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch,  she said.",
      "His honor s not up yet,  said the porter, looking at her attentively.",
      "Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the\nhouse where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her.",
      "Memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart, and for\na moment she forgot what she was here for.",
      "Would you kindly wait?",
      "said Kapitonitch, taking off her fur cloak.",
      "As he took off the cloak, Kapitonitch glanced at her face, recognized\nher, and made her a low bow in silence.",
      "Please walk in, your excellency,  he said to her.",
      "She tried to say something, but her voice refused to utter any sound;\nwith a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light,\nswift steps up the stairs.",
      "Bent double, and his galoshes catching in\nthe steps, Kapitonitch ran after her, trying to overtake her.",
      "The tutor s there; maybe he s not dressed.",
      "I ll let him know.",
      "Anna still mounted the familiar staircase, not understanding what the\nold man was saying.",
      "This way, to the left, if you please.",
      "Excuse its not being tidy.",
      "His\nhonor s in the old parlor now,  the hall-porter said, panting.",
      "Excuse\nme, wait a little, your excellency; I ll just see,  he said, and\novertaking her, he opened the high door and disappeared behind it.",
      "Anna\nstood still waiting.",
      "He s only just awake,  said the hall-porter,\ncoming out.",
      "And at the very instant the porter said this, Anna caught\nthe sound of a childish yawn.",
      "From the sound of this yawn alone she\nknew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes.",
      "Let me in; go away!",
      "she said, and went in through the high doorway.",
      "On the right of the door stood a bed, and sitting up in the bed was the\nboy.",
      "His little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned, he\nwas stretching and still yawning.",
      "The instant his lips came together\nthey curved into a blissfully sleepy smile, and with that smile he\nslowly and deliciously rolled back again.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "she whispered, going noiselessly up to him.",
      "When she was parted from him, and all this latter time when she had\nbeen feeling a fresh rush of love for him, she had pictured him as he\nwas at four years old, when she had loved him most of all.",
      "Now he was\nnot even the same as when she had left him; he was still further from\nthe four-year-old baby, more grown and thinner.",
      "How thin his face was,\nhow short his hair was!",
      "What long hands!",
      "How he had changed since she\nleft him!",
      "But it was he with his head, his lips, his soft neck and\nbroad little shoulders.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "she repeated just in the child s ear.",
      "He raised himself again on his elbow, turned his tangled head from side\nto side as though looking for something, and opened his eyes.",
      "Slowly\nand inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing\nmotionless before him, then all at once he smiled a blissful smile, and\nshutting his eyes, rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "my darling boy!",
      "she said, breathing hard and putting her\narms round his plump little body.",
      "Mother!",
      "he said, wriggling about in\nher arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him.",
      "Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes, he flung fat little arms round\nher shoulders, rolled towards her, with the delicious sleepy warmth and\nfragrance that is only found in children, and began rubbing his face\nagainst her neck and shoulders.",
      "I know,  he said, opening his eyes;  it s my birthday today.",
      "I knew\nyou d come.",
      "I ll get up directly.",
      "And saying that he dropped asleep.",
      "Anna looked at him hungrily; she saw how he had grown and changed in\nher absence.",
      "She knew, and did not know, the bare legs so long now,\nthat were thrust out below the quilt, those short-cropped curls on his\nneck in which she had so often kissed him.",
      "She touched all this and\ncould say nothing; tears choked her.",
      "What are you crying for, mother?",
      "he said, waking completely up.",
      "Mother, what are you crying for?",
      "he cried in a tearful voice.",
      "I won t cry ...",
      "I m crying for joy.",
      "It s so long since I ve seen you.",
      "I won t, I won t,  she said, gulping down her tears and turning away.",
      "Come, it s time for you to dress now,  she added, after a pause, and,\nnever letting go his hands, she sat down by his bedside on the chair,\nwhere his clothes were put ready for him.",
      "How do you dress without me?",
      "How....  she tried to begin talking\nsimply and cheerfully, but she could not, and again she turned away.",
      "I don t have a cold bath, papa didn t order it.",
      "And you ve not seen\nVassily Lukitch?",
      "He ll come in soon.",
      "Why, you re sitting on my\nclothes!",
      "And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter.",
      "She looked at him and\nsmiled.",
      "Mother, darling, sweet one!",
      "he shouted, flinging himself on her again\nand hugging her.",
      "It was as though only now, on seeing her smile, he\nfully grasped what had happened.",
      "I don t want that on,  he said, taking off her hat.",
      "And as it were,\nseeing her afresh without her hat, he fell to kissing her again.",
      "But what did you think about me?",
      "You didn t think I was dead?",
      "I never believed it.",
      "You didn t believe it, my sweet?",
      "I knew, I knew!",
      "he repeated his favorite phrase, and snatching the\nhand that was stroking his hair, he pressed the open palm to his mouth\nand kissed it.",
      "Chapter 30\n\nMeanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady\nwas, and had learned from their conversation that it was no other\nperson than the mother who had left her husband, and whom he had not\nseen, as he had entered the house after her departure.",
      "He was in doubt\nwhether to go in or not, or whether to communicate with Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Reflecting finally that his duty was to get Seryozha up\nat the hour fixed, and that it was therefore not his business to\nconsider who was there, the mother or anyone else, but simply to do his\nduty, he finished dressing, went to the door and opened it.",
      "But the embraces of the mother and child, the sound of their voices,\nand what they were saying, made him change his mind.",
      "He shook his head, and with a sigh he closed the door.",
      "I ll wait\nanother ten minutes,  he said to himself, clearing his throat and\nwiping away tears.",
      "Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all\nthis time.",
      "All had heard that their mistress had come, and that\nKapitonitch had let her in, and that she was even now in the nursery,\nand that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine\no clock, and everyone fully comprehended that it was impossible for the\nhusband and wife to meet, and that they must prevent it.",
      "Korney, the\nvalet, going down to the hall-porter s room, asked who had let her in,\nand how it was he had done so, and ascertaining that Kapitonitch had\nadmitted her and shown her up, he gave the old man a talking-to.",
      "The\nhall-porter was doggedly silent, but when Korney told him he ought to\nbe sent away, Kapitonitch darted up to him, and waving his hands in\nKorney s face, began:\n\n Oh yes, to be sure you d not have let her in!",
      "After ten years \nservice, and never a word but of kindness, and there you d up and say,\n Be off, go along, get away with you!",
      "Oh yes, you re a shrewd one at\npolitics, I dare say!",
      "You don t need to be taught how to swindle the\nmaster, and to filch fur coats!",
      "Soldier!",
      "said Korney contemptuously, and he turned to the nurse who\nwas coming in.",
      "Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna: he let her in\nwithout a word to anyone,  Korney said addressing her.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch will be down immediately and go into the nursery!",
      "A pretty business, a pretty business!",
      "said the nurse.",
      "You, Korney\nVassilievitch, you d best keep him some way or other, the master, while\nI ll run and get her away somehow.",
      "A pretty business!",
      "When the nurse went into the nursery, Seryozha was telling his mother\nhow he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill, and had turned\nover three times.",
      "She was listening to the sound of his voice, watching\nhis face and the play of expression on it, touching his hand, but she\ndid not follow what he was saying.",
      "She must go, she must leave\nhim, this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling.",
      "She heard\nthe steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing; she\nheard, too, the steps of the nurse as she came near; but she sat like\none turned to stone, incapable of beginning to speak or to get up.",
      "Mistress, darling!",
      "began the nurse, going up to Anna and kissing her\nhands and shoulders.",
      "God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his\nbirthday.",
      "You aren t changed one bit.",
      "Oh, nurse dear, I didn t know you were in the house,  said Anna,\nrousing herself for a moment.",
      "I m not living here, I m living with my daughter.",
      "I came for the\nbirthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!",
      "The nurse suddenly burst into tears, and began kissing her hand again.",
      "Seryozha, with radiant eyes and smiles, holding his mother by one hand\nand his nurse by the other, pattered on the rug with his fat little\nbare feet.",
      "The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother\nthrew him into an ecstasy.",
      "Mother!",
      "She often comes to see me, and when she comes....  he was\nbeginning, but he stopped, noticing that the nurse was saying something\nin a whisper to his mother, and that in his mother s face there was a\nlook of dread and something like shame, which was so strangely\nunbecoming to her.",
      "She went up to him.",
      "My sweet!",
      "she said.",
      "She could not say _good-bye_, but the expression on her face said it,\nand he understood.",
      "Darling, darling Kootik!",
      "she used the name by\nwhich she had called him when he was little,  you won t forget me?",
      "You....  but she could not say more.",
      "How often afterwards she thought of words she might have said.",
      "But now\nshe did not know how to say it, and could say nothing.",
      "But Seryozha\nknew all she wanted to say to him.",
      "He understood that she was unhappy\nand loved him.",
      "He understood even what the nurse had whispered.",
      "He had\ncaught the words  always at nine o clock,  and he knew that this was\nsaid of his father, and that his father and mother could not meet.",
      "That\nhe understood, but one thing he could not understand why there should\nbe a look of dread and shame in her face?...",
      "She was not in fault, but\nshe was afraid of him and ashamed of something.",
      "He would have liked to\nput a question that would have set at rest this doubt, but he did not\ndare; he saw that she was miserable, and he felt for her.",
      "Silently he\npressed close to her and whispered,  Don t go yet.",
      "He won t come just\nyet.",
      "The mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking, what to\nsay to him, and in his frightened face she read not only that he was\nspeaking of his father, but, as it were, asking her what he ought to\nthink about his father.",
      "Seryozha, my darling,  she said,  love him; he s better and kinder\nthan I am, and I have done him wrong.",
      "When you grow up you will judge.",
      "There s no one better than you!...",
      "he cried in despair through his\ntears, and, clutching her by the shoulders, he began squeezing her with\nall his force to him, his arms trembling with the strain.",
      "My sweet, my little one!",
      "said Anna, and she cried as weakly and\nchildishly as he.",
      "At that moment the door opened.",
      "Vassily Lukitch came in.",
      "At the other door there was the sound of steps, and the nurse in a\nscared whisper said,  He s coming,  and gave Anna her hat.",
      "Seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed, hiding his face in his hands.",
      "Anna removed his hands, once more kissed his wet face, and with rapid\nsteps went to the door.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in, meeting her.",
      "Seeing her, he stopped short and bowed his head.",
      "Although she had just said he was better and kinder than she, in the\nrapid glance she flung at him, taking in his whole figure in all its\ndetails, feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her\nson took possession of her.",
      "With a swift gesture she put down her veil,\nand, quickening her pace, almost ran out of the room.",
      "She had not time to undo, and so carried back with her, the parcel of\ntoys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and\nsorrow.",
      "Chapter 31\n\nAs intensely as Anna had longed to see her son, and long as she had\nbeen thinking of it and preparing herself for it, she had not in the\nleast expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply.",
      "On getting\nback to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while\nunderstand why she was there.",
      "Yes, it s all over, and I am again\nalone,  she said to herself, and without taking off her hat she sat\ndown in a low chair by the hearth.",
      "Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock\nstanding on a table between the windows, she tried to think.",
      "The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should\ndress.",
      "She gazed at her wonderingly and said,  Presently.",
      "A footman\noffered her coffee.",
      "Later on,  she said.",
      "The Italian nurse, after having taken the baby out in her best, came in\nwith her, and brought her to Anna.",
      "The plump, well-fed little baby, on\nseeing her mother, as she always did, held out her fat little hands,\nand with a smile on her toothless mouth, began, like a fish with a\nfloat, bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her\nembroidered skirt, making them rustle.",
      "It was impossible not to smile,\nnot to kiss the baby, impossible not to hold out a finger for her to\nclutch, crowing and prancing all over; impossible not to offer her a\nlip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss.",
      "And all\nthis Anna did, and took her in her arms and made her dance, and kissed\nher fresh little cheek and bare little elbows; but at the sight of this\nchild it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her\ncould not be called love in comparison with what she felt for Seryozha.",
      "Everything in this baby was charming, but for some reason all this did\nnot go deep to her heart.",
      "On her first child, though the child of an\nunloved father, had been concentrated all the love that had never found\nsatisfaction.",
      "Her baby girl had been born in the most painful\ncircumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought\nwhich had been concentrated on her first child.",
      "Besides, in the little\ngirl everything was still in the future, while Seryozha was by now\nalmost a personality, and a personality dearly loved.",
      "In him there was\na conflict of thought and feeling; he understood her, he loved her, he\njudged her, she thought, recalling his words and his eyes.",
      "And she was\nforever not physically only but spiritually divided from him, and it\nwas impossible to set this right.",
      "She gave the baby back to the nurse, let her go, and opened the locket\nin which there was Seryozha s portrait when he was almost of the same\nage as the girl.",
      "She got up, and, taking off her hat, took up from a\nlittle table an album in which there were photographs of her son at\ndifferent ages.",
      "She wanted to compare them, and began taking them out\nof the album.",
      "She took them all out except one, the latest and best\nphotograph.",
      "In it he was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair,\nwith frowning eyes and smiling lips.",
      "It was his best, most\ncharacteristic expression.",
      "With her little supple hands, her white,\ndelicate fingers, that moved with a peculiar intensity today, she\npulled at a corner of the photograph, but the photograph had caught\nsomewhere, and she could not get it out.",
      "There was no paper-knife on\nthe table, and so, pulling out the photograph that was next to her\nson s (it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and\nwith long hair), she used it to push out her son s photograph.",
      "Oh,\nhere is he!",
      "she said, glancing at the portrait of Vronsky, and she\nsuddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery.",
      "She had\nnot once thought of him all the morning.",
      "But now, coming all at once\nupon that manly, noble face, so familiar and so dear to her, she felt a\nsudden rush of love for him.",
      "But where is he?",
      "How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?",
      "she\nthought all at once with a feeling of reproach, forgetting she had\nherself kept from him everything concerning her son.",
      "She sent to ask\nhim to come to her immediately; with a throbbing heart she awaited him,\nrehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all, and\nthe expressions of love with which he would console her.",
      "The messenger\nreturned with the answer that he had a visitor with him, but that he\nwould come immediately, and that he asked whether she would let him\nbring with him Prince Yashvin, who had just arrived in Petersburg.",
      "He s not coming alone, and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me, \nshe thought;  he s not coming so that I could tell him everything, but\ncoming with Yashvin.",
      "And all at once a strange idea came to her: what\nif he had ceased to love her?",
      "And going over the events of the last few days, it seemed to her that\nshe saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea.",
      "The fact\nthat he had not dined at home yesterday, and the fact that he had\ninsisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg, and that\neven now he was not coming to her alone, as though he were trying to\navoid meeting her face to face.",
      "But he ought to tell me so.",
      "I must know that it is so.",
      "If I knew it,\nthen I know what I should do,  she said to herself, utterly unable to\npicture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced\nof his not caring for her.",
      "She thought he had ceased to love her, she\nfelt close upon despair, and consequently she felt exceptionally alert.",
      "She rang for her maid and went to her dressing-room.",
      "As she dressed,\nshe took more care over her appearance than she had done all those\ndays, as though he might, if he had grown cold to her, fall in love\nwith her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way\nmost becoming to her.",
      "She heard the bell ring before she was ready.",
      "When she went into the\ndrawing-room it was not he, but Yashvin, who met her eyes.",
      "Vronsky was\nlooking through the photographs of her son, which she had forgotten on\nthe table, and he made no haste to look round at her.",
      "We have met already,  she said, putting her little hand into the huge\nhand of Yashvin, whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with\nhis immense frame and coarse face.",
      "We met last year at the races.",
      "Give\nthem to me,  she said, with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the\nphotographs of her son, and glancing significantly at him with flashing\neyes.",
      "Were the races good this year?",
      "Instead of them I saw the races\nin the Corso in Rome.",
      "But you don t care for life abroad,  she said\nwith a cordial smile.",
      "I know you and all your tastes, though I have\nseen so little of you.",
      "I m awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly bad,  said\nYashvin, gnawing at his left mustache.",
      "Having talked a little while, and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the\nclock, Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in\nPetersburg, and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap.",
      "Not long, I think,  she said hesitatingly, glancing at Vronsky.",
      "So then we shan t meet again?",
      "Come and dine with me,  said Anna resolutely, angry it seemed with\nherself for her embarrassment, but flushing as she always did when she\ndefined her position before a fresh person.",
      "The dinner here is not\ngood, but at least you will see him.",
      "There is no one of his old friends\nin the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for you.",
      "Delighted,  said Yashvin with a smile, from which Vronsky could see\nthat he liked Anna very much.",
      "Yashvin said good-bye and went away; Vronsky stayed behind.",
      "Are you going too?",
      "she said to him.",
      "I m late already,  he answered.",
      "Run along!",
      "I ll catch you up in a\nmoment,  he called to Yashvin.",
      "She took him by the hand, and without taking her eyes off him, gazed at\nhim while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep\nhim.",
      "Wait a minute, there s something I want to say to you,  and taking his\nbroad hand she pressed it on her neck.",
      "Oh, was it right my asking him\nto dinner?",
      "You did quite right,  he said with a serene smile that showed his even\nteeth, and he kissed her hand.",
      "Alexey, you have not changed to me?",
      "she said, pressing his hand in\nboth of hers.",
      "Alexey, I am miserable here.",
      "When are we going away?",
      "Soon, soon.",
      "You wouldn t believe how disagreeable our way of living\nhere is to me too,  he said, and he drew away his hand.",
      "Well, go, go!",
      "she said in a tone of offense, and she walked quickly\naway from him.",
      "Chapter 32\n\nWhen Vronsky returned home, Anna was not yet home.",
      "Soon after he had\nleft, some lady, so they told him, had come to see her, and she had\ngone out with her.",
      "That she had gone out without leaving word where she\nwas going, that she had not yet come back, and that all the morning she\nhad been going about somewhere without a word to him all this, together\nwith the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning, and the\nrecollection of the hostile tone with which she had before Yashvin\nalmost snatched her son s photographs out of his hands, made him\nserious.",
      "He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her.",
      "And he\nwaited for her in her drawing-room.",
      "But Anna did not return alone, but\nbrought with her her old unmarried aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.",
      "This was\nthe lady who had come in the morning, and with whom Anna had gone out\nshopping.",
      "Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky s worried and inquiring\nexpression, and began a lively account of her morning s shopping.",
      "He\nsaw that there was something working within her; in her flashing eyes,\nwhen they rested for a moment on him, there was an intense\nconcentration, and in her words and movements there was that nervous\nrapidity and grace which, during the early period of their intimacy,\nhad so fascinated him, but which now so disturbed and alarmed him.",
      "The dinner was laid for four.",
      "All were gathered together and about to\ngo into the little dining-room when Tushkevitch made his appearance\nwith a message from Princess Betsy.",
      "Princess Betsy begged her to excuse\nher not having come to say good-bye; she had been indisposed, but\nbegged Anna to come to her between half-past six and nine o clock.",
      "Vronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time, so suggestive of\nsteps having been taken that she should meet no one; but Anna appeared\nnot to notice it.",
      "Very sorry that I can t come just between half-past six and nine,  she\nsaid with a faint smile.",
      "The princess will be very sorry.",
      "And so am I.",
      "You re going, no doubt, to hear Patti?",
      "said Tushkevitch.",
      "Patti?",
      "You suggest the idea to me.",
      "I would go if it were possible to\nget a box.",
      "I can get one,  Tushkevitch offered his services.",
      "I should be very, very grateful to you,  said Anna.",
      "But won t you\ndine with us?",
      "Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug.",
      "He was at a complete loss to\nunderstand what Anna was about.",
      "What had she brought the old Princess\nOblonskaya home for, what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for,\nand, most amazing of all, why was she sending him for a box?",
      "Could she\npossibly think in her position of going to Patti s benefit, where all\nthe circle of her acquaintances would be?",
      "He looked at her with serious\neyes, but she responded with that defiant, half-mirthful,\nhalf-desperate look, the meaning of which he could not comprehend.",
      "At\ndinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits she almost flirted both\nwith Tushkevitch and with Yashvin.",
      "When they got up from dinner and\nTushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera, Yashvin went to smoke,\nand Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms.",
      "After sitting there\nfor some time he ran upstairs.",
      "Anna was already dressed in a low-necked\ngown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, and with\ncostly white lace on her head, framing her face, and particularly\nbecoming, showing up her dazzling beauty.",
      "Are you really going to the theater?",
      "he said, trying not to look at\nher.",
      "Why do you ask with such alarm?",
      "she said, wounded again at his not\nlooking at her.",
      "Why shouldn t I go?",
      "She appeared not to understand the motive of his words.",
      "Oh, of course, there s no reason whatever,  he said, frowning.",
      "That s just what I say,  she said, willfully refusing to see the irony\nof his tone, and quietly turning back her long, perfumed glove.",
      "Anna, for God s sake!",
      "what is the matter with you?",
      "he said, appealing\nto her exactly as once her husband had done.",
      "I don t understand what you are asking.",
      "You know that it s out of the question to go.",
      "Why so?",
      "I m not going alone.",
      "Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she\nis going with me.",
      "He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair.",
      "But do you mean to say you don t know?...",
      "he began.",
      "But I don t care to know!",
      "she almost shrieked.",
      "I don t care to.",
      "Do I\nregret what I have done?",
      "No, no, no!",
      "If it were all to do again from\nthe beginning, it would be the same.",
      "For us, for you and for me, there\nis only one thing that matters, whether we love each other.",
      "Other\npeople we need not consider.",
      "Why are we living here apart and not\nseeing each other?",
      "Why can t I go?",
      "I love you, and I don t care for\nanything,  she said in Russian, glancing at him with a peculiar gleam\nin her eyes that he could not understand.",
      "If you have not changed to\nme, why don t you look at me?",
      "He looked at her.",
      "He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress,\nalways so becoming to her.",
      "But now her beauty and elegance were just\nwhat irritated him.",
      "My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat you,  he\nsaid again in French, with a note of tender supplication in his voice,\nbut with coldness in his eyes.",
      "She did not hear his words, but she saw the coldness of his eyes, and\nanswered with irritation:\n\n And I beg you to explain why I should not go.",
      "Because it might cause you....  he hesitated.",
      "I don t understand.",
      "Yashvin _n est pas compromettant_, and Princess\nVarvara is no worse than others.",
      "Oh, here she is!",
      "Chapter 33\n\nVronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna,\nalmost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own\nposition.",
      "This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her\nplainly the cause of his anger.",
      "If he had told her directly what he was\nthinking, he would have said:\n\n In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to\nshow yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging\nyour position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to\nsociety, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.",
      "He could not say that to her.",
      "But how can she fail to see it, and what\nis going on in her?",
      "he said to himself.",
      "He felt at the same time that\nhis respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was\nintensified.",
      "He went back scowling to his rooms, and sitting down beside Yashvin,\nwho, with his long legs stretched out on a chair, was drinking brandy\nand seltzer water, he ordered a glass of the same for himself.",
      "You were talking of Lankovsky s Powerful.",
      "That s a fine horse, and I\nwould advise you to buy him,  said Yashvin, glancing at his comrade s\ngloomy face.",
      "His hind-quarters aren t quite first-rate, but the legs\nand head one couldn t wish for anything better.",
      "I think I will take him,  answered Vronsky.",
      "Their conversation about horses interested him, but he did not for an\ninstant forget Anna, and could not help listening to the sound of steps\nin the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece.",
      "Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the\ntheater.",
      "Yashvin, tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water, drank\nit and got up, buttoning his coat.",
      "Well, let s go,  he said, faintly smiling under his mustache, and\nshowing by this smile that he knew the cause of Vronsky s gloominess,\nand did not attach any significance to it.",
      "I m not going,  Vronsky answered gloomily.",
      "Well, I must, I promised to.",
      "Good-bye, then.",
      "If you do, come to the\nstalls; you can take Kruzin s stall,  added Yashvin as he went out.",
      "No, I m busy.",
      "A wife is a care, but it s worse when she s not a wife,  thought\nYashvin, as he walked out of the hotel.",
      "Vronsky, left alone, got up from his chair and began pacing up and down\nthe room.",
      "And what s today?",
      "The fourth night.... Yegor and his wife are there,\nand my mother, most likely.",
      "Of course all Petersburg s there.",
      "Now she s\ngone in, taken off her cloak and come into the light.",
      "Tushkevitch,\nYashvin, Princess Varvara,  he pictured them to himself....  What about\nme?",
      "Either that I m frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the\nright to protect her?",
      "From every point of view stupid, stupid!...",
      "And\nwhy is she putting me in such a position?",
      "he said with a gesture of\ndespair.",
      "With that gesture he knocked against the table, on which there was\nstanding the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy, and almost upset\nit.",
      "He tried to catch it, let it slip, and angrily kicked the table\nover and rang.",
      "If you care to be in my service,  he said to the valet who came in,\n you had better remember your duties.",
      "This shouldn t be here.",
      "You ought\nto have cleared away.",
      "The valet, conscious of his own innocence, would have defended himself,\nbut glancing at his master, he saw from his face that the only thing to\ndo was to be silent, and hurriedly threading his way in and out,\ndropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken\nglasses and bottles.",
      "That s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress\ncoat out.",
      "Vronsky went into the theater at half-past eight.",
      "The performance was\nin full swing.",
      "The little old box-keeper, recognizing Vronsky as he\nhelped him off with his fur coat, called him  Your Excellency,  and\nsuggested he should not take a number but should simply call Fyodor.",
      "In\nthe brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the box-opener and\ntwo attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors.",
      "Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet _staccato_\naccompaniment of the orchestra, and a single female voice rendering\ndistinctly a musical phrase.",
      "The door opened to let the box-opener slip\nthrough, and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky s hearing\nclearly.",
      "But the doors were closed again at once, and Vronsky did not\nhear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment, though\nhe knew from the thunder of applause that it was over.",
      "When he entered\nthe hall, brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets, the noise\nwas still going on.",
      "On the stage the singer, bowing and smiling, with\nbare shoulders flashing with diamonds, was, with the help of the tenor\nwho had given her his arm, gathering up the bouquets that were flying\nawkwardly over the footlights.",
      "Then she went up to a gentleman with\nglossy pomaded hair parted down the center, who was stretching across\nthe footlights holding out something to her, and all the public in the\nstalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement, craning forward,\nshouting and clapping.",
      "The conductor in his high chair assisted in\npassing the offering, and straightened his white tie.",
      "Vronsky walked\ninto the middle of the stalls, and, standing still, began looking about\nhim.",
      "That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the\nfamiliar, habitual surroundings, the stage, the noise, all the\nfamiliar, uninteresting, particolored herd of spectators in the packed\ntheater.",
      "There were, as always, the same ladies of some sort with officers of\nsome sort in the back of the boxes; the same gaily dressed women God\nknows who and uniforms and black coats; the same dirty crowd in the\nupper gallery; and among the crowd, in the boxes and in the front rows,\nwere some forty of the _real_ people.",
      "And to those oases Vronsky at\nonce directed his attention, and with them he entered at once into\nrelation.",
      "The act was over when he went in, and so he did not go straight to his\nbrother s box, but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the\nfootlights with Serpuhovskoy, who, standing with one knee raised and\nhis heel on the footlights, caught sight of him in the distance and\nbeckoned to him, smiling.",
      "Vronsky had not yet seen Anna.",
      "He purposely avoided looking in her\ndirection.",
      "But he knew by the direction of people s eyes where she was.",
      "He looked round discreetly, but he was not seeking her; expecting the\nworst, his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "To his relief Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening.",
      "How little of the military man there is left in you!",
      "Serpuhovskoy was\nsaying to him.",
      "A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one\nwould say.",
      "Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,  answered\nVronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his opera-glass.",
      "Well, I ll own I envy you there.",
      "When I come back from abroad and put\non this,  he touched his epaulets,  I regret my freedom.",
      "Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky s career, but he\nliked him as before, and was now particularly cordial to him.",
      "What a pity you were not in time for the first act!",
      "Vronsky, listening with one ear, moved his opera-glass from the stalls\nand scanned the boxes.",
      "Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man, who\nseemed to wave angrily in the moving opera-glass, Vronsky suddenly\ncaught sight of Anna s head, proud, strikingly beautiful, and smiling\nin the frame of lace.",
      "She was in the fifth box, twenty paces from him.",
      "She was sitting in front, and slightly turning, was saying something to\nYashvin.",
      "The setting of her head on her handsome, broad shoulders, and\nthe restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face\nreminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow.",
      "But\nhe felt utterly different towards her beauty now.",
      "In his feeling for\nher now there was no element of mystery, and so her beauty, though it\nattracted him even more intensely than before, gave him now a sense of\ninjury.",
      "She was not looking in his direction, but Vronsky felt that she\nhad seen him already.",
      "When Vronsky turned the opera-glass again in that direction, he noticed\nthat Princess Varvara was particularly red, and kept laughing\nunnaturally and looking round at the next box.",
      "Anna, folding her fan\nand tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and\nobviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box.",
      "Yashvin s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing\nat cards.",
      "Scowling, he sucked the left end of his mustache further and\nfurther into his mouth, and cast sidelong glances at the next box.",
      "In that box on the left were the Kartasovs.",
      "Vronsky knew them, and knew\nthat Anna was acquainted with them.",
      "Madame Kartasova, a thin little\nwoman, was standing up in her box, and, her back turned upon Anna, she\nwas putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her.",
      "Her face\nwas pale and angry, and she was talking excitedly.",
      "Kartasov, a fat,\nbald man, was continually looking round at Anna, while he attempted to\nsoothe his wife.",
      "When the wife had gone out, the husband lingered a\nlong while, and tried to catch Anna s eye, obviously anxious to bow to\nher.",
      "But Anna, with unmistakable intention, avoided noticing him, and\ntalked to Yashvin, whose cropped head was bent down to her.",
      "Kartasov\nwent out without making his salutation, and the box was left empty.",
      "Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the\nKartasovs and Anna, but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had\nhappened.",
      "He knew this both from what he had seen, and most of all from\nthe face of Anna, who, he could see, was taxing every nerve to carry\nthrough the part she had taken up.",
      "And in maintaining this attitude of\nexternal composure she was completely successful.",
      "Anyone who did not\nknow her and her circle, who had not heard all the utterances of the\nwomen expressive of commiseration, indignation, and amazement, that she\nshould show herself in society, and show herself so conspicuously with\nher lace and her beauty, would have admired the serenity and loveliness\nof this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the\nsensations of a man in the stocks.",
      "Knowing that something had happened, but not knowing precisely what,\nVronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety, and hoping to find out\nsomething, he went towards his brother s box.",
      "Purposely choosing the\nway round furthest from Anna s box, he jostled as he came out against\nthe colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances.",
      "Vronsky\nheard the name of Madame Karenina, and noticed how the colonel hastened\nto address Vronsky loudly by name, with a meaning glance at his\ncompanions.",
      "Ah, Vronsky!",
      "When are you coming to the regiment?",
      "We can t let you off\nwithout a supper.",
      "You re one of the old set,  said the colonel of his\nregiment.",
      "I can t stop, awfully sorry, another time,  said Vronsky, and he ran\nupstairs towards his brother s box.",
      "The old countess, Vronsky s mother, with her steel-gray curls, was in\nhis brother s box.",
      "Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in\nthe corridor.",
      "Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother, Varya held out her hand\nto her brother-in-law, and began immediately to speak of what\ninterested him.",
      "She was more excited than he had ever seen her.",
      "I think it s mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no right to do\nit.",
      "Madame Karenina....  she began.",
      "But what is it?",
      "I don t know.",
      "What?",
      "you ve not heard?",
      "You know I should be the last person to hear of it.",
      "There isn t a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!",
      "But what did she do?",
      "My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina.",
      "Her husband\nbegan talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.",
      "She said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went away.",
      "Count, your maman is asking for you,  said the young Princess\nSorokina, peeping out of the door of the box.",
      "I ve been expecting you all the while,  said his mother, smiling\nsarcastically.",
      "You were nowhere to be seen.",
      "Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight.",
      "Good evening, maman.",
      "I have come to you,  he said coldly.",
      "Why aren t you going to _faire la cour   Madame Karenina?_  she went\non, when Princess Sorokina had moved away.",
      "_Elle fait sensation.",
      "On\noublie la Patti pour elle_.",
      "Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,  he\nanswered, scowling.",
      "I m only saying what everyone s saying.",
      "Vronsky made no reply, and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina, he\nwent away.",
      "At the door he met his brother.",
      "Ah, Alexey!",
      "said his brother.",
      "How disgusting!",
      "Idiot of a woman,\nnothing else....",
      "I wanted to go straight to her.",
      "Let s go together.",
      "Vronsky did not hear him.",
      "With rapid steps he went downstairs; he felt\nthat he must do something, but he did not know what.",
      "Anger with her for\nhaving put herself and him in such a false position, together with pity\nfor her suffering, filled his heart.",
      "He went down, and made straight\nfor Anna s box.",
      "At her box stood Stremov, talking to her.",
      "There are no more tenors.",
      "_Le moule en est bris !_ \n\nVronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov.",
      "You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,  Anna said\nto Vronsky, glancing ironically, he thought, at him.",
      "I am a poor judge of music,  he said, looking sternly at her.",
      "Like Prince Yashvin,  she said smiling,  who considers that Patti\nsings too loud.",
      "Thank you,  she said, her little hand in its long glove taking the\nplaybill Vronsky picked up, and suddenly at that instant her lovely\nface quivered.",
      "She got up and went into the interior of the box.",
      "Noticing in the next act that her box was empty, Vronsky, rousing\nindignant  hushes  in the silent audience, went out in the middle of a\nsolo and drove home.",
      "Anna was already at home.",
      "When Vronsky went up to her, she was in the\nsame dress as she had worn at the theater.",
      "She was sitting in the first\narmchair against the wall, looking straight before her.",
      "She looked at\nhim, and at once resumed her former position.",
      "Anna,  he said.",
      "You, you are to blame for everything!",
      "she cried, with tears of\ndespair and hatred in her voice, getting up.",
      "I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be unpleasant....",
      "Unpleasant!",
      "she cried hideous!",
      "As long as I live I shall never\nforget it.",
      "She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.",
      "A silly woman s chatter,  he said:  but why risk it, why provoke?...",
      "I hate your calm.",
      "You ought not to have brought me to this.",
      "If you had\nloved me.... \n\n Anna!",
      "How does the question of my love come in?",
      "Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am!...",
      "she\nsaid, looking at him with an expression of terror.",
      "He was sorry for her, and angry notwithstanding.",
      "He assured her of his\nlove because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her, and\nhe did not reproach her in words, but in his heart he reproached her.",
      "And the asseverations of his love, which seemed to him so vulgar that\nhe was ashamed to utter them, she drank in eagerly, and gradually\nbecame calmer.",
      "The next day, completely reconciled, they left for the\ncountry.",
      "PART SIX\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nDarya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe, at\nher sister Kitty Levin s. The house on her own estate was quite in\nruins, and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer\nwith them.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement.",
      "He\nsaid he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending\nthe summer in the country with his family, which would have been the\ngreatest happiness for him; and remaining in Moscow, he came down to\nthe country from time to time for a day or two.",
      "Besides the Oblonskys,\nwith all their children and their governess, the old princess too came\nto stay that summer with the Levins, as she considered it her duty to\nwatch over her inexperienced daughter in her _interesting condition_.",
      "Moreover, Varenka, Kitty s friend abroad, kept her promise to come to\nKitty when she was married, and stayed with her friend.",
      "All of these\nwere friends or relations of Levin s wife.",
      "And though he liked them\nall, he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways, which was\nsmothered by this influx of the  Shtcherbatsky element,  as he called\nit to himself.",
      "Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey\nIvanovitch, but he too was a man of the Koznishev and not the Levin\nstamp, so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated.",
      "In the Levins  house, so long deserted, there were now so many people\nthat almost all the rooms were occupied, and almost every day it\nhappened that the old princess, sitting down to table, counted them all\nover, and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate\ntable.",
      "And Kitty, with her careful housekeeping, had no little trouble\nto get all the chickens, turkeys, and geese, of which so many were\nneeded to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children.",
      "The whole family were sitting at dinner.",
      "Dolly s children, with their\ngoverness and Varenka, were making plans for going to look for\nmushrooms.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, who was looked up to by all the party for\nhis intellect and learning, with a respect that almost amounted to awe,\nsurprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.",
      "Take me with you.",
      "I am very fond of picking mushrooms,  he said,\nlooking at Varenka;  I think it s a very nice occupation.",
      "Oh, we shall be delighted,  answered Varenka, coloring a little.",
      "Kitty\nexchanged meaningful glances with Dolly.",
      "The proposal of the learned\nand intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with\nVarenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty s with which her mind had\nbeen very busy of late.",
      "She made haste to address some remark to her\nmother, so that her look should not be noticed.",
      "After dinner Sergey\nIvanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing-room window, and\nwhile he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother, he\nwatched the door through which the children would start on the\nmushroom-picking expedition.",
      "Levin was sitting in the window near his\nbrother.",
      "Kitty stood beside her husband, evidently awaiting the end of a\nconversation that had no interest for her, in order to tell him\nsomething.",
      "You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the\nbetter,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, smiling to Kitty, and obviously little\ninterested in the conversation,  but you have remained true to your\npassion for defending the most paradoxical theories.",
      "Katya, it s not good for you to stand,  her husband said to her,\nputting a chair for her and looking significantly at her.",
      "Oh, and there s no time either,  added Sergey Ivanovitch, seeing the\nchildren running out.",
      "At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways, in her tightly-drawn\nstockings, and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch s hat, she ran\nstraight up to him.",
      "Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes, so like her\nfather s fine eyes, she handed him his hat and made as though she would\nput it on for him, softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile.",
      "Varenka s waiting,  she said, carefully putting his hat on, seeing\nfrom Sergey Ivanovitch s smile that she might do so.",
      "Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with\na white kerchief on her head.",
      "I m coming, I m coming, Varvara Andreevna,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,\nfinishing his cup of coffee, and putting into their separate pockets\nhis handkerchief and cigar-case.",
      "And how sweet my Varenka is!",
      "eh?",
      "said Kitty to her husband, as soon\nas Sergey Ivanovitch rose.",
      "She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could\nhear, and it was clear that she meant him to do so.",
      "And how\ngood-looking she is such a refined beauty!",
      "Varenka!",
      "Kitty shouted.",
      "Shall you be in the mill copse?",
      "We ll come out to you.",
      "You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,  said the old princess,\nhurriedly coming out at the door.",
      "You mustn t shout like that.",
      "Varenka, hearing Kitty s voice and her mother s reprimand, went with\nlight, rapid steps up to Kitty.",
      "The rapidity of her movement, her\nflushed and eager face, everything betrayed that something out of the\ncommon was going on in her.",
      "Kitty knew what this was, and had been\nwatching her intently.",
      "She called Varenka at that moment merely in\norder mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which, as\nKitty fancied, was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the\nwood.",
      "Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to\nhappen,  she whispered as she kissed her.",
      "And are you coming with us?",
      "Varenka said to Levin in confusion,\npretending not to have heard what had been said.",
      "I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall\nstop.",
      "Why, what do you want there?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice, \nsaid Levin;  and where will you be?",
      "On the terrace.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nOn the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party.",
      "They always\nliked sitting there after dinner, and that day they had work to do\nthere too.",
      "Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes, with which\nall of them were busy, that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace\nby a method new to Agafea Mihalovna, without the addition of water.",
      "Kitty had introduced this new method, which had been in use in her\nhome.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, to whom the task of jam-making had always been\nintrusted, considering that what had been done in the Levin household\ncould not be amiss, had nevertheless put water with the strawberries,\nmaintaining that the jam could not be made without it.",
      "She had been\ncaught in the act, and was now making jam before everyone, and it was\nto be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made\nwithout water.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna, her face heated and angry, her hair untidy, and her\nthin arms bare to the elbows, was turning the preserving-pan over the\ncharcoal stove, looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping\nthey would stick and not cook properly.",
      "The princess, conscious that\nAgafea Mihalovna s wrath must be chiefly directed against her, as the\nperson responsible for the raspberry jam-making, tried to appear to be\nabsorbed in other things and not interested in the jam, talked of other\nmatters, but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove.",
      "I always buy my maids  dresses myself, of some cheap material,  the\nprincess said, continuing the previous conversation.",
      "Isn t it time to\nskim it, my dear?",
      "she added, addressing Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "There s not\nthe slightest need for you to do it, and it s hot for you,  she said,\nstopping Kitty.",
      "I ll do it,  said Dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the\nspoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the\nclinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered\nwith yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup.",
      "How they ll enjoy this\nat tea-time!",
      "she thought of her children, remembering how she herself\nas a child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what\nwas best of all the scum of the jam.",
      "Stiva says it s much better to give money.",
      "Dolly took up meanwhile\nthe weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to\nservants.",
      "But.... \n\n Money s out of the question!",
      "the princess and Kitty exclaimed with\none voice.",
      "They appreciate a present.... \n\n Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a\npoplin, but something of that sort,  said the princess.",
      "I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.",
      "A charming pattern so simple and refined, I should have liked it\nmyself, if she hadn t had it.",
      "Something like Varenka s. So pretty and\ninexpensive.",
      "Well, now I think it s done,  said Dolly, dropping the syrup from the\nspoon.",
      "When it sets as it drops, it s ready.",
      "Cook it a little longer, Agafea\nMihalovna.",
      "The flies!",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna angrily.",
      "It ll be just the same, \nshe added.",
      "Ah!",
      "how sweet it is!",
      "don t frighten it!",
      "Kitty said suddenly, looking\nat a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center\nof a raspberry.",
      "Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,  said her mother.",
      "_  propos de Varenka_,  said Kitty, speaking in French, as they had\nbeen doing all the while, so that Agafea Mihalovna should not\nunderstand them,  you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be\nsettled today.",
      "You know what I mean.",
      "How splendid it would be!",
      "But what a famous matchmaker she is!",
      "said Dolly.",
      "How carefully and\ncleverly she throws them together!...",
      "No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?",
      "Why, what is one to think?",
      "He  (_he_ meant Sergey Ivanovitch)  might\nat any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course,\nhe s not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be\nglad to marry him even now.... She s a very nice girl, but he\nmight.... \n\n Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing\nbetter could be imagined.",
      "In the first place, she s charming!",
      "said\nKitty, crooking one of her fingers.",
      "He thinks her very attractive, that s certain,  assented Dolly.",
      "Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to\nlook for either fortune or position in his wife.",
      "All he needs is a\ngood, sweet wife a restful one.",
      "Well, with her he would certainly be restful,  Dolly assented.",
      "Thirdly, that she should love him.",
      "And so it is ... that is, it would\nbe so splendid!...",
      "I look forward to seeing them coming out of the\nforest and everything settled.",
      "I shall see at once by their eyes.",
      "I\nshould be so delighted!",
      "What do you think, Dolly?",
      "But don t excite yourself.",
      "It s not at all the thing for you to be\nexcited,  said her mother.",
      "Oh, I m not excited, mamma.",
      "I fancy he will make her an offer today.",
      "Ah, that s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!...",
      "There is\na sort of barrier, and all at once it s broken down,  said Dolly,\nsmiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?",
      "Kitty asked suddenly.",
      "There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,  answered the\nprincess, but her face beamed all over at the recollection.",
      "Oh, but how was it?",
      "You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to\nspeak?",
      "Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother\non equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a\nwoman s life.",
      "Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.",
      "But how was it settled between you, mamma?",
      "You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new?",
      "It s\nalways just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles.... \n\n How nicely you said that, mamma!",
      "It s just by the eyes, by smiles that\nit s done,  Dolly assented.",
      "But what words did he say?",
      "What did Kostya say to you?",
      "He wrote it in chalk.",
      "It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!",
      "she\nsaid.",
      "And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing.",
      "Kitty was the\nfirst to break the silence.",
      "She remembered all that last winter before\nher marriage, and her passion for Vronsky.",
      "There s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka s,  she said, a\nnatural chain of ideas bringing her to this point.",
      "I should have liked\nto say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him.",
      "They re all all\nmen, I mean,  she added,  awfully jealous over our past.",
      "Not all,  said Dolly.",
      "You judge by your own husband.",
      "It makes him\nmiserable even now to remember Vronsky.",
      "Eh?",
      "that s true, isn t it?",
      "Yes,  Kitty answered, a pensive smile in her eyes.",
      "But I really don t know,  the mother put in in defense of her motherly\ncare of her daughter,  what there was in your past that could worry\nhim?",
      "That Vronsky paid you attentions that happens to every girl.",
      "Oh, yes, but we didn t mean that,  Kitty said, flushing a little.",
      "No, let me speak,  her mother went on,  why, you yourself would not\nlet me have a talk to Vronsky.",
      "Don t you remember?",
      "Oh, mamma!",
      "said Kitty, with an expression of suffering.",
      "There s no keeping you young people in check nowadays....",
      "Your\nfriendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable.",
      "I should\nmyself have called upon him to explain himself.",
      "But, my darling, it s\nnot right for you to be agitated.",
      "Please remember that, and calm\nyourself.",
      "I m perfectly calm, maman.",
      "How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,  said Dolly,  and how\nunhappy for her.",
      "It turned out quite the opposite,  she said, struck by\nher own ideas.",
      "Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself\nunhappy.",
      "Now it is just the opposite.",
      "I often think of her.",
      "A nice person to think about!",
      "Horrid, repulsive woman no heart,  said\nher mother, who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky,\nbut Levin.",
      "What do you want to talk of it for?",
      "Kitty said with annoyance.",
      "I\nnever think about it, and I don t want to think of it.... And I don t\nwant to think of it,  she said, catching the sound of her husband s\nwell-known step on the steps of the terrace.",
      "What s that you don t want to think about?",
      "inquired Levin, coming\nonto the terrace.",
      "But no one answered him, and he did not repeat the question.",
      "I m sorry I ve broken in on your feminine parliament,  he said,\nlooking round on everyone discontentedly, and perceiving that they had\nbeen talking of something which they would not talk about before him.",
      "For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea\nMihalovna, vexation at their making jam without water, and altogether\nat the outside Shtcherbatsky element.",
      "He smiled, however, and went up\nto Kitty.",
      "Well, how are you?",
      "he asked her, looking at her with the expression\nwith which everyone looked at her now.",
      "Oh, very well,  said Kitty, smiling,  and how have things gone with\nyou?",
      "The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did.",
      "Well, are we\ngoing for the children?",
      "I ve ordered the horses to be put in.",
      "What!",
      "you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?",
      "her mother said\nreproachfully.",
      "Yes, at a walking pace, princess.",
      "Levin never called the princess  maman  as men often do call their\nmothers-in-law, and the princess disliked his not doing so.",
      "But though\nhe liked and respected the princess, Levin could not call her so\nwithout a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother.",
      "Come with us, maman,  said Kitty.",
      "I don t like to see such imprudence.",
      "Well, I ll walk then, I m so well.",
      "Kitty got up and went to her\nhusband and took his hand.",
      "You may be well, but everything in moderation,  said the princess.",
      "Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?",
      "said Levin, smiling to\nAgafea Mihalovna, and trying to cheer her up.",
      "Is it all right in the\nnew way?",
      "I suppose it s all right.",
      "For our notions it s boiled too long.",
      "It ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won t mildew, even\nthough our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we ve no cool cellar\nto store it,  said Kitty, at once divining her husband s motive, and\naddressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling;  but your\npickle s so good, that mamma says she never tasted any like it,  she\nadded, smiling, and putting her kerchief straight.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna looked angrily at Kitty.",
      "You needn t try to console me, mistress.",
      "I need only to look at you\nwith him, and I feel happy,  she said, and something in the rough\nfamiliarity of that _with him_ touched Kitty.",
      "Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best\nplaces.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna smiled and shook her head, as though to say:\n I should like to be angry with you too, but I can t. \n\n Do it, please, by my receipt,  said the princess;  put some paper over\nthe jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it\nwill never go mildewy.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nKitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her\nhusband, for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed\nover his face always so quick to reflect every feeling at the moment\nwhen he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of,\nand had got no answer.",
      "When they had set off on foot ahead of the others, and had come out of\nsight of the house onto the beaten dusty road, marked with rusty wheels\nand sprinkled with grains of corn, she clung faster to his arm and\npressed it closer to her.",
      "He had quite forgotten the momentary\nunpleasant impression, and alone with her he felt, now that the thought\nof her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his\nmind, a new and delicious bliss, quite pure from all alloy of sense, in\nthe being near to the woman he loved.",
      "There was no need of speech, yet\nhe longed to hear the sound of her voice, which like her eyes had\nchanged since she had been with child.",
      "In her voice, as in her eyes,\nthere was that softness and gravity which is found in people\ncontinually concentrated on some cherished pursuit.",
      "So you re not tired?",
      "Lean more on me,  said he.",
      "No, I m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own,\nthough I m happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.",
      "That was good, but this is even better.",
      "Both are better,  he said,\nsqueezing her hand.",
      "Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?",
      "About jam?",
      "Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers.",
      "Ah!",
      "said Levin, listening more to the sound of her voice than to the\nwords she was saying, and all the while paying attention to the road,\nwhich passed now through the forest, and avoiding places where she\nmight make a false step.",
      "And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka.",
      "You ve noticed?...",
      "I m very\nanxious for it,  she went on.",
      "What do you think about it?",
      "And she\npeeped into his face.",
      "I don t know what to think,  Levin answered, smiling.",
      "Sergey seems\nvery strange to me in that way.",
      "I told you, you know....",
      "Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died.... \n\n That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and\ntradition.",
      "I remember him then.",
      "He was wonderfully sweet.",
      "But I ve\nwatched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes,\nbut one feels that to him they re simply people, not women.",
      "Yes, but now with Varenka ...",
      "I fancy there s something.... \n\n Perhaps there is....",
      "But one has to know him....",
      "He s a peculiar,\nwonderful person.",
      "He lives a spiritual life only.",
      "He s too pure, too\nexalted a nature.",
      "Why?",
      "Would this lower him, then?",
      "No, but he s so used to a spiritual life that he can t reconcile\nhimself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.",
      "Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly, without\ntaking the trouble of clothing it in exact language.",
      "He knew that his\nwife, in such moments of loving tenderness as now, would understand\nwhat he meant to say from a hint, and she did understand him.",
      "Yes, but there s not so much of that actual fact about her as about\nme.",
      "I can see that he would never have cared for me.",
      "She is altogether\nspiritual.",
      "Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people\nlike you....",
      "Yes, he s very nice to me; but....",
      "It s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each\nother,  Levin finished.",
      "Why not speak of him?",
      "he added.",
      "I sometimes\nblame myself for not; it ends in one s forgetting.",
      "Ah, how terrible and\ndear he was!...",
      "Yes, what were we talking about?",
      "Levin said, after a\npause.",
      "You think he can t fall in love,  said Kitty, translating into her own\nlanguage.",
      "It s not so much that he can t fall in love,  Levin said, smiling,\n but he has not the weakness necessary....",
      "I ve always envied him, and\neven now, when I m so happy, I still envy him.",
      "You envy him for not being able to fall in love?",
      "I envy him for being better than I,  said Levin.",
      "He does not live for\nhimself.",
      "His whole life is subordinated to his duty.",
      "And that s why he\ncan be calm and contented.",
      "And you?",
      "Kitty asked, with an ironical and loving smile.",
      "She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her\nsmile; but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his\nbrother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.",
      "Kitty knew that\nthis insincerity came from his love for his brother, from his sense of\nshame at being too happy, and above all from his unflagging craving to\nbe better she loved it in him, and so she smiled.",
      "And you?",
      "What are you dissatisfied with?",
      "she asked, with the same\nsmile.",
      "Her disbelief in his self-dissatisfaction delighted him, and\nunconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds\nof her disbelief.",
      "I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself....  he said.",
      "Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?",
      "Well, how shall I say?...",
      "In my heart I really care for nothing\nwhatever but that you should not stumble see?",
      "Oh, but really you\nmustn t skip about like that!",
      "he cried, breaking off to scold her for\ntoo agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path.",
      "But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others,\nespecially with my brother, I feel I m a poor creature.",
      "But in what way?",
      "Kitty pursued with the same smile.",
      "Don t you too\nwork for others?",
      "What about your co-operative settlement, and your work\non the estate, and your book?...",
      "Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now it s your fault,  he said,\npressing her hand that all that doesn t count.",
      "I do it in a way\nhalfheartedly.",
      "If I could care for all that as I care for you!...",
      "Instead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.",
      "Well, what would you say about papa?",
      "asked Kitty.",
      "Is he a poor\ncreature then, as he does nothing for the public good?",
      "He?",
      "no!",
      "But then one must have the simplicity, the\nstraightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven t got\nthat.",
      "I do nothing, and I fret about it.",
      "It s all your doing.",
      "Before\nthere was you and _this_ too,  he added with a glance towards her waist\nthat she understood I put all my energies into work; now I can t, and\nI m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I m\npretending.... \n\n Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey\nIvanovitch?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "Would you like to do this work for the\ngeneral good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing\nelse?",
      "Of course not,  said Levin.",
      "But I m so happy that I don t understand\nanything.",
      "So you think he ll make her an offer today?",
      "he added after a\nbrief silence.",
      "I think so, and I don t think so.",
      "Only, I m awfully anxious for it.",
      "Here, wait a minute.",
      "She stooped down and picked a wild camomile at\nthe edge of the path.",
      "Come, count: he does propose, he doesn t,  she\nsaid, giving him the flower.",
      "He does, he doesn t,  said Levin, tearing off the white petals.",
      "No, no!",
      "Kitty, snatching at his hand, stopped him.",
      "She had been\nwatching his fingers with interest.",
      "You picked off two.",
      "Oh, but see, this little one shan t count to make up,  said Levin,\ntearing off a little half-grown petal.",
      "Here s the wagonette overtaking\nus.",
      "Aren t you tired, Kitty?",
      "called the princess.",
      "Not in the least.",
      "If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.",
      "But it was not worth while to get in, they were quite near the place,\nand all walked on together.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nVarenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the\nchildren, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same\ntime visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from\nthe man she cared for, was very attractive.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch walked\nbeside her, and never left off admiring her.",
      "Looking at her, he\nrecalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips, all the\ngood he knew about her, and became more and more conscious that the\nfeeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long,\nlong ago, and only once, in his early youth.",
      "The feeling of happiness\nin being near her continually grew, and at last reached such a point\nthat, as he put a huge, slender-stalked agaric fungus in her basket, he\nlooked straight into her face, and noticing the flush of glad and\nalarmed excitement that overspread her face, he was confused himself,\nand smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much.",
      "If so,  he said to himself,  I ought to think it over and make up my\nmind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.",
      "I m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my\nefforts will make no show,  he said, and he left the edge of the forest\nwhere they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees\nstanding far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where\nbetween the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark\nbushes of hazel.",
      "Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch,\nknowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in\nfull flower with its rosy red catkins.",
      "It was perfectly still all round\nhim.",
      "Only overhead in the birches under which he stood, the flies, like\na swarm of bees, buzzed unceasingly, and from time to time the\nchildren s voices were floated across to him.",
      "All at once he heard, not\nfar from the edge of the wood, the sound of Varenka s contralto voice,\ncalling Grisha, and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch s\nface.",
      "Conscious of this smile, he shook his head disapprovingly at his\nown condition, and taking out a cigar, he began lighting it.",
      "For a long\nwhile he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch\ntree.",
      "The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and\nthe light went out.",
      "At last one of the matches burned, and the fragrant\ncigar smoke, hovering uncertainly in flat, wide coils, stretched away\nforwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a\nbirch tree.",
      "Watching the streak of smoke, Sergey Ivanovitch walked\ngently on, deliberating on his position.",
      "Why not?",
      "he thought.",
      "If it were only a passing fancy or a passion,\nif it were only this attraction this mutual attraction (I can call it a\n_mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with\nthe whole bent of my life if I felt that in giving way to this\nattraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it s\nnot so.",
      "The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie,\nI said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory.",
      "That s the\nonly thing I can say against my feeling.... That s a great thing, \nSergey Ivanovitch said to himself, feeling at the same time that this\nconsideration had not the slightest importance for him personally, but\nwould only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of\nothers.",
      "But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never\nfind anything to say against my feeling.",
      "If I were choosing by\nconsiderations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything\nbetter.",
      "However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew, he could not\nthink of a girl who united to such a degree all, positively all, the\nqualities he would wish to see in his wife.",
      "She had all the charm and\nfreshness of youth, but she was not a child; and if she loved him, she\nloved him consciously as a woman ought to love; that was one thing.",
      "Another point: she was not only far from being worldly, but had an\nunmistakable distaste for worldly society, and at the same time she\nknew the world, and had all the ways of a woman of the best society,\nwhich were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch s conception of\nthe woman who was to share his life.",
      "Thirdly: she was religious, and\nnot like a child, unconsciously religious and good, as Kitty, for\nexample, was, but her life was founded on religious principles.",
      "Even in\ntrifling matters, Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in\nhis wife: she was poor and alone in the world, so she would not bring\nwith her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband s\nhouse, as he saw now in Kitty s case.",
      "She would owe everything to her\nhusband, which was what he had always desired too for his future family\nlife.",
      "And this girl, who united all these qualities, loved him.",
      "He was\na modest man, but he could not help seeing it.",
      "And he loved her.",
      "There\nwas one consideration against it his age.",
      "But he came of a long-lived\nfamily, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for\nforty, and he remembered Varenka s saying that it was only in Russia\nthat men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of\nfifty considers himself _dans la force de l ge_, while a man of forty\nis _un jeune homme_.",
      "But what did the mere reckoning of years matter\nwhen he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago?",
      "Was it\nnot youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to\nthe edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting\nsunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her\nbasket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when\nthis impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with\nthe beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the\nslanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked\nwith yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?",
      "His heart\nthrobbed joyously.",
      "A softened feeling came over him.",
      "He felt that he\nhad made up his mind.",
      "Varenka, who had just crouched down to pick a\nmushroom, rose with a supple movement and looked round.",
      "Flinging away\nthe cigar, Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her.",
      "Chapter 5\n\n Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the\nideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife.",
      "I have\nlived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I\nsought in you.",
      "I love you, and offer you my hand.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces\nfrom Varvara.",
      "Kneeling down, with her hands over the mushrooms to guard\nthem from Grisha, she was calling little Masha.",
      "Come here, little ones!",
      "There are so many!",
      "she was saying in her\nsweet, deep voice.",
      "Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching, she did not get up and did not\nchange her position, but everything told him that she felt his presence\nand was glad of it.",
      "Well, did you find some?",
      "she asked from under the white kerchief,\nturning her handsome, gently smiling face to him.",
      "Not one,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Did you?",
      "She did not answer, busy with the children who thronged about her.",
      "That one too, near the twig,  she pointed out to little Masha a little\nfungus, split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under\nwhich it thrust itself.",
      "Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus,\nbreaking it into two white halves.",
      "This brings back my childhood,  she\nadded, moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "They walked on for some steps in silence.",
      "Varenka saw that he wanted to\nspeak; she guessed of what, and felt faint with joy and panic.",
      "They had\nwalked so far away that no one could hear them now, but still he did\nnot begin to speak.",
      "It would have been better for Varenka to be silent.",
      "After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they\nwanted to say than after talking about mushrooms.",
      "But against her own\nwill, as it were accidentally, Varenka said:\n\n So you found nothing?",
      "In the middle of the wood there are always\nfewer, though.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer.",
      "He was\nannoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms.",
      "He wanted to bring her\nback to the first words she had uttered about her childhood; but after\na pause of some length, as though against his own will, he made an\nobservation in response to her last words.",
      "I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at\nthe edge of the wood, though I can t tell them apart.",
      "Some minutes more passed, they moved still further away from the\nchildren, and were quite alone.",
      "Varenka s heart throbbed so that she\nheard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red\nagain.",
      "To be the wife of a man like Koznishev, after her position with Madame\nStahl, was to her imagination the height of happiness.",
      "Besides, she was\nalmost certain that she was in love with him.",
      "And this moment it would\nhave to be decided.",
      "She felt frightened.",
      "She dreaded both his speaking\nand his not speaking.",
      "Now or never it must be said that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too.",
      "Everything in the expression, the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes\nof Varenka betrayed a painful suspense.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and\nfelt sorry for her.",
      "He felt even that to say nothing now would be a\nslight to her.",
      "Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in\nsupport of his decision.",
      "He even said over to himself the words in\nwhich he meant to put his offer, but instead of those words, some\nutterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask:\n\n What is the difference between the  birch  mushroom and the  white \nmushroom?",
      "Varenka s lips quivered with emotion as she answered:\n\n In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it s in the stalk.",
      "And as soon as these words were uttered, both he and she felt that it\nwas over, that what was to have been said would not be said; and their\nemotion, which had up to then been continually growing more intense,\nbegan to subside.",
      "The birch mushroom s stalk suggests a dark man s chin after two days\nwithout shaving,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, speaking quite calmly now.",
      "Yes, that s true,  answered Varenka smiling, and unconsciously the\ndirection of their walk changed.",
      "They began to turn towards the\nchildren.",
      "Varenka felt both sore and ashamed; at the same time she had\na sense of relief.",
      "When he had got home again and went over the whole subject, Sergey\nIvanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one.",
      "He\ncould not be false to the memory of Marie.",
      "Gently, children, gently!",
      "Levin shouted quite angrily to the\nchildren, standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of\nchildren flew with shrieks of delight to meet them.",
      "Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the\nwood.",
      "Kitty had no need to ask Varenka; she saw from the calm and\nsomewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off.",
      "Well?",
      "her husband questioned her as they were going home again.",
      "It doesn t bite,  said Kitty, her smile and manner of speaking\nrecalling her father, a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure.",
      "How doesn t bite?",
      "I ll show you,  she said, taking her husband s hand, lifting it to her\nmouth, and just faintly brushing it with closed lips.",
      "Like a kiss on a\npriest s hand.",
      "Which didn t it bite with?",
      "he said, laughing.",
      "Both.",
      "But it should have been like this....",
      "There are some peasants coming.... \n\n Oh, they didn t see.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nDuring the time of the children s tea the grown-up people sat in the\nbalcony and talked as though nothing had happened, though they all,\nespecially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka, were very well aware that\nthere had happened an event which, though negative, was of very great\nimportance.",
      "They both had the same feeling, rather like that of a\nschoolboy after an examination, which has left him in the same class or\nshut him out of the school forever.",
      "Everyone present, feeling too that\nsomething had happened, talked eagerly about extraneous subjects.",
      "Levin\nand Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that\nevening.",
      "And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a\ndisagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and\ncould not and they felt a prick of conscience.",
      "Mark my words, Alexander will not come,  said the old princess.",
      "That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by\ntrain, and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too.",
      "And I know why,  the princess went on;  he says that young people\nought to be left alone for a while at first.",
      "But papa has left us alone.",
      "We ve never seen him,  said Kitty.",
      "Besides, we re not young people!",
      "we re old, married people by now.",
      "Only if he doesn t come, I shall say good-bye to you children,  said\nthe princess, sighing mournfully.",
      "What nonsense, mamma!",
      "both the daughters fell upon her at once.",
      "How do you suppose he is feeling?",
      "Why, now.... \n\nAnd suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess s voice.",
      "Her daughters were silent, and looked at one another.",
      "Maman always\nfinds something to be miserable about,  they said in that glance.",
      "They\ndid not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter s house,\nand useful as she felt herself to be there, she had been extremely\nmiserable, both on her own account and her husband s, ever since they\nhad married their last and favorite daughter, and the old home had been\nleft empty.",
      "What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?",
      "Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea\nMihalovna, who was standing with a mysterious air, and a face full of\nmeaning.",
      "About supper.",
      "Well, that s right,  said Dolly;  you go and arrange about it, and\nI ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing\ndone all day.",
      "That s my lesson!",
      "No, Dolly, I m going,  said Levin, jumping up.",
      "Grisha, who was by now at a high school, had to go over the lessons of\nthe term in the summer holidays.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, who had been\nstudying Latin with her son in Moscow before, had made it a rule on\ncoming to the Levins  to go over with him, at least once a day, the\nmost difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic.",
      "Levin had offered to\ntake her place, but the mother, having once overheard Levin s lesson,\nand noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had\ngiven it, said resolutely, though with much embarrassment and anxiety\nnot to mortify Levin, that they must keep strictly to the book as the\nteacher had done, and that she had better undertake it again herself.",
      "Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch, who, by neglecting his\nduty, threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had\nno comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so\nbadly.",
      "But he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as\nshe wished.",
      "And he went on teaching Grisha, not in his own way, but by\nthe book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour\nof the lesson.",
      "So it had been today.",
      "No, I m going, Dolly, you sit still,  he said.",
      "We ll do it all\nproperly, like the book.",
      "Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting,\nthen we shall have to miss it.",
      "And Levin went to Grisha.",
      "Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty.",
      "Even in the happy,\nwell-ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making\nherself useful.",
      "I ll see to the supper, you sit still,  she said, and got up to go to\nAgafea Mihalovna.",
      "Yes, yes, most likely they ve not been able to get chickens.",
      "If so,\nours.... \n\n Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,  and Varenka vanished with\nher.",
      "What a nice girl!",
      "said the princess.",
      "Not nice, maman; she s an exquisite girl; there s no one else like\nher.",
      "So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?",
      "said Sergey\nIvanovitch, evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about\nVarenka.",
      "It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike\nthan yours,  he said with a subtle smile.",
      "One all movement, only\nliving in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively,\nalert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either\nsinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.",
      "Yes, he s very heedless,  said the princess, addressing Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "I ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that\nit s out of the question for her  (she indicated Kitty)  to stay here;\nthat she positively must come to Moscow.",
      "He talks of getting a doctor\ndown.... \n\n Maman, he ll do everything; he has agreed to everything,  Kitty said,\nangry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in\nsuch a matter.",
      "In the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses\nand the sound of wheels on the gravel.",
      "Dolly had not time to get up to\ngo and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where\nGrisha was having his lesson, Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out\nafter him.",
      "It s Stiva!",
      "Levin shouted from under the balcony.",
      "We ve finished,\nDolly, don t be afraid!",
      "he added, and started running like a boy to\nmeet the carriage.",
      "_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_  shouted Grisha, skipping along the\navenue.",
      "And someone else too!",
      "Papa, of course!",
      "cried Levin, stopping at the\nentrance of the avenue.",
      "Kitty, don t come down the steep staircase, go\nround.",
      "But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the\ncarriage for the old prince.",
      "As he got nearer to the carriage he saw\nbeside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome, stout young\nman in a Scotch cap, with long ends of ribbon behind.",
      "This was Vassenka\nVeslovsky, a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys, a brilliant young\ngentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society.",
      "A capital fellow, and a\nkeen sportsman,  as Stepan Arkadyevitch said, introducing him.",
      "Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in\nplace of the old prince, Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily, claiming\nacquaintance with him in the past, and snatching up Grisha into the\ncarriage, lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had\nbrought with him.",
      "Levin did not get into the carriage, but walked behind.",
      "He was rather\nvexed at the non-arrival of the old prince, whom he liked more and more\nthe more he saw of him, and also at the arrival of this Vassenka\nVeslovsky, a quite uncongenial and superfluous person.",
      "He seemed to him\nstill more uncongenial and superfluous when, on approaching the steps\nwhere the whole party, children and grown-up, were gathered together in\nmuch excitement, Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky, with a particularly warm\nand gallant air, kissing Kitty s hand.",
      "Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,  said Vassenka\nVeslovsky, once more shaking Levin s hand with great warmth.",
      "Well, are there plenty of birds?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin,\nhardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings.",
      "We ve come\nwith the most savage intentions.",
      "Why, maman, they ve not been in Moscow\nsince!",
      "Look, Tanya, here s something for you!",
      "Get it, please, it s in\nthe carriage, behind!",
      "he talked in all directions.",
      "How pretty you ve\ngrown, Dolly,  he said to his wife, once more kissing her hand, holding\nit in one of his, and patting it with the other.",
      "Levin, who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind, now\nlooked darkly at everyone, and everything displeased him.",
      "Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?",
      "he thought, looking\nat Stepan Arkadyevitch s tender demonstrations to his wife.",
      "He looked\nat Dolly, and he did not like her either.",
      "She doesn t believe in his love.",
      "So what is she so pleased about?",
      "Revolting!",
      "thought Levin.",
      "He looked at the princess, who had been so dear to him a minute before,\nand he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka,\nwith his ribbons, just as though she were in her own house.",
      "Even Sergey Ivanovitch, who had come out too onto the steps, seemed to\nhim unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan\nArkadyevitch, though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor\nrespected Oblonsky.",
      "And Varenka, even she seemed hateful, with her air _sainte nitouche_\nmaking the acquaintance of this gentleman, while all the while she was\nthinking of nothing but getting married.",
      "And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of\ngaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country, as\nthough it were a holiday for himself and everyone else.",
      "And, above all,\nunpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his\nsmile.",
      "Noisily talking, they all went into the house; but as soon as they were\nall seated, Levin turned and went out.",
      "Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband.",
      "She tried to seize a\nmoment to speak to him alone, but he made haste to get away from her,\nsaying he was wanted at the counting-house.",
      "It was long since his own\nwork on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.",
      "It s all holiday for them,  he thought;  but these are no holiday\nmatters, they won t wait, and there s no living without them.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nLevin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to\nsupper.",
      "On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna,\nconsulting about wines for supper.",
      "But why are you making all this fuss?",
      "Have what we usually do.",
      "No, Stiva doesn t drink ... Kostya, stop, what s the matter?",
      "Kitty\nbegan, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the\ndining-room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively\ngeneral conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka\nVeslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?",
      "said Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "Please, do let s go,  said Veslovsky, moving to another chair, where\nhe sat down sideways, with one fat leg crossed under him.",
      "I shall be delighted, we will go.",
      "And have you had any shooting yet\nthis year?",
      "said Levin to Veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but\nspeaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him,\nand that was so out of keeping with him.",
      "I can t answer for our\nfinding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe.",
      "Only we ought to start\nearly.",
      "You re not tired?",
      "Aren t you tired, Stiva?",
      "Me tired?",
      "I ve never been tired yet.",
      "Suppose we stay up all night.",
      "Let s go for a walk!",
      "Yes, really, let s not go to bed at all!",
      "Capital!",
      "Veslovsky chimed\nin.",
      "Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up\ntoo,  Dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her\nvoice which she almost always had now with her husband.",
      "But to my\nthinking, it s time for bed now....",
      "I m going, I don t want supper.",
      "No, do stay a little, Dolly,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, going round to\nher side behind the table where they were having supper.",
      "I ve so much\nstill to tell you.",
      "Nothing really, I suppose.",
      "Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna s, and he s going to them\nagain?",
      "You know they re hardly fifty miles from you, and I too must\ncertainly go over there.",
      "Veslovsky, come here!",
      "Vassenka crossed over to the ladies, and sat down beside Kitty.",
      "Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her?",
      "How was she?",
      "Darya\nAlexandrovna appealed to him.",
      "Levin was left at the other end of the table, and though never pausing\nin his conversation with the princess and Varenka, he saw that there\nwas an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan\nArkadyevitch, Dolly, Kitty, and Veslovsky.",
      "And that was not all.",
      "He saw\non his wife s face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with\nfixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka, who was telling them\nsomething with great animation.",
      "It s exceedingly nice at their place,  Veslovsky was telling them\nabout Vronsky and Anna.",
      "I can t, of course, take it upon myself to\njudge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.",
      "What do they intend doing?",
      "I believe they think of going to Moscow.",
      "How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together!",
      "When are\nyou going there?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked Vassenka.",
      "I m spending July there.",
      "Will you go?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife.",
      "I ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,  said Dolly.",
      "I am sorry for her, and I know her.",
      "She s a splendid woman.",
      "I will go\nalone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one s way.",
      "And it\nwill be better indeed without you.",
      "To be sure,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And you, Kitty?",
      "I?",
      "Why should I go?",
      "Kitty said, flushing all over, and she glanced\nround at her husband.",
      "Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?",
      "Veslovsky asked her.",
      "She s a very\nfascinating woman.",
      "Yes,  she answered Veslovsky, crimsoning still more.",
      "She got up and\nwalked across to her husband.",
      "Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?",
      "she said.",
      "His jealousy had in these few moments, especially at the flush that had\noverspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky, gone far\nindeed.",
      "Now as he heard her words, he construed them in his own\nfashion.",
      "Strange as it was to him afterwards to recall it, it seemed to\nhim at the moment clear that in asking whether he was going shooting,\nall she cared to know was whether he would give that pleasure to\nVassenka Veslovsky, with whom, as he fancied, she was in love.",
      "Yes, I m going,  he answered her in an unnatural voice, disagreeable\nto himself.",
      "No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won t see anything of\nher husband, and set off the day after,  said Kitty.",
      "The motive of Kitty s words was interpreted by Levin thus:  Don t\nseparate me from _him_.",
      "I don t care about _your_ going, but do let me\nenjoy the society of this delightful young man.",
      "Oh, if you wish, we ll stay here tomorrow,  Levin answered, with\npeculiar amiability.",
      "Vassenka meanwhile, utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had\noccasioned, got up from the table after Kitty, and watching her with\nsmiling and admiring eyes, he followed her.",
      "Levin saw that look.",
      "He turned white, and for a minute he could hardly\nbreathe.",
      "How dare he look at my wife like that!",
      "was the feeling that\nboiled within him.",
      "Tomorrow, then?",
      "Do, please, let us go,  said Vassenka, sitting down on\na chair, and again crossing his leg as his habit was.",
      "Levin s jealousy went further still.",
      "Already he saw himself a deceived\nhusband, looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to\nprovide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life....",
      "But in\nspite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about\nhis shooting, his gun, and his boots, and agreed to go shooting next\nday.",
      "Happily for Levin, the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up\nherself and advising Kitty to go to bed.",
      "But even at this point Levin\ncould not escape another agony.",
      "As he said good-night to his hostess,\nVassenka would again have kissed her hand, but Kitty, reddening, drew\nback her hand and said with a na ve bluntness, for which the old\nprincess scolded her afterwards:\n\n We don t like that fashion.",
      "In Levin s eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to\narise, and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did\nnot like them.",
      "Why, how can one want to go to bed!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, who,\nafter drinking several glasses of wine at supper, was now in his most\ncharming and sentimental humor.",
      "Look, Kitty,  he said, pointing to the\nmoon, which had just risen behind the lime trees how exquisite!",
      "Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade.",
      "You know, he has a splendid\nvoice; we practiced songs together along the road.",
      "He has brought some\nlovely songs with him, two new ones.",
      "Varvara Andreevna and he must sing\nsome duets.",
      "When the party had broken up, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while\nabout the avenue with Veslovsky; their voices could be heard singing\none of the new songs.",
      "Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy-chair in his wife s\nbedroom, and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what\nwas wrong.",
      "But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the\nquestion:  Was there perhaps something you disliked about\nVeslovsky?",
      "it all burst out, and he told her all.",
      "He was humiliated\nhimself at what he was saying, and that exasperated him all the more.",
      "He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his\nscowling brows, and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest, as\nthough he were straining every nerve to hold himself in.",
      "The expression\nof his face would have been grim, and even cruel, if it had not at the\nsame time had a look of suffering which touched her.",
      "His jaws were\ntwitching, and his voice kept breaking.",
      "You must understand that I m not jealous, that s a nasty word.",
      "I can t\nbe jealous, and believe that....",
      "I can t say what I feel, but this is\nawful....",
      "I m not jealous, but I m wounded, humiliated that anybody\ndare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.",
      "Eyes like what?",
      "said Kitty, trying as conscientiously as possible to\nrecall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied\nin them.",
      "At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something\nprecisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other\nend of the table; but she dared not own it even to herself, and would\nhave been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him, and so\nincrease his suffering.",
      "And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...",
      "Ah!",
      "he cried, clutching at his head,  you shouldn t say that!...",
      "If\nyou had been attractive then.... \n\n Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!",
      "she said, looking\nat him with an expression of pained commiseration.",
      "Why, what can you\nbe thinking about!",
      "When for me there s no one in the world, no one, no\none!...",
      "Would you like me never to see anyone?",
      "For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy; she was\nangry that the slightest amusement, even the most innocent, should be\nforbidden her; but now she would readily have sacrificed, not merely\nsuch trifles, but everything, for his peace of mind, to save him from\nthe agony he was suffering.",
      "You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,  he went on\nin a desperate whisper;  that he s in my house, that he s done nothing\nimproper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits\non his legs.",
      "He thinks it s the best possible form, and so I m obliged\nto be civil to him.",
      "But, Kostya, you re exaggerating,  said Kitty, at the bottom of her\nheart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her, shown now in his\njealousy.",
      "The most awful part of it all is that you re just as you always are,\nand especially now when to me you re something sacred, and we re so\nhappy, so particularly happy and all of a sudden a little wretch....",
      "He s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him?",
      "I have nothing to do\nwith him.",
      "But why should my, and your, happiness.... \n\n Do you know, I understand now what it s all come from,  Kitty was\nbeginning.",
      "Well, what?",
      "what?",
      "I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.",
      "Well, well!",
      "Levin said in dismay.",
      "She told him what they had been talking about.",
      "And as she told him, she\nwas breathless with emotion.",
      "Levin was silent for a space, then he\nscanned her pale and distressed face, and suddenly he clutched at his\nhead.",
      "Katya, I ve been worrying you!",
      "Darling, forgive me!",
      "It s madness!",
      "Katya, I m a criminal.",
      "And how could you be so distressed at such\nidiocy?",
      "Oh, I was sorry for you.",
      "For me?",
      "for me?",
      "How mad I am!...",
      "But why make you miserable?",
      "It s\nawful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.",
      "It s humiliating too, of course.",
      "Oh, then I ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him\nwith civility,  said Levin, kissing her hands.",
      "You shall see.",
      "Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nNext day, before the ladies were up, the wagonette and a trap for the\nshooting party were at the door, and Laska, aware since early morning\nthat they were going shooting, after much whining and darting to and\nfro, had sat herself down in the wagonette beside the coachman, and,\ndisapproving of the delay, was excitedly watching the door from which\nthe sportsmen still did not come out.",
      "The first to come out was\nVassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his\nthick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather\ncartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new\nEnglish gun without a sling.",
      "Laska flew up to him, welcomed him, and\njumping up, asked him in her own way whether the others were coming\nsoon, but getting no answer from him, she returned to her post of\nobservation and sank into repose again, her head on one side, and one\near pricked up to listen.",
      "At last the door opened with a creak, and\nStepan Arkadyevitch s spot-and-tan pointer Krak flew out, running round\nand round and turning over in the air.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch himself\nfollowed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth.",
      "Good dog, good dog, Krak!",
      "he cried encouragingly to the dog, who put\nhis paws up on his chest, catching at his game bag.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch\nwas dressed in rough leggings and spats, in torn trousers and a short\ncoat.",
      "On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form, but\nhis gun of a new patent was a perfect gem, and his game bag and\ncartridge belt, though worn, were of the very best quality.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly _chic_\nfor a sportsman to be in tatters, but to have his shooting outfit of\nthe best quality.",
      "He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nradiant in his rags, graceful, well-fed, and joyous, a typical Russian\nnobleman.",
      "And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he\nwould certainly adopt the same get-up.",
      "Well, and what about our host?",
      "he asked.",
      "A young wife,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling.",
      "Yes, and such a charming one!",
      "He came down dressed.",
      "No doubt he s run up to her again.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right.",
      "Levin had run up again to his wife\nto ask her once more if she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday, and,\nmoreover, to beg her for Christ s sake to be more careful.",
      "The great\nthing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute\npush against her.",
      "Then he had once more to hear her declare that she\nwas not angry with him for going away for two days, and to beg her to\nbe sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback, to\nwrite him, if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was\nwell with her.",
      "Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of\ndays from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big\nand strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of\nsportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot\nher own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him\ncheerfully.",
      "Pardon, gentlemen!",
      "he said, running out onto the steps.",
      "Have you put\nthe lunch in?",
      "Why is the chestnut on the right?",
      "Well, it doesn t\nmatter.",
      "Laska, down; go and lie down!",
      "Put it with the herd of oxen,  he said to the herdsman, who was\nwaiting for him at the steps with some question.",
      "Excuse me, here comes\nanother villain.",
      "Levin jumped out of the wagonette, in which he had already taken his\nseat, to meet the carpenter, who came towards the steps with a rule in\nhis hand.",
      "You didn t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you re\ndetaining me.",
      "Well, what is it?",
      "Would your honor let me make another turning?",
      "It s only three steps to\nadd.",
      "And we make it just fit at the same time.",
      "It will be much more\nconvenient.",
      "You should have listened to me,  Levin answered with annoyance.",
      "I\nsaid: Put the lines and then fit in the steps.",
      "Now there s no setting\nit right.",
      "Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.",
      "The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had\nspoiled the staircase, fitting it together without calculating the\nspace it was to fill, so that the steps were all sloping when it was\nput in place.",
      "Now the carpenter wanted, keeping the same staircase, to\nadd three steps.",
      "It will be much better.",
      "But where s your staircase coming out with its three steps?",
      "Why, upon my word, sir,  the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile.",
      "It comes out right at the very spot.",
      "It starts, so to speak,  he said,\nwith a persuasive gesture;  it comes down, and comes down, and comes\nout.",
      "But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come\nout?",
      "Why, to be sure, it ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and\ncome out so,  the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly.",
      "It ll reach the ceiling and the wall.",
      "Upon my word!",
      "Why, it ll go up, and up, and come out like this.",
      "Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the\ndust.",
      "There, do you see?",
      "As your honor likes,  said the carpenter, with a sudden gleam in his\neyes, obviously understanding the thing at last.",
      "It seems it ll be\nbest to make a new one.",
      "Well, then, do it as you re told,  Levin shouted, seating himself in\nthe wagonette.",
      "Down!",
      "Hold the dogs, Philip!",
      "Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares\nsuch an eager sense of joy in life and expectation that he was not\ndisposed to talk.",
      "Besides that, he had that feeling of concentrated\nexcitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene\nof action.",
      "If he had anything on his mind at that moment, it was only\nthe doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh,\nwhether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak, and\nwhether he would shoot well that day himself.",
      "Not to disgrace himself\nbefore a new spectator not to be outdone by Oblonsky that too was a\nthought that crossed his brain.",
      "Oblonsky was feeling the same, and he too was not talkative.",
      "Vassenka\nVeslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter.",
      "As he\nlistened to him now, Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been\nto him the day before.",
      "Vassenka was really a nice fellow, simple,\ngood-hearted, and very good-humored.",
      "If Levin had met him before he was\nmarried, he would have made friends with him.",
      "Levin rather disliked his\nholiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of\nelegance.",
      "It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in\nhimself that could not be disputed, because he had long nails and a\nstylish cap, and everything else to correspond; but this could be\nforgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding.",
      "Levin liked\nhim for his good education, for speaking French and English with such\nan excellent accent, and for being a man of his world.",
      "Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse, a horse of the\nDon Steppes.",
      "He kept praising him enthusiastically.",
      "How fine it must\nbe galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse!",
      "Eh?",
      "isn t it?",
      "he\nsaid.",
      "He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and\nromantic, and it turned out nothing of the sort.",
      "But his simplicity,\nparticularly in conjunction with his good looks, his amiable smile, and\nthe grace of his movements, was very attractive.",
      "Either because his\nnature was sympathetic to Levin, or because Levin was trying to atone\nfor his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was\ngood in him, anyway he liked his society.",
      "After they had driven over two miles from home, Veslovsky all at once\nfelt for a cigar and his pocketbook, and did not know whether he had\nlost them or left them on the table.",
      "In the pocketbook there were\nthirty-seven pounds, and so the matter could not be left in\nuncertainty.",
      "Do you know what, Levin, I ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.",
      "That will be splendid.",
      "Eh?",
      "he said, preparing to get out.",
      "No, why should you?",
      "answered Levin, calculating that Vassenka could\nhardly weigh less than seventeen stone.",
      "I ll send the coachman.",
      "The coachman rode back on the trace-horse, and Levin himself drove the\nremaining pair.",
      "Chapter 9\n\n Well, now what s our plan of campaign?",
      "Tell us all about it,  said\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Our plan is this.",
      "Now we re driving to Gvozdyov.",
      "In Gvozdyov there s a\ngrouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent\nsnipe marshes where there are grouse too.",
      "It s hot now, and we ll get\nthere it s fifteen miles or so towards evening and have some evening\nshooting; we ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger\nmoors.",
      "And is there nothing on the way?",
      "Yes; but we ll reserve ourselves; besides it s hot.",
      "There are two nice\nlittle places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.",
      "Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places, but they\nwere near home; he could shoot them over any time, and they were only\nlittle places there would hardly be room for three to shoot.",
      "And so,\nwith some insincerity, he said that he doubted there being anything to\nshoot.",
      "When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by, but\nStepan Arkadyevitch, with the experienced eye of a sportsman, at once\ndetected reeds visible from the road.",
      "Shan t we try that?",
      "he said, pointing to the little marsh.",
      "Levin, do, please!",
      "how delightful!",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky began begging,\nand Levin could but consent.",
      "Before they had time to stop, the dogs had flown one before the other\ninto the marsh.",
      "Krak!",
      "Laska!...",
      "The dogs came back.",
      "There won t be room for three.",
      "I ll stay here,  said Levin, hoping\nthey would find nothing but peewits, who had been startled by the dogs,\nand turning over in their flight, were plaintively wailing over the\nmarsh.",
      "No!",
      "Come along, Levin, let s go together!",
      "Veslovsky called.",
      "Really, there s not room.",
      "Laska, back, Laska!",
      "You won t want another\ndog, will you?",
      "Levin remained with the wagonette, and looked enviously at the\nsportsmen.",
      "They walked right across the marsh.",
      "Except little birds and\npeewits, of which Vassenka killed one, there was nothing in the marsh.",
      "Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh,  said\nLevin,  only it s wasting time.",
      "Oh, no, it was jolly all the same.",
      "Did you see us?",
      "said Vassenka\nVeslovsky, clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his\npeewit in his hands.",
      "How splendidly I shot this bird!",
      "Didn t I?",
      "Well,\nshall we soon be getting to the real place?",
      "The horses started off suddenly, Levin knocked his head against the\nstock of someone s gun, and there was the report of a shot.",
      "The gun did\nactually go off first, but that was how it seemed to Levin.",
      "It appeared\nthat Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger, and had left the\nother hammer still cocked.",
      "The charge flew into the ground without\ndoing harm to anyone.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed\nreprovingly at Veslovsky.",
      "But Levin had not the heart to reprove him.",
      "In the first place, any reproach would have seemed to be called forth\nby the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin s\nforehead.",
      "And besides, Veslovsky was at first so na vely distressed,\nand then laughed so good-humoredly and infectiously at their general\ndismay, that one could not but laugh with him.",
      "When they reached the second marsh, which was fairly large, and would\ninevitably take some time to shoot over, Levin tried to persuade them\nto pass it by.",
      "But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him.",
      "Again, as the\nmarsh was narrow, Levin, like a good host, remained with the carriage.",
      "Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky was the\nfirst to run after the dog.",
      "Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come\nup, a grouse flew out.",
      "Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown\nmeadow.",
      "This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up.",
      "Krak found it\nagain and pointed, and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage.",
      "Now you go and I ll stay with the horses,  he said.",
      "Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman s envy.",
      "He handed the\nreins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh.",
      "Laska, who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the\ninjustice of her treatment, flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that\nLevin knew well, and that Krak had not yet come upon.",
      "Why don t you stop her?",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "She won t scare them,  answered Levin, sympathizing with his bitch s\npleasure and hurrying after her.",
      "As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was\nmore and more earnestness in Laska s exploration.",
      "A little marsh bird\ndid not divert her attention for more than an instant.",
      "She made one\ncircuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly\nquivered with excitement and became motionless.",
      "Come, come, Stiva!",
      "shouted Levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat\nmore violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had\nbeen drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud,\nbegan to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance.",
      "He heard\nthe steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the\nhorses in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on\nwhich he had trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse.",
      "He\nheard too, not far behind him, a splashing in the water, which he could\nnot explain to himself.",
      "Picking his steps, he moved up to the dog.",
      "Fetch it!",
      "Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog.",
      "Levin had lifted\nhis gun, but at the very instant when he was taking aim, the sound of\nsplashing grew louder, came closer, and was joined with the sound of\nVeslovsky s voice, shouting something with strange loudness.",
      "Levin saw\nhe had his gun pointed behind the snipe, but still he fired.",
      "When he had made sure he had missed, Levin looked round and saw the\nhorses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh.",
      "Veslovsky, eager to see the shooting, had driven into the marsh, and\ngot the horses stuck in the mud.",
      "Damn the fellow!",
      "Levin said to himself, as he went back to the\ncarriage that had sunk in the mire.",
      "What did you drive in for?",
      "he\nsaid to him dryly, and calling the coachman, he began pulling the\nhorses out.",
      "Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses\ngetting stuck in the mud, and still more at the fact that neither\nStepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to\nunharness the horses and get them out, since neither of them had the\nslightest notion of harnessing.",
      "Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply\nto Vassenka s protestations that it had been quite dry there, Levin\nworked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses.",
      "But\nthen, as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was\ntugging at the wagonette by one of the mud-guards, so that he broke it\nindeed, Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of\nyesterday s feelings been too cold to Veslovsky, and tried to be\nparticularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness.",
      "When\neverything had been put right, and the carriage had been brought back\nto the road, Levin had the lunch served.",
      "_Bon app tit bonne conscience!",
      "Ce poulet va tomber jusqu au fond de\nmes bottes_,  Vassenka, who had recovered his spirits, quoted the\nFrench saying as he finished his second chicken.",
      "Well, now our\ntroubles are over, now everything s going to go well.",
      "Only, to atone\nfor my sins, I m bound to sit on the box.",
      "That s so?",
      "eh?",
      "No, no!",
      "I ll\nbe your Automedon.",
      "You shall see how I ll get you along,  he answered,\nnot letting go the rein, when Levin begged him to let the coachman\ndrive.",
      "No, I must atone for my sins, and I m very comfortable on the\nbox.",
      "And he drove.",
      "Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses, especially the\nchestnut, whom he did not know how to hold in; but unconsciously he\nfell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he\nsang all the way on the box, or the descriptions and representations he\ngave of driving in the English fashion, four-in-hand; and it was in the\nvery best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nVassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too\nearly, while it was still hot.",
      "As they drew near this more important marsh, the chief aim of their\nexpedition, Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of\nVassenka and be free in his movements.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently\nhad the same desire, and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety\nalways present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting, together\nwith a certain good-humored slyness peculiar to him.",
      "How shall we go?",
      "It s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks, \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, pointing to two great birds hovering over the\nreeds.",
      "Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.",
      "Now, gentlemen,  said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the\nlock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression,  do you see those\nreeds?",
      "He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown\nwet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river.",
      "The marsh\nbegins here, straight in front of us, do you see where it is greener?",
      "From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding\nplaces there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that\nalder, and right up to the mill.",
      "Over there, do you see, where the\npools are?",
      "That s the best place.",
      "There I once shot seventeen snipe.",
      "We ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then\nmeet over there at the mill.",
      "Well, which shall go to left and which to right?",
      "asked Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "It s wider to the right; you two go that way and I ll\ntake the left,  he said with apparent carelessness.",
      "Capital!",
      "we ll make the bigger bag!",
      "Yes, come along, come along!",
      "Vassenka exclaimed.",
      "Levin could do nothing but agree, and they divided.",
      "As soon as they entered the marsh, the two dogs began hunting about\ntogether and made towards the green, slime-covered pool.",
      "Levin knew\nLaska s method, wary and indefinite; he knew the place too and expected\na whole covey of snipe.",
      "Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!",
      "he said in a faint voice to his\ncompanion splashing in the water behind him.",
      "Levin could not help\nfeeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed, after that\ncasual shot near the Kolpensky marsh.",
      "Oh, I won t get in your way, don t trouble about me.",
      "But Levin could not help troubling, and recalled Kitty s words at\nparting:  Mind you don t shoot one another.",
      "The dogs came nearer and\nnearer, passed each other, each pursuing its own scent.",
      "The expectation\nof snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own\nheel, as he drew it up out of the mire, seemed to be the call of a\nsnipe, and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun.",
      "Bang!",
      "bang!",
      "sounded almost in his ear.",
      "Vassenka had fired at a flock\nof ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment\ntowards the sportsmen, far out of range.",
      "Before Levin had time to look\nround, there was the whir of one snipe, another, a third, and some\neight more rose one after another.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning\nits zigzag movements, and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud.",
      "Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds,\nand together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it\ncould be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt\nwing showing white beneath.",
      "Levin was not so lucky: he aimed at his first bird too low, and missed;\nhe aimed at it again, just as it was rising, but at that instant\nanother snipe flew up at his very feet, distracting him so that he\nmissed again.",
      "While they were loading their guns, another snipe rose, and Veslovsky,\nwho had had time to load again, sent two charges of small-shot into the\nwater.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe, and with sparkling eyes\nlooked at Levin.",
      "Well, now let us separate,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and limping on\nhis left foot, holding his gun in readiness and whistling to his dog,\nhe walked off in one direction.",
      "Levin and Veslovsky walked in the\nother.",
      "It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure\nhe got hot and out of temper, and shot badly the whole day.",
      "So it was\nthat day.",
      "The snipe showed themselves in numbers.",
      "They kept flying up\nfrom just under the dogs, from under the sportsmen s legs, and Levin\nmight have retrieved his ill luck.",
      "But the more he shot, the more he\nfelt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky, who kept popping away merrily\nand indiscriminately, killing nothing, and not in the slightest abashed\nby his ill success.",
      "Levin, in feverish haste, could not restrain\nhimself, got more and more out of temper, and ended by shooting almost\nwithout a hope of hitting.",
      "Laska, indeed, seemed to understand this.",
      "She began looking more languidly, and gazed back at the sportsmen, as\nit were, with perplexity or reproach in her eyes.",
      "Shots followed shots\nin rapid succession.",
      "The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen,\nwhile in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three\nlight little snipe.",
      "And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky\nalone, and one by both of them together.",
      "Meanwhile from the other side\nof the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch s shots, not\nfrequent, but, as Levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each\nthey heard  Krak, Krak, _apporte_!",
      "This excited Levin still more.",
      "The snipe were floating continually in\nthe air over the reeds.",
      "Their whirring wings close to the earth, and\ntheir harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the\nsnipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again\nbefore the sportsmen.",
      "Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of\nthem hovering with shrill cries over the marsh.",
      "After walking through the larger half of the marsh, Levin and Veslovsky\nreached the place where the peasants  mowing-grass was divided into\nlong strips reaching to the reeds, marked off in one place by the\ntrampled grass, in another by a path mown through it.",
      "Half of these\nstrips had already been mown.",
      "Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as\nthe cut part, Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him, and\nso he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches.",
      "Hi, sportsmen!",
      "shouted one of a group of peasants, sitting on an\nunharnessed cart;  come and have some lunch with us!",
      "Have a drop of\nwine!",
      "Levin looked round.",
      "Come along, it s all right!",
      "shouted a good-humored-looking bearded\npeasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding\nup a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight.",
      "_Qu est-ce qu ils disent_?",
      "asked Veslovsky.",
      "They invite you to have some vodka.",
      "Most likely they ve been dividing\nthe meadow into lots.",
      "I should have some,  said Levin, not without some\nguile, hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka, and would go\naway to them.",
      "Why do they offer it?",
      "Oh, they re merry-making.",
      "Really, you should join them.",
      "You would be\ninterested.",
      "_Allons, c est curieux_.",
      "You go, you go, you ll find the way to the mill!",
      "cried Levin, and\nlooking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky, bent and\nstumbling with weariness, holding his gun out at arm s length, was\nmaking his way out of the marsh towards the peasants.",
      "You come too!",
      "the peasants shouted to Levin.",
      "Never fear!",
      "You taste\nour cake!",
      "Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some\nbread.",
      "He was exhausted, and felt it a great effort to drag his\nstaggering legs out of the mire, and for a minute he hesitated.",
      "But\nLaska was setting.",
      "And immediately all his weariness vanished, and he\nwalked lightly through the swamp towards the dog.",
      "A snipe flew up at\nhis feet; he fired and killed it.",
      "Laska still pointed.",
      "Fetch it!",
      "Another bird flew up close to the dog.",
      "Levin fired.",
      "But it was an\nunlucky day for him; he missed it, and when he went to look for the one\nhe had shot, he could not find that either.",
      "He wandered all about the\nreeds, but Laska did not believe he had shot it, and when he sent her\nto find it, she pretended to hunt for it, but did not really.",
      "And in\nthe absence of Vassenka, on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure,\nthings went no better.",
      "There were plenty of snipe still, but Levin made\none miss after another.",
      "The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes, soaked\nthrough with perspiration, stuck to his body; his left boot full of\nwater weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step; the sweat\nran in drops down his powder-grimed face, his mouth was full of the\nbitter taste, his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water, his\nears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe; he could not\ntouch the stock of his gun, it was so hot; his heart beat with short,\nrapid throbs; his hands shook with excitement, and his weary legs\nstumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp, but still he\nwalked on and still he shot.",
      "At last, after a disgraceful miss, he\nflung his gun and his hat on the ground.",
      "No, I must control myself,  he said to himself.",
      "Picking up his gun and\nhis hat, he called Laska, and went out of the swamp.",
      "When he got on to\ndry ground he sat down, pulled off his boot and emptied it, then walked\nto the marsh, drank some stagnant-tasting water, moistened his burning\nhot gun, and washed his face and hands.",
      "Feeling refreshed, he went back\nto the spot where a snipe had settled, firmly resolved to keep cool.",
      "He tried to be calm, but it was the same again.",
      "His finger pressed the\ncock before he had taken a good aim at the bird.",
      "It got worse and\nworse.",
      "He had only five birds in his game-bag when he walked out of the marsh\ntowards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog.",
      "Krak\ndarted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over\nwith the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror\nsniffed at Laska.",
      "Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the\nalder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "He came to meet\nhim, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the\nsame way.",
      "Well?",
      "You have been popping away!",
      "he said, smiling good-humoredly.",
      "How have you got on?",
      "queried Levin.",
      "But there was no need to ask, for\nhe had already seen the full game bag.",
      "Oh, pretty fair.",
      "He had fourteen birds.",
      "A splendid marsh!",
      "I ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way.",
      "It s\nawkward too, shooting with one dog,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, to\nsoften his triumph.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nWhen Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant s hut where\nLevin always used to stay, Veslovsky was already there.",
      "He was sitting\nin the middle of the hut, clinging with both hands to the bench from\nwhich he was being pulled by a soldier, the brother of the peasant s\nwife, who was helping him off with his miry boots.",
      "Veslovsky was\nlaughing his infectious, good-humored laugh.",
      "I ve only just come.",
      "_Ils ont  t  charmants_.",
      "Just fancy, they gave me\ndrink, fed me!",
      "Such bread, it was exquisite!",
      "_D licieux!_ And the\nvodka, I never tasted any better.",
      "And they would not take a penny for\nanything.",
      "And they kept saying:  Excuse our homely ways.",
      "What should they take anything for?",
      "They were entertaining you, to be\nsure.",
      "Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?",
      "said the soldier,\nsucceeding at last in pulling the soaked boot off the blackened\nstocking.",
      "In spite of the dirtiness of the hut, which was all muddied by their\nboots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean, and the smell of\nmarsh mud and powder that filled the room, and the absence of knives\nand forks, the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish\nonly known to sportsmen.",
      "Washed and clean, they went into a hay-barn\nswept ready for them, where the coachman had been making up beds for\nthe gentlemen.",
      "Though it was dusk, not one of them wanted to go to sleep.",
      "After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns, of dogs, and\nof former shooting parties, the conversation rested on a topic that\ninterested all of them.",
      "After Vassenka had several times over expressed\nhis appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant\nhay, this delightful broken cart (he supposed it to be broken because\nthe shafts had been taken out), of the good nature of the peasants that\nhad treated him to vodka, of the dogs who lay at the feet of their\nrespective masters, Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful\nshooting party at Malthus s, where he had stayed the previous summer.",
      "Malthus was a well-known capitalist, who had made his money by\nspeculation in railway shares.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch described what\ngrouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province, and how they\nwere preserved, and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting\nparty had been driven, and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged\nup at the marsh.",
      "I don t understand you,  said Levin, sitting up in the hay;  how is it\nsuch people don t disgust you?",
      "I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is\nall very pleasant, but don t you dislike just that very sumptuousness?",
      "All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get\ntheir money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone.",
      "They\ndon t care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains\nto buy off the contempt they have deserved.",
      "Perfectly true!",
      "chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky.",
      "Perfectly!",
      "Oblonsky,\nof course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say:  Well,\nOblonsky stays with them.",
      "... \n\n Not a bit of it.",
      "Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he\nspoke.",
      "I simply don t consider him more dishonest than any other\nwealthy merchant or nobleman.",
      "They ve all made their money alike by\ntheir work and their intelligence.",
      "Oh, by what work?",
      "Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and\nspeculate with them?",
      "Of course it s work.",
      "Work in this sense, that if it were not for him\nand others like him, there would have been no railways.",
      "But that s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned\nprofession.",
      "Granted, but it s work in the sense that his activity produces a\nresult the railways.",
      "But of course you think the railways useless.",
      "No, that s another question; I am prepared to admit that they re\nuseful.",
      "But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended\nis dishonest.",
      "But who is to define what is proportionate?",
      "Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,  said Levin, conscious\nthat he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty.",
      "Such as banking, for instance,  he went on.",
      "It s an evil the amassing\nof huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit\nmonopolies, it s only the form that s changed.",
      "_Le roi est mort, vive\nle roi_.",
      "No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the\nrailways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without\nwork.",
      "Yes, that may all be very true and clever....",
      "Lie down, Krak!",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch called to his dog, who was scratching and turning over all\nthe hay.",
      "He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position,\nand so talked serenely and without haste.",
      "But you have not drawn the\nline between honest and dishonest work.",
      "That I receive a bigger salary\nthan my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I\ndo that s dishonest, I suppose?",
      "I can t say.",
      "Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let s\nsay, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here,\nhowever hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just\nas dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus\ngetting more than a station-master.",
      "No, quite the contrary; I see that\nsociety takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which\nis utterly baseless, and I fancy there s envy at the bottom of it.... \n\n No, that s unfair,  said Veslovsky;  how could envy come in?",
      "There is\nsomething not nice about that sort of business.",
      "You say,  Levin went on,  that it s unjust for me to receive five\nthousand, while the peasant has fifty; that s true.",
      "It is unfair, and I\nfeel it, but....",
      "It really is.",
      "Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting,\ndoing nothing, while they are forever at work?",
      "said Vassenka\nVeslovsky, obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the\nquestion, and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity.",
      "Yes, you feel it, but you don t give him your property,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, intentionally, as it seemed, provoking Levin.",
      "There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the\ntwo brothers-in-law; as though, since they had married sisters, a kind\nof rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life\nbest, and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation, as it\nbegan to take a personal note.",
      "I don t give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I\nwanted to, I could not give it away,  answered Levin,  and have no one\nto give it to.",
      "Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.",
      "Yes, but how am I to give it up?",
      "Am I to go to him and make a deed of\nconveyance?",
      "I don t know; but if you are convinced that you have no right....",
      "I m not at all convinced.",
      "On the contrary, I feel I have no right to\ngive it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.",
      "No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is\nit you don t act accordingly?...",
      "Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to\nincrease the difference of position existing between him and me.",
      "No, excuse me, that s a paradox.",
      "Yes, there s something of a sophistry about that,  Veslovsky agreed.",
      "Ah!",
      "our host; so you re not asleep yet?",
      "he said to the peasant who\ncame into the barn, opening the creaking door.",
      "How is it you re not\nasleep?",
      "No, how s one to sleep!",
      "I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I\nheard them chattering.",
      "I want to get a hook from here.",
      "She won t bite?",
      "he added, stepping cautiously with his bare feet.",
      "And where are you going to sleep?",
      "We are going out for the night with the beasts.",
      "Ah, what a night!",
      "said Veslovsky, looking out at the edge of the hut\nand the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of\nthe evening glow in the great frame of the open doors.",
      "But listen,\nthere are women s voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too.",
      "Who s\nthat singing, my friend?",
      "That s the maids from hard by here.",
      "Let s go, let s have a walk!",
      "We shan t go to sleep, you know.",
      "Oblonsky, come along!",
      "If one could only do both, lie here and go,  answered Oblonsky,\nstretching.",
      "It s capital lying here.",
      "Well, I shall go by myself,  said Veslovsky, getting up eagerly, and\nputting on his shoes and stockings.",
      "Good-bye, gentlemen.",
      "If it s fun,\nI ll fetch you.",
      "You ve treated me to some good sport, and I won t\nforget you.",
      "He really is a capital fellow, isn t he?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nwhen Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after\nhim.",
      "Yes, capital,  answered Levin, still thinking of the subject of their\nconversation just before.",
      "It seemed to him that he had clearly\nexpressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity, and\nyet both of them, straightforward men and not fools, had said with one\nvoice that he was comforting himself with sophistries.",
      "This\ndisconcerted him.",
      "It s just this, my dear boy.",
      "One must do one of two things: either\nadmit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for\none s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust\nprivileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.",
      "No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be\nsatisfied at least I could not.",
      "The great thing for me is to feel that\nI m not to blame.",
      "What do you say, why not go after all?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nevidently weary of the strain of thought.",
      "We shan t go to sleep, you\nknow.",
      "Come, let s go!",
      "Levin did not answer.",
      "What they had said in the conversation, that he\nacted justly only in a negative sense, absorbed his thoughts.",
      "Can it\nbe that it s only possible to be just negatively?",
      "he was asking\nhimself.",
      "How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, getting up.",
      "There s not a chance of sleeping.",
      "Vassenka\nhas been getting up some fun there.",
      "Do you hear the laughing and his\nvoice?",
      "Hadn t we better go?",
      "Come along!",
      "No, I m not coming,  answered Levin.",
      "Surely that s not a matter of principle too,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, smiling, as he felt about in the dark for his cap.",
      "It s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?",
      "But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, finding his cap and getting up.",
      "How so?",
      "Do you suppose I don t see the line you ve taken up with your wife?",
      "I\nheard how it s a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not\nyou re to be away for a couple of days  shooting.",
      "That s all very well\nas an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won t answer.",
      "A man\nmust be independent; he has his masculine interests.",
      "A man has to be\nmanly,  said Oblonsky, opening the door.",
      "In what way?",
      "To go running after servant girls?",
      "said Levin.",
      "Why not, if it amuses him?",
      "_ a ne tire pas   cons quence_.",
      "It won t do\nmy wife any harm, and it ll amuse me.",
      "The great thing is to respect the\nsanctity of the home.",
      "There should be nothing in the home.",
      "But don t\ntie your own hands.",
      "Perhaps so,  said Levin dryly, and he turned on his side.",
      "Tomorrow,\nearly, I want to go shooting, and I won t wake anyone, and shall set\noff at daybreak.",
      "_Messieurs, venez vite!_  they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming\nback.",
      "_Charmante!_ I ve made such a discovery.",
      "_Charmante!_ a perfect\nGretchen, and I ve already made friends with her.",
      "Really, exceedingly\npretty,  he declared in a tone of approval, as though she had been made\npretty entirely on his account, and he was expressing his satisfaction\nwith the entertainment that had been provided for him.",
      "Levin pretended to be asleep, while Oblonsky, putting on his slippers,\nand lighting a cigar, walked out of the barn, and soon their voices\nwere lost.",
      "For a long while Levin could not get to sleep.",
      "He heard the horses\nmunching hay, then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready\nfor the night, and going off for the night watch with the beasts, then\nhe heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn,\nwith his nephew, the younger son of their peasant host.",
      "He heard the\nboy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about\nthe dogs, who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures, and asking\nwhat the dogs were going to hunt next day, and the soldier in a husky,\nsleepy voice, telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to\nthe marsh, and would shoot with their guns; and then, to check the\nboy s questions, he said,  Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you ll\ncatch it,  and soon after he began snoring himself, and everything was\nstill.",
      "He could only hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry\nof a snipe.",
      "Is it really only negative?",
      "he repeated to himself.",
      "Well, what of\nit?",
      "It s not my fault.",
      "And he began thinking about the next day.",
      "Tomorrow I ll go out early, and I ll make a point of keeping cool.",
      "There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too.",
      "When I come back\nthere ll be the note from Kitty.",
      "Yes, Stiva may be right, I m not manly\nwith her, I m tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can t be helped!",
      "Negative again.... \n\nHalf asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and\nStepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "For an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was\nup, and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they\nwere standing talking.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the\nfreshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and\nVeslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words, probably\nsaid to him by a peasant:  Ah, you do your best to get round her!",
      "Levin, half asleep, said:\n\n Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!",
      "and fell asleep.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nWaking up at earliest dawn, Levin tried to wake his companions.",
      "Vassenka, lying on his stomach, with one leg in a stocking thrust out,\nwas sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response.",
      "Oblonsky,\nhalf asleep, declined to get up so early.",
      "Even Laska, who was asleep,\ncurled up in the hay, got up unwillingly, and lazily stretched out and\nstraightened her hind legs one after the other.",
      "Getting on his boots\nand stockings, taking his gun, and carefully opening the creaking door\nof the barn, Levin went out into the road.",
      "The coachmen were sleeping\nin their carriages, the horses were dozing.",
      "Only one was lazily eating\noats, dipping its nose into the manger.",
      "It was still gray out-of-doors.",
      "Why are you up so early, my dear?",
      "the old woman, their hostess, said,\ncoming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old\nfriend.",
      "Going shooting, granny.",
      "Do I go this way to the marsh?",
      "Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp\npatches; there s a little footpath.",
      "Stepping carefully with her\nsunburnt, bare feet, the old woman conducted Levin, and moved back the\nfence for him by the threshing floor.",
      "Straight on and you ll come to the marsh.",
      "Our lads drove the cattle\nthere yesterday evening.",
      "Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path.",
      "Levin followed her\nwith a light, rapid step, continually looking at the sky.",
      "He hoped the\nsun would not be up before he reached the marsh.",
      "But the sun did not\ndelay.",
      "The moon, which had been bright when he went out, by now shone\nonly like a crescent of quicksilver.",
      "The pink flush of dawn, which one\ncould not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at\nall.",
      "What were before undefined, vague blurs in the distant countryside\ncould now be distinctly seen.",
      "They were sheaves of rye.",
      "The dew, not\nvisible till the sun was up, wetted Levin s legs and his blouse above\nhis belt in the high growing, fragrant hemp patch, from which the\npollen had already fallen out.",
      "In the transparent stillness of morning\nthe smallest sounds were audible.",
      "A bee flew by Levin s ear with the\nwhizzing sound of a bullet.",
      "He looked carefully, and saw a second and a\nthird.",
      "They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge, and\nthey disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh.",
      "The\npath led straight to the marsh.",
      "The marsh could be recognized by the\nmist which rose from it, thicker in one place and thinner in another,\nso that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist.",
      "At the edge of the marsh and the road, peasant boys and men, who had\nbeen herding for the night, were lying, and in the dawn all were asleep\nunder their coats.",
      "Not far from them were three hobbled horses.",
      "One of\nthem clanked a chain.",
      "Laska walked beside her master, pressing a little\nforward and looking round.",
      "Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching\nthe first reeds, Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off.",
      "One of\nthe horses, a sleek, dark-brown three-year-old, seeing the dog, started\naway, switched its tail and snorted.",
      "The other horses too were\nfrightened, and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs,\nand drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound,\nthey bounded out of the marsh.",
      "Laska stopped, looking ironically at the\nhorses and inquiringly at Levin.",
      "Levin patted Laska, and whistled as a\nsign that she might begin.",
      "Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under\nher.",
      "Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots, marsh\nplants, and slime, and the extraneous smell of horse dung, Laska\ndetected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh, the scent of\nthat strong-smelling bird that always excited her more than any other.",
      "Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very\nstrong, but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew\nstronger or fainter.",
      "To find the direction, she had to go farther away\nfrom the wind.",
      "Not feeling the motion of her legs, Laska bounded with a\nstiff gallop, so that at each bound she could stop short, to the right,\naway from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise, and turned\nfacing the wind.",
      "Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils, she felt at\nonce that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before\nher, and not one, but many.",
      "Laska slackened her speed.",
      "They were here,\nbut where precisely she could not yet determine.",
      "To find the very spot,\nshe began to make a circle, when suddenly her master s voice drew her\noff.",
      "Laska!",
      "here?",
      "he asked, pointing her to a different direction.",
      "She stopped, asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had\nbegun.",
      "But he repeated his command in an angry voice, pointing to a\nspot covered with water, where there could not be anything.",
      "She obeyed\nhim, pretending she was looking, so as to please him, went round it,\nand went back to her former position, and was at once aware of the\nscent again.",
      "Now when he was not hindering her, she knew what to do,\nand without looking at what was under her feet, and to her vexation\nstumbling over a high stump into the water, but righting herself with\nher strong, supple legs, she began making the circle which was to make\nall clear to her.",
      "The scent of them reached her, stronger and stronger,\nand more and more defined, and all at once it became perfectly clear to\nher that one of them was here, behind this tuft of reeds, five paces in\nfront of her; she stopped, and her whole body was still and rigid.",
      "On\nher short legs she could see nothing in front of her, but by the scent\nshe knew it was sitting not more than five paces off.",
      "She stood still,\nfeeling more and more conscious of it, and enjoying it in anticipation.",
      "Her tail was stretched straight and tense, and only wagging at the\nextreme end.",
      "Her mouth was slightly open, her ears raised.",
      "One ear had\nbeen turned wrong side out as she ran up, and she breathed heavily but\nwarily, and still more warily looked round, but more with her eyes than\nher head, to her master.",
      "He was coming along with the face she knew so\nwell, though the eyes were always terrible to her.",
      "He stumbled over the\nstump as he came, and moved, as she thought, extraordinarily slowly.",
      "She thought he came slowly, but he was running.",
      "Noticing Laska s special attitude as she crouched on the ground, as it\nwere, scratching big prints with her hind paws, and with her mouth\nslightly open, Levin knew she was pointing at grouse, and with an\ninward prayer for luck, especially with the first bird, he ran up to\nher.",
      "Coming quite close up to her, he could from his height look beyond\nher, and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose.",
      "In a\nspace between two little thickets, at a couple of yards  distance, he\ncould see a grouse.",
      "Turning its head, it was listening.",
      "Then lightly\npreening and folding its wings, it disappeared round a corner with a\nclumsy wag of its tail.",
      "Fetch it, fetch it!",
      "shouted Levin, giving Laska a shove from behind.",
      "But I can t go,  thought Laska.",
      "Where am I to go?",
      "From here I feel\nthem, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or\nwho they are.",
      "But then he shoved her with his knee, and in an excited\nwhisper said,  Fetch it, Laska.",
      "Well, if that s what he wishes, I ll do it, but I can t answer for\nmyself now,  she thought, and darted forward as fast as her legs would\ncarry her between the thick bushes.",
      "She scented nothing now; she could\nonly see and hear, without understanding anything.",
      "Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and\nthe peculiar round sound of its wings.",
      "And immediately after the shot\nit splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire.",
      "Another bird\ndid not linger, but rose behind Levin without the dog.",
      "When Levin\nturned towards it, it was already some way off.",
      "But his shot caught it.",
      "Flying twenty paces further, the second grouse rose upwards, and\nwhirling round like a ball, dropped heavily on a dry place.",
      "Come, this is going to be some good!",
      "thought Levin, packing the warm\nand fat grouse into his game bag.",
      "Eh, Laska, will it be good?",
      "When Levin, after loading his gun, moved on, the sun had fully risen,\nthough unseen behind the storm-clouds.",
      "The moon had lost all of its\nluster, and was like a white cloud in the sky.",
      "Not a single star could\nbe seen.",
      "The sedge, silvery with dew before, now shone like gold.",
      "The\nstagnant pools were all like amber.",
      "The blue of the grass had changed\nto yellow-green.",
      "The marsh birds twittered and swarmed about the brook\nand upon the bushes that glittered with dew and cast long shadows.",
      "A\nhawk woke up and settled on a haycock, turning its head from side to\nside and looking discontentedly at the marsh.",
      "Crows were flying about\nthe field, and a bare-legged boy was driving the horses to an old man,\nwho had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair.",
      "The\nsmoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass.",
      "One of the boys ran up to Levin.",
      "Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!",
      "he shouted to him, and he\nwalked a little way off behind him.",
      "And Levin was doubly pleased, in sight of the boy, who expressed his\napproval, at killing three snipe, one after another, straight off.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nThe sportsman s saying, that if the first beast or the first bird is\nnot missed, the day will be lucky, turned out correct.",
      "At ten o clock Levin, weary, hungry, and happy after a tramp of twenty\nmiles, returned to his night s lodging with nineteen head of fine game\nand one duck, which he tied to his belt, as it would not go into the\ngame bag.",
      "His companions had long been awake, and had had time to get\nhungry and have breakfast.",
      "Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,  said Levin,\ncounting a second time over the grouse and snipe, that looked so much\nless important now, bent and dry and bloodstained, with heads crooked\naside, than they did when they were flying.",
      "The number was verified, and Stepan Arkadyevitch s envy pleased Levin.",
      "He was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a\nnote was already there.",
      "I am perfectly well and happy.",
      "If you were uneasy about me, you can\nfeel easier than ever.",
      "I ve a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna, this was\nthe midwife, a new and important personage in Levin s domestic life.",
      "She has come to have a look at me.",
      "She found me perfectly well, and we\nhave kept her till you are back.",
      "All are happy and well, and please,\ndon t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay\nanother day.",
      "These two pleasures, his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife,\nwere so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly\nover Levin.",
      "One was that the chestnut trace horse, who had been\nunmistakably overworked on the previous day, was off his feed and out\nof sorts.",
      "The coachman said he was  Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin\nDmitrievitch.",
      "Yes, indeed!",
      "driven ten miles with no sense!",
      "The other unpleasant incident, which for the first minute destroyed his\ngood humor, though later he laughed at it a great deal, was to find\nthat of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that\none would have thought there was enough for a week, nothing was left.",
      "On his way back, tired and hungry from shooting, Levin had so distinct\na vision of meat-pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell\nand taste them, as Laska had smelt the game, and he immediately told\nPhilip to give him some.",
      "It appeared that there were no pies left, nor\neven any chicken.",
      "Well, this fellow s appetite!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, laughing and\npointing at Vassenka Veslovsky.",
      "I never suffer from loss of appetite,\nbut he s really marvelous!...",
      "Well, it can t be helped,  said Levin, looking gloomily at Veslovsky.",
      "Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.",
      "The beef s been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs,  answered\nPhilip.",
      "Levin was so hurt that he said, in a tone of vexation,  You might have\nleft me something!",
      "and he felt ready to cry.",
      "Then put away the game,  he said in a shaking voice to Philip, trying\nnot to look at Vassenka,  and cover them with some nettles.",
      "And you\nmight at least ask for some milk for me.",
      "But when he had drunk some milk, he felt ashamed immediately at having\nshown his annoyance to a stranger, and he began to laugh at his hungry\nmortification.",
      "In the evening they went shooting again, and Veslovsky had several\nsuccessful shots, and in the night they drove home.",
      "Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been.",
      "Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the\npeasants, who had regaled him with vodka, and said to him,  Excuse our\nhomely ways,  and his night s adventures with kiss-in-the-ring and the\nservant-girl and the peasant, who had asked him was he married, and on\nlearning that he was not, said to him,  Well, mind you don t run after\nother men s wives you d better get one of your own.",
      "These words had\nparticularly amused Veslovsky.",
      "Altogether, I ve enjoyed our outing awfully.",
      "And you, Levin?",
      "I have, very much,  Levin said quite sincerely.",
      "It was particularly\ndelightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling\ntowards Vassenka Veslovsky at home, and to feel instead the most\nfriendly disposition to him.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nNext day at ten o clock Levin, who had already gone his rounds, knocked\nat the room where Vassenka had been put for the night.",
      "_Entrez!_  Veslovsky called to him.",
      "Excuse me, I ve only just\nfinished my ablutions,  he said, smiling, standing before him in his\nunderclothes only.",
      "Don t mind me, please.",
      "Levin sat down in the window.",
      "Have you slept\nwell?",
      "Like the dead.",
      "What sort of day is it for shooting?",
      "What will you take, tea or coffee?",
      "Neither.",
      "I ll wait till lunch.",
      "I m really ashamed.",
      "I suppose the\nladies are down?",
      "A walk now would be capital.",
      "You show me your horses.",
      "After walking about the garden, visiting the stable, and even doing\nsome gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars, Levin returned\nto the house with his guest, and went with him into the drawing-room.",
      "We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!",
      "said\nVeslovsky, going up to Kitty, who was sitting at the samovar.",
      "What a\npity ladies are cut off from these delights!",
      "Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house,  Levin\nsaid to himself.",
      "Again he fancied something in the smile, in the\nall-conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty....",
      "The princess, sitting on the other side of the table with Marya\nVlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch, called Levin to her side, and began\nto talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty s confinement, and\ngetting ready rooms for them.",
      "Just as Levin had disliked all the\ntrivial preparations for his wedding, as derogatory to the grandeur of\nthe event, now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the\napproaching birth, the date of which they reckoned, it seemed, on their\nfingers.",
      "He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best\npatterns of long clothes for the coming baby; tried to turn away and\navoid seeing the mysterious, endless strips of knitting, the triangles\nof linen, and so on, to which Dolly attached special importance.",
      "The\nbirth of a son (he was certain it would be a son) which was promised\nhim, but which he still could not believe in so marvelous it\nseemed presented itself to his mind, on one hand, as a happiness so\nimmense, and therefore so incredible; on the other, as an event so\nmysterious, that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would\nbe, and consequent preparation for it, as for something ordinary that\ndid happen to people, jarred on him as confusing and humiliating.",
      "But the princess did not understand his feelings, and put down his\nreluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference,\nand so she gave him no peace.",
      "She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch\nto look at a flat, and now she called Levin up.",
      "I know nothing about it, princess.",
      "Do as you think fit,  he said.",
      "You must decide when you will move.",
      "I really don t know.",
      "I know millions of children are born away from\nMoscow, and doctors ... why....",
      "But if so.... \n\n Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.",
      "We can t talk to Kitty about it!",
      "Do you want me to frighten her?",
      "Why,\nthis spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.",
      "I will do just what you say,  he said gloomily.",
      "The princess began talking to him, but he did not hear her.",
      "Though the\nconversation with the princess had indeed jarred upon him, he was\ngloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at\nthe samovar.",
      "No, it s impossible,  he thought, glancing now and then at Vassenka\nbending over Kitty, telling her something with his charming smile, and\nat her, flushed and disturbed.",
      "There was something not nice in Vassenka s attitude, in his eyes, in\nhis smile.",
      "Levin even saw something not nice in Kitty s attitude and\nlook.",
      "And again the light died away in his eyes.",
      "Again, as before, all\nof a sudden, without the slightest transition, he felt cast down from a\npinnacle of happiness, peace, and dignity, into an abyss of despair,\nrage, and humiliation.",
      "Again everything and everyone had become hateful\nto him.",
      "You do just as you think best, princess,  he said again, looking\nround.",
      "Heavy is the cap of Monomach,  Stepan Arkadyevitch said playfully,\nhinting, evidently, not simply at the princess s conversation, but at\nthe cause of Levin s agitation, which he had noticed.",
      "How late you are today, Dolly!",
      "Everyone got up to greet Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Vassenka only rose for an\ninstant, and with the lack of courtesy to ladies characteristic of the\nmodern young man, he scarcely bowed, and resumed his conversation\nagain, laughing at something.",
      "I ve been worried about Masha.",
      "She did not sleep well, and is\ndreadfully tiresome today,  said Dolly.",
      "The conversation Vassenka had started with Kitty was running on the\nsame lines as on the previous evening, discussing Anna, and whether\nlove is to be put higher than worldly considerations.",
      "Kitty disliked\nthe conversation, and she was disturbed both by the subject and the\ntone in which it was conducted, and also by the knowledge of the effect\nit would have on her husband.",
      "But she was too simple and innocent to\nknow how to cut short this conversation, or even to conceal the\nsuperficial pleasure afforded her by the young man s very obvious\nadmiration.",
      "She wanted to stop it, but she did not know what to do.",
      "Whatever she did she knew would be observed by her husband, and the\nworst interpretation put on it.",
      "And, in fact, when she asked Dolly what\nwas wrong with Masha, and Vassenka, waiting till this uninteresting\nconversation was over, began to gaze indifferently at Dolly, the\nquestion struck Levin as an unnatural and disgusting piece of\nhypocrisy.",
      "What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?",
      "said\nDolly.",
      "By all means, please, and I shall come too,  said Kitty, and she\nblushed.",
      "She wanted from politeness to ask Vassenka whether he would\ncome, and she did not ask him.",
      "Where are you going, Kostya?",
      "she asked\nher husband with a guilty face, as he passed by her with a resolute\nstep.",
      "This guilty air confirmed all his suspicions.",
      "The mechanician came when I was away; I haven t seen him yet,  he\nsaid, not looking at her.",
      "He went downstairs, but before he had time to leave his study he heard\nhis wife s familiar footsteps running with reckless speed to him.",
      "What do you want?",
      "he said to her shortly.",
      "We are busy.",
      "I beg your pardon,  she said to the German mechanician;  I want a few\nwords with my husband.",
      "The German would have left the room, but Levin said to him:\n\n Don t disturb yourself.",
      "The train is at three?",
      "queried the German.",
      "I mustn t be late.",
      "Levin did not answer him, but walked out himself with his wife.",
      "Well, what have you to say to me?",
      "he said to her in French.",
      "He did not look her in the face, and did not care to see that she in\nher condition was trembling all over, and had a piteous, crushed look.",
      "I ...",
      "I want to say that we can t go on like this; that this is\nmisery....  she said.",
      "The servants are here at the sideboard,  he said angrily;  don t make\na scene.",
      "Well, let s go in here!",
      "They were standing in the passage.",
      "Kitty would have gone into the next\nroom, but there the English governess was giving Tanya a lesson.",
      "Well, come into the garden.",
      "In the garden they came upon a peasant weeding the path.",
      "And no longer\nconsidering that the peasant could see her tear-stained and his\nagitated face, that they looked like people fleeing from some disaster,\nthey went on with rapid steps, feeling that they must speak out and\nclear up misunderstandings, must be alone together, and so get rid of\nthe misery they were both feeling.",
      "We can t go on like this!",
      "It s misery!",
      "I am wretched; you are\nwretched.",
      "What for?",
      "she said, when they had at last reached a solitary\ngarden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue.",
      "But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, not\nnice, humiliatingly horrible?",
      "he said, standing before her again in\nthe same position with his clenched fists on his chest, as he had stood\nbefore her that night.",
      "Yes,  she said in a shaking voice;  but, Kostya, surely you see I m\nnot to blame?",
      "All the morning I ve been trying to take a tone ... but\nsuch people.... Why did he come?",
      "How happy we were!",
      "she said,\nbreathless with the sobs that shook her.",
      "Although nothing had been pursuing them, and there was nothing to run\naway from, and they could not possibly have found anything very\ndelightful on that garden seat, the gardener saw with astonishment that\nthey passed him on their way home with comforted and radiant faces.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nAfter escorting his wife upstairs, Levin went to Dolly s part of the\nhouse.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, for her part, was in great distress too that\nday.",
      "She was walking about the room, talking angrily to a little girl,\nwho stood in the corner roaring.",
      "And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all\nalone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won t make you a new\nfrock,  she said, not knowing how to punish her.",
      "Oh, she is a disgusting child!",
      "she turned to Levin.",
      "Where does she\nget such wicked propensities?",
      "Why, what has she done?",
      "Levin said without much interest, for he had\nwanted to ask her advice, and so was annoyed that he had come at an\nunlucky moment.",
      "Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ...",
      "I can t tell\nyou really what she did.",
      "It s a thousand pities Miss Elliot s not with\nus.",
      "This one sees to nothing she s a machine.... _Figurez-vous que la\npetite_?...",
      "And Darya Alexandrovna described Masha s crime.",
      "That proves nothing; it s not a question of evil propensities at all,\nit s simply mischief,  Levin assured her.",
      "But you are upset about something?",
      "What have you come for?",
      "asked\nDolly.",
      "What s going on there?",
      "And in the tone of her question Levin heard that it would be easy for\nhim to say what he had meant to say.",
      "I ve not been in there, I ve been alone in the garden with Kitty.",
      "We ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.",
      "Dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.",
      "Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but in\nthat gentleman s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant not\nunpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?",
      "You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!",
      "she said to\nMasha, who, detecting a faint smile in her mother s face, had been\nturning round.",
      "The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving\nas young men do behave.",
      "_Il fait la cour   une jeune et jolie femme_,\nand a husband who s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.",
      "Yes, yes,  said Levin gloomily;  but you noticed it?",
      "Not only I, but Stiva noticed it.",
      "Just after breakfast he said to me\nin so many words, _Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour  \nKitty_.",
      "Well, that s all right then; now I m satisfied.",
      "I ll send him away, \nsaid Levin.",
      "What do you mean!",
      "Are you crazy?",
      "Dolly cried in horror;  nonsense,\nKostya, only think!",
      "she said, laughing.",
      "You can go now to Fanny,  she\nsaid to Masha.",
      "No, if you wish it, I ll speak to Stiva.",
      "He ll take him\naway.",
      "He can say you re expecting visitors.",
      "Altogether he doesn t fit\ninto the house.",
      "No, no, I ll do it myself.",
      "But you ll quarrel with him?",
      "Not a bit.",
      "I shall so enjoy it,  Levin said, his eyes flashing with\nreal enjoyment.",
      "Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won t do it again,  he\nsaid of the little sinner, who had not gone to Fanny, but was standing\nirresolutely before her mother, waiting and looking up from under her\nbrows to catch her mother s eye.",
      "The mother glanced at her.",
      "The child broke into sobs, hid her face on\nher mother s lap, and Dolly laid her thin, tender hand on her head.",
      "And what is there in common between us and him?",
      "thought Levin, and he\nwent off to look for Veslovsky.",
      "As he passed through the passage he gave orders for the carriage to be\ngot ready to drive to the station.",
      "The spring was broken yesterday,  said the footman.",
      "Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste.",
      "Where s the visitor?",
      "The gentleman s gone to his room.",
      "Levin came upon Veslovsky at the moment when the latter, having\nunpacked his things from his trunk, and laid out some new songs, was\nputting on his gaiters to go out riding.",
      "Whether there was something exceptional in Levin s face, or that\nVassenka was himself conscious that _ce petit brin de cour_ he was\nmaking was out of place in this family, but he was somewhat (as much as\na young man in society can be) disconcerted at Levin s entrance.",
      "You ride in gaiters?",
      "Yes, it s much cleaner,  said Vassenka, putting his fat leg on a\nchair, fastening the bottom hook, and smiling with simple-hearted good\nhumor.",
      "He was undoubtedly a good-natured fellow, and Levin felt sorry for him\nand ashamed of himself, as his host, when he saw the shy look on\nVassenka s face.",
      "On the table lay a piece of stick which they had broken together that\nmorning, trying their strength.",
      "Levin took the fragment in his hands\nand began smashing it up, breaking bits off the stick, not knowing how\nto begin.",
      "I wanted....",
      "He paused, but suddenly, remembering Kitty and\neverything that had happened, he said, looking him resolutely in the\nface:  I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.",
      "How so?",
      "Vassenka began in surprise.",
      "To drive where?",
      "For you to drive to the station,  Levin said gloomily.",
      "Are you going away, or has something happened?",
      "It happens that I expect visitors,  said Levin, his strong fingers\nmore and more rapidly breaking off the ends of the split stick.",
      "And\nI m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to\ngo away.",
      "You can explain my rudeness as you like.",
      "Vassenka drew himself up.",
      "I beg you to explain....  he said with dignity, understanding at last.",
      "I can t explain,  Levin said softly and deliberately, trying to\ncontrol the trembling of his jaw;  and you d better not ask.",
      "And as the split ends were all broken off, Levin clutched the thick\nends in his finger, broke the stick in two, and carefully caught the\nend as it fell.",
      "Probably the sight of those nervous fingers, of the muscles he had\nproved that morning at gymnastics, of the glittering eyes, the soft\nvoice, and quivering jaws, convinced Vassenka better than any words.",
      "He\nbowed, shrugging his shoulders, and smiling contemptuously.",
      "Can I not see Oblonsky?",
      "The shrug and the smile did not irritate Levin.",
      "What else was there for him to do?",
      "he thought.",
      "I ll send him to you at once.",
      "What madness is this?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said when, after hearing\nfrom his friend that he was being turned out of the house, he found\nLevin in the garden, where he was walking about waiting for his guest s\ndeparture.",
      "_Mais c est ridicule!_ What fly has stung you?",
      "_Mais c est\ndu dernier ridicule!_ What did you think, if a young man....",
      "But the place where Levin had been stung was evidently still sore, for\nhe turned pale again, when Stepan Arkadyevitch would have enlarged on\nthe reason, and he himself cut him short.",
      "Please don t go into it!",
      "I can t help it.",
      "I feel ashamed of how I m\ntreating you and him.",
      "But it won t be, I imagine, a great grief to him\nto go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.",
      "But it s insulting to him!",
      "_Et puis c est ridicule_.",
      "And to me it s both insulting and distressing!",
      "And I m not at fault in\nany way, and there s no need for me to suffer.",
      "Well, this I didn t expect of you!",
      "_On peut  tre jaloux, mais   ce\npoint, c est du dernier ridicule!_ \n\nLevin turned quickly, and walked away from him into the depths of the\navenue, and he went on walking up and down alone.",
      "Soon he heard the\nrumble of the trap, and saw from behind the trees how Vassenka, sitting\nin the hay (unluckily there was no seat in the trap) in his Scotch cap,\nwas driven along the avenue, jolting up and down over the ruts.",
      "What s this?",
      "Levin thought, when a footman ran out of the house and\nstopped the trap.",
      "It was the mechanician, whom Levin had totally\nforgotten.",
      "The mechanician, bowing low, said something to Veslovsky,\nthen clambered into the trap, and they drove off together.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch and the princess were much upset by Levin s action.",
      "And he himself felt not only in the highest degree _ridicule_, but also\nutterly guilty and disgraced.",
      "But remembering what sufferings he and\nhis wife had been through, when he asked himself how he should act\nanother time, he answered that he should do just the same again.",
      "In spite of all this, towards the end of that day, everyone except the\nprincess, who could not pardon Levin s action, became extraordinarily\nlively and good-humored, like children after a punishment or grown-up\npeople after a dreary, ceremonious reception, so that by the evening\nVassenka s dismissal was spoken of, in the absence of the princess, as\nthough it were some remote event.",
      "And Dolly, who had inherited her\nfather s gift of humorous storytelling, made Varenka helpless with\nlaughter as she related for the third and fourth time, always with\nfresh humorous additions, how she had only just put on her new shoes\nfor the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing-room,\nheard suddenly the rumble of the trap.",
      "And who should be in the trap\nbut Vassenka himself, with his Scotch cap, and his songs and his\ngaiters, and all, sitting in the hay.",
      "If only you d ordered out the carriage!",
      "But no!",
      "and then I hear:\n Stop!",
      "Oh, I thought they ve relented.",
      "I look out, and behold a fat\nGerman being sat down by him and driving away.... And my new shoes all\nfor nothing!...",
      "Chapter 16\n\nDarya Alexandrovna carried out her intention and went to see Anna.",
      "She\nwas sorry to annoy her sister and to do anything Levin disliked.",
      "She\nquite understood how right the Levins were in not wishing to have\nanything to do with Vronsky.",
      "But she felt she must go and see Anna, and\nshow her that her feelings could not be changed, in spite of the change\nin her position.",
      "That she might be independent of the Levins in this\nexpedition, Darya Alexandrovna sent to the village to hire horses for\nthe drive; but Levin learning of it went to her to protest.",
      "What makes you suppose that I dislike your going?",
      "But, even if I did\ndislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses,  he\nsaid.",
      "You never told me that you were going for certain.",
      "Hiring horses\nin the village is disagreeable to me, and, what s of more importance,\nthey ll undertake the job and never get you there.",
      "I have horses.",
      "And\nif you don t want to wound me, you ll take mine.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had to consent, and on the day fixed Levin had ready\nfor his sister-in-law a set of four horses and relays, getting them\ntogether from the farm and saddle-horses not at all a smart-looking\nset, but capable of taking Darya Alexandrovna the whole distance in a\nsingle day.",
      "At that moment, when horses were wanted for the princess,\nwho was going, and for the midwife, it was a difficult matter for Levin\nto make up the number, but the duties of hospitality would not let him\nallow Darya Alexandrovna to hire horses when staying in his house.",
      "Moreover, he was well aware that the twenty roubles that would be asked\nfor the journey were a serious matter for her; Darya Alexandrovna s\npecuniary affairs, which were in a very unsatisfactory state, were\ntaken to heart by the Levins as if they were their own.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, by Levin s advice, started before daybreak.",
      "The\nroad was good, the carriage comfortable, the horses trotted along\nmerrily, and on the box, besides the coachman, sat the counting-house\nclerk, whom Levin was sending instead of a groom for greater security.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna dozed and waked up only on reaching the inn where\nthe horses were to be changed.",
      "After drinking tea at the same well-to-do peasant s with whom Levin had\nstayed on the way to Sviazhsky s, and chatting with the women about\ntheir children, and with the old man about Count Vronsky, whom the\nlatter praised very highly, Darya Alexandrovna, at ten o clock, went on\nagain.",
      "At home, looking after her children, she had no time to think.",
      "So now, after this journey of four hours, all the thoughts she had\nsuppressed before rushed swarming into her brain, and she thought over\nall her life as she never had before, and from the most different\npoints of view.",
      "Her thoughts seemed strange even to herself.",
      "At first\nshe thought about the children, about whom she was uneasy, although the\nprincess and Kitty (she reckoned more upon her) had promised to look\nafter them.",
      "If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha\nisn t kicked by a horse, and Lily s stomach isn t upset again!",
      "she\nthought.",
      "But these questions of the present were succeeded by questions\nof the immediate future.",
      "She began thinking how she had to get a new\nflat in Moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing-room\nfurniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak.",
      "Then questions of the\nmore remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children\nin the world.",
      "The girls are all right,  she thought;  but the boys?",
      "It s very well that I m teaching Grisha, but of course that s only\nbecause I am free myself now, I m not with child.",
      "Stiva, of course,\nthere s no counting on.",
      "And with the help of good-natured friends I can\nbring them up; but if there s another baby coming?...",
      "And the thought\nstruck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was\nthat in sorrow she should bring forth children.",
      "The birth itself, that s nothing; but the months of carrying the\nchild that s what s so intolerable,  she thought, picturing to herself\nher last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby.",
      "And she recalled\nthe conversation she had just had with the young woman at the inn.",
      "On\nbeing asked whether she had any children, the handsome young woman had\nanswered cheerfully:\n\n I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.",
      "Well, did you grieve very much for her?",
      "asked Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Why grieve?",
      "The old man has grandchildren enough as it is.",
      "It was only\na trouble.",
      "No working, nor nothing.",
      "Only a tie.",
      "This answer had struck Darya Alexandrovna as revolting in spite of the\ngood-natured and pleasing face of the young woman; but now she could\nnot help recalling these words.",
      "In those cynical words there was indeed\na grain of truth.",
      "Yes, altogether,  thought Darya Alexandrovna, looking back over her\nwhole existence during those fifteen years of her married life,\n pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything,\nand most of all hideousness.",
      "Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even\nKitty has lost her looks; and I when I m with child become hideous, I\nknow it.",
      "The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment\n... then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains.... \n\nDarya Alexandrovna shuddered at the mere recollection of the pain from\nsore breasts which she had suffered with almost every child.",
      "Then the\nchildren s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them\nup; evil propensities  (she thought of little Masha s crime among the\nraspberries),  education, Latin it s all so incomprehensible and\ndifficult.",
      "And on the top of it all, the death of these children.",
      "And\nthere rose again before her imagination the cruel memory, that always\ntore her mother s heart, of the death of her last little baby, who had\ndied of croup; his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the\nlittle pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at\nthe sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the\nopen, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it\nwas being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it.",
      "And all this, what s it for?",
      "What is to come of it all?",
      "That I m\nwasting my life, never having a moment s peace, either with child, or\nnursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and\nworrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are\ngrowing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.",
      "Even now, if it\nweren t for spending the summer at the Levins , I don t know how we\nshould be managing to live.",
      "Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much\ntact that we don t feel it; but it can t go on.",
      "They ll have children,\nthey won t be able to keep us; it s a drag on them as it is.",
      "How is\npapa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us?",
      "So that I\ncan t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with\nthe help of other people, at the cost of humiliation.",
      "Why, even if we\nsuppose the greatest good luck, that the children don t die, and I\nbring them up somehow.",
      "At the very best they ll simply be decent\npeople.",
      "That s all I can hope for.",
      "And to gain simply that what\nagonies, what toil!...",
      "One s whole life ruined!",
      "Again she recalled\nwhat the young peasant woman had said, and again she was revolted at\nthe thought; but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of\nbrutal truth in the words.",
      "Is it far now, Mihail?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna asked the counting-house\nclerk, to turn her mind from thoughts that were frightening her.",
      "From this village, they say, it s five miles.",
      "The carriage drove\nalong the village street and onto a bridge.",
      "On the bridge was a crowd\nof peasant women with coils of ties for the sheaves on their shoulders,\ngaily and noisily chattering.",
      "They stood still on the bridge, staring\ninquisitively at the carriage.",
      "All the faces turned to Darya\nAlexandrovna looked to her healthy and happy, making her envious of\ntheir enjoyment of life.",
      "They re all living, they re all enjoying\nlife,  Darya Alexandrovna still mused when she had passed the peasant\nwomen and was driving uphill again at a trot, seated comfortably on the\nsoft springs of the old carriage,  while I, let out, as it were from\nprison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only\nlooking about me now for an instant.",
      "They all live; those peasant women\nand my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see all,\nbut not I.",
      "And they attack Anna.",
      "What for?",
      "am I any better?",
      "I have, anyway, a\nhusband I love not as I should like to love him, still I do love him,\nwhile Anna never loved hers.",
      "How is she to blame?",
      "She wants to live.",
      "God has put that in our hearts.",
      "Very likely I should have done the\nsame.",
      "Even to this day I don t feel sure I did right in listening to\nher at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow.",
      "I ought then\nto have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh.",
      "I might have\nloved and have been loved in reality.",
      "And is it any better as it is?",
      "I\ndon t respect him.",
      "He s necessary to me,  she thought about her\nhusband,  and I put up with him.",
      "Is that any better?",
      "At that time I\ncould still have been admired, I had beauty left me still,  Darya\nAlexandrovna pursued her thoughts, and she would have liked to look at\nherself in the looking-glass.",
      "She had a traveling looking-glass in her\nhandbag, and she wanted to take it out; but looking at the backs of the\ncoachman and the swaying counting-house clerk, she felt that she would\nbe ashamed if either of them were to look round, and she did not take\nout the glass.",
      "But without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not\ntoo late; and she thought of Sergey Ivanovitch, who was always\nparticularly attentive to her, of Stiva s good-hearted friend,\nTurovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the\nscarlatina, and was in love with her.",
      "And there was someone else, a\nquite young man, who her husband had told her it as a joke thought her\nmore beautiful than either of her sisters.",
      "And the most passionate and\nimpossible romances rose before Darya Alexandrovna s imagination.",
      "Anna\ndid quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it.",
      "She\nis happy, she makes another person happy, and she s not broken down as\nI am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to\nevery impression,  thought Darya Alexandrovna, and a sly smile curved\nher lips, for, as she pondered on Anna s love affair, Darya\nAlexandrovna constructed on parallel lines an almost identical love\naffair for herself, with an imaginary composite figure, the ideal man\nwho was in love with her.",
      "She, like Anna, confessed the whole affair to\nher husband.",
      "And the amazement and perplexity of Stepan Arkadyevitch at\nthis avowal made her smile.",
      "In such daydreams she reached the turning of the highroad that led to\nVozdvizhenskoe.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nThe coachman pulled up his four horses and looked round to the right,\nto a field of rye, where some peasants were sitting on a cart.",
      "The\ncounting-house clerk was just going to jump down, but on second\nthoughts he shouted peremptorily to the peasants instead, and beckoned\nto them to come up.",
      "The wind, that seemed to blow as they drove,\ndropped when the carriage stood still; gadflies settled on the steaming\nhorses that angrily shook them off.",
      "The metallic clank of a whetstone\nagainst a scythe, that came to them from the cart, ceased.",
      "One of the\npeasants got up and came towards the carriage.",
      "Well, you are slow!",
      "the counting-house clerk shouted angrily to the\npeasant who was stepping slowly with his bare feet over the ruts of the\nrough dry road.",
      "Come along, do!",
      "A curly-headed old man with a bit of bast tied round his hair, and his\nbent back dark with perspiration, came towards the carriage, quickening\nhis steps, and took hold of the mud-guard with his sunburnt hand.",
      "Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house?",
      "the count s?",
      "he repeated;  go on to\nthe end of this track.",
      "Then turn to the left.",
      "Straight along the avenue\nand you ll come right upon it.",
      "But whom do you want?",
      "The count\nhimself?",
      "Well, are they at home, my good man?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna said vaguely,\nnot knowing how to ask about Anna, even of this peasant.",
      "At home for sure,  said the peasant, shifting from one bare foot to\nthe other, and leaving a distinct print of five toes and a heel in the\ndust.",
      "Sure to be at home,  he repeated, evidently eager to talk.",
      "Only\nyesterday visitors arrived.",
      "There s a sight of visitors come.",
      "What do\nyou want?",
      "He turned round and called to a lad, who was shouting\nsomething to him from the cart.",
      "Oh!",
      "They all rode by here not long\nsince, to look at a reaping machine.",
      "They ll be home by now.",
      "And who\nwill you be belonging to?...",
      "We ve come a long way,  said the coachman, climbing onto the box.",
      "So\nit s not far?",
      "I tell you, it s just here.",
      "As soon as you get out....  he said,\nkeeping hold all the while of the carriage.",
      "A healthy-looking, broad-shouldered young fellow came up too.",
      "What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?",
      "he asked.",
      "I don t know, my boy.",
      "So you keep to the left, and you ll come right on it,  said the\npeasant, unmistakably loth to let the travelers go, and eager to\nconverse.",
      "The coachman started the horses, but they were only just turning off\nwhen the peasant shouted:  Stop!",
      "Hi, friend!",
      "Stop!",
      "called the two\nvoices.",
      "The coachman stopped.",
      "They re coming!",
      "They re yonder!",
      "shouted the peasant.",
      "See what a\nturn-out!",
      "he said, pointing to four persons on horseback, and two in a\n_char- -banc_, coming along the road.",
      "They were Vronsky with a jockey, Veslovsky and Anna on horseback, and\nPrincess Varvara and Sviazhsky in the _char- -banc_.",
      "They had gone out\nto look at the working of a new reaping machine.",
      "When the carriage stopped, the party on horseback were coming at a\nwalking pace.",
      "Anna was in front beside Veslovsky.",
      "Anna, quietly walking\nher horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her\nbeautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat,\nher full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and\nall the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly.",
      "For the first minute it seemed to her unsuitable for Anna to be on\nhorseback.",
      "The conception of riding on horseback for a lady was, in\nDarya Alexandrovna s mind, associated with ideas of youthful flirtation\nand frivolity, which, in her opinion, was unbecoming in Anna s\nposition.",
      "But when she had scrutinized her, seeing her closer, she was\nat once reconciled to her riding.",
      "In spite of her elegance, everything\nwas so simple, quiet, and dignified in the attitude, the dress and the\nmovements of Anna, that nothing could have been more natural.",
      "Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka\nVeslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs\nstretched out in front, obviously pleased with his own appearance.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna could not suppress a good-humored smile as she\nrecognized him.",
      "Behind rode Vronsky on a dark bay mare, obviously\nheated from galloping.",
      "He was holding her in, pulling at the reins.",
      "After him rode a little man in the dress of a jockey.",
      "Sviazhsky and\nPrincess Varvara in a new _char- -banc_ with a big, raven-black\ntrotting horse, overtook the party on horseback.",
      "Anna s face suddenly beamed with a joyful smile at the instant when, in\nthe little figure huddled in a corner of the old carriage, she\nrecognized Dolly.",
      "She uttered a cry, started in the saddle, and set her\nhorse into a gallop.",
      "On reaching the carriage she jumped off without\nassistance, and holding up her riding habit, she ran up to greet Dolly.",
      "I thought it was you and dared not think it.",
      "How delightful!",
      "You can t\nfancy how glad I am!",
      "she said, at one moment pressing her face against\nDolly and kissing her, and at the next holding her off and examining\nher with a smile.",
      "Here s a delightful surprise, Alexey!",
      "she said, looking round at\nVronsky, who had dismounted, and was walking towards them.",
      "Vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly.",
      "You wouldn t believe how glad we are to see you,  he said, giving\npeculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth\nin a smile.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky, without getting off his horse, took off his cap and\ngreeted the visitor by gleefully waving the ribbons over his head.",
      "That s Princess Varvara,  Anna said in reply to a glance of inquiry\nfrom Dolly as the _char- -banc_ drove up.",
      "Ah!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, and unconsciously her face betrayed her\ndissatisfaction.",
      "Princess Varvara was her husband s aunt, and she had long known her,\nand did not respect her.",
      "She knew that Princess Varvara had passed her\nwhole life toadying on her rich relations, but that she should now be\nsponging on Vronsky, a man who was nothing to her, mortified Dolly on\naccount of her kinship with her husband.",
      "Anna noticed Dolly s\nexpression, and was disconcerted by it.",
      "She blushed, dropped her riding\nhabit, and stumbled over it.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna went up to the _char- -banc_ and coldly greeted\nPrincess Varvara.",
      "Sviazhsky too she knew.",
      "He inquired how his queer\nfriend with the young wife was, and running his eyes over the\nill-matched horses and the carriage with its patched mud-guards,\nproposed to the ladies that they should get into the _char- -banc_.",
      "And I ll get into this vehicle,  he said.",
      "The horse is quiet, and the\nprincess drives capitally.",
      "No, stay as you were,  said Anna, coming up,  and we ll go in the\ncarriage,  and taking Dolly s arm, she drew her away.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna s eyes were fairly dazzled by the elegant carriage\nof a pattern she had never seen before, the splendid horses, and the\nelegant and gorgeous people surrounding her.",
      "But what struck her most\nof all was the change that had taken place in Anna, whom she knew so\nwell and loved.",
      "Any other woman, a less close observer, not knowing\nAnna before, or not having thought as Darya Alexandrovna had been\nthinking on the road, would not have noticed anything special in Anna.",
      "But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty, which is only found\nin women during the moments of love, and which she saw now in Anna s\nface.",
      "Everything in her face, the clearly marked dimples in her cheeks\nand chin, the line of her lips, the smile which, as it were, fluttered\nabout her face, the brilliance of her eyes, the grace and rapidity of\nher movements, the fulness of the notes of her voice, even the manner\nin which, with a sort of angry friendliness, she answered Veslovsky\nwhen he asked permission to get on her cob, so as to teach it to gallop\nwith the right leg foremost it was all peculiarly fascinating, and it\nseemed as if she were herself aware of it, and rejoicing in it.",
      "When both the women were seated in the carriage, a sudden embarrassment\ncame over both of them.",
      "Anna was disconcerted by the intent look of\ninquiry Dolly fixed upon her.",
      "Dolly was embarrassed because after\nSviazhsky s phrase about  this vehicle,  she could not help feeling\nashamed of the dirty old carriage in which Anna was sitting with her.",
      "The coachman Philip and the counting-house clerk were experiencing the\nsame sensation.",
      "The counting-house clerk, to conceal his confusion,\nbusied himself settling the ladies, but Philip the coachman became\nsullen, and was bracing himself not to be overawed in future by this\nexternal superiority.",
      "He smiled ironically, looking at the raven horse,\nand was already deciding in his own mind that this smart trotter in the\n_char- -banc_ was only good for _promenage_, and wouldn t do thirty\nmiles straight off in the heat.",
      "The peasants had all got up from the cart and were inquisitively and\nmirthfully staring at the meeting of the friends, making their comments\non it.",
      "They re pleased, too; haven t seen each other for a long while,  said\nthe curly-headed old man with the bast round his hair.",
      "I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart\nthe corn, that  ud be quick work!",
      "Look-ee!",
      "Is that a woman in breeches?",
      "said one of them, pointing to\nVassenka Veslovsky sitting in a side saddle.",
      "Nay, a man!",
      "See how smartly he s going it!",
      "Eh, lads!",
      "seems we re not going to sleep, then?",
      "What chance of sleep today!",
      "said the old man, with a sidelong look at\nthe sun.",
      "Midday s past, look-ee!",
      "Get your hooks, and come along!",
      "Chapter 18\n\nAnna looked at Dolly s thin, care-worn face, with its wrinkles filled\nwith dust from the road, and she was on the point of saying what she\nwas thinking, that is, that Dolly had got thinner.",
      "But, conscious that\nshe herself had grown handsomer, and that Dolly s eyes were telling her\nso, she sighed and began to speak about herself.",
      "You are looking at me,  she said,  and wondering how I can be happy in\nmy position?",
      "Well!",
      "it s shameful to confess, but I ...",
      "I m inexcusably\nhappy.",
      "Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you re\nfrightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the\nhorrors are no more.",
      "I have waked up.",
      "I have lived through the misery,\nthe dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we ve been\nhere, I ve been so happy!...",
      "she said, with a timid smile of inquiry\nlooking at Dolly.",
      "How glad I am!",
      "said Dolly smiling, involuntarily speaking more coldly\nthan she wanted to.",
      "I m very glad for you.",
      "Why haven t you written to\nme?",
      "Why?...",
      "Because I hadn t the courage.... You forget my position.... \n\n To me?",
      "Hadn t the courage?",
      "If you knew how I ...",
      "I look at.... \n\nDarya Alexandrovna wanted to express her thoughts of the morning, but\nfor some reason it seemed to her now out of place to do so.",
      "But of that we ll talk later.",
      "What s this, what are all these\nbuildings?",
      "she asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing\nto the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges\nof acacia and lilac.",
      "Quite a little town.",
      "But Anna did not answer.",
      "No, no!",
      "How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?",
      "she\nasked.",
      "I consider....  Darya Alexandrovna was beginning, but at that instant\nVassenka Veslovsky, having brought the cob to gallop with the right leg\nforemost, galloped past them, bumping heavily up and down in his short\njacket on the chamois leather of the side saddle.",
      "He s doing it, Anna\nArkadyevna!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Anna did not even glance at him; but again it seemed to Darya\nAlexandrovna out of place to enter upon such a long conversation in the\ncarriage, and so she cut short her thought.",
      "I don t think anything,  she said,  but I always loved you, and if one\nloves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as\none would like them to be.... \n\nAnna, taking her eyes off her friend s face and dropping her eyelids\n(this was a new habit Dolly had not seen in her before), pondered,\ntrying to penetrate the full significance of the words.",
      "And obviously\ninterpreting them as she would have wished, she glanced at Dolly.",
      "If you had any sins,  she said,  they would all be forgiven you for\nyour coming to see me and these words.",
      "And Dolly saw that tears stood in her eyes.",
      "She pressed Anna s hand in\nsilence.",
      "Well, what are these buildings?",
      "How many there are of them!",
      "After a\nmoment s silence she repeated her question.",
      "These are the servants  houses, barns, and stables,  answered Anna.",
      "And there the park begins.",
      "It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had\neverything renewed.",
      "He is very fond of this place, and, what I never\nexpected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it.",
      "But\nhis is such a rich nature!",
      "Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly.",
      "So\nfar from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest.",
      "He with\nhis temperament as I know it he has become careful and businesslike, a\nfirst-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management\nof the land.",
      "But only in that.",
      "When it s a question of tens of\nthousands, he doesn t think of money.",
      "She spoke with that gleefully\nsly smile with which women often talk of the secret characteristics\nonly known to them of those they love.",
      "Do you see that big building?",
      "that s the new hospital.",
      "I believe it will cost over a hundred\nthousand; that s his hobby just now.",
      "And do you know how it all came\nabout?",
      "The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a\ncheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly.",
      "Of\ncourse it was not really because of that, but everything together, he\nbegan this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about\nmoney.",
      "_C est une petitesse_, if you like, but I love him all the more\nfor it.",
      "And now you ll see the house in a moment.",
      "It was his\ngrandfather s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.",
      "How beautiful!",
      "said Dolly, looking with involuntary admiration at the\nhandsome house with columns, standing out among the different-colored\ngreens of the old trees in the garden.",
      "Isn t it fine?",
      "And from the house, from the top, the view is\nwonderful.",
      "They drove into a courtyard strewn with gravel and bright with flowers,\nin which two laborers were at work putting an edging of stones round\nthe light mould of a flower bed, and drew up in a covered entry.",
      "Ah, they re here already!",
      "said Anna, looking at the saddle horses,\nwhich were just being led away from the steps.",
      "It is a nice horse,\nisn t it?",
      "It s my cob; my favorite.",
      "Lead him here and bring me some\nsugar.",
      "Where is the count?",
      "she inquired of two smart footmen who\ndarted out.",
      "Ah, there he is!",
      "she said, seeing Vronsky coming to meet\nher with Veslovsky.",
      "Where are you going to put the princess?",
      "said Vronsky in French,\naddressing Anna, and without waiting for a reply, he once more greeted\nDarya Alexandrovna, and this time he kissed her hand.",
      "I think the big\nbalcony room.",
      "Oh, no, that s too far off!",
      "Better in the corner room, we shall see\neach other more.",
      "Come, let s go up,  said Anna, as she gave her\nfavorite horse the sugar the footman had brought her.",
      "_Et vous oubliez votre devoir_,  she said to Veslovsky, who came out\ntoo on the steps.",
      "_Pardon, j en ai tout plein les poches_,  he answered, smiling,\nputting his fingers in his waistcoat pocket.",
      "_Mais vous venez trop tard_,  she said, rubbing her handkerchief on\nher hand, which the horse had made wet in taking the sugar.",
      "Anna turned to Dolly.",
      "You can stay some time?",
      "For one day only?",
      "That s\nimpossible!",
      "I promised to be back, and the children....  said Dolly, feeling\nembarrassed both because she had to get her bag out of the carriage,\nand because she knew her face must be covered with dust.",
      "No, Dolly, darling!...",
      "Well, we ll see.",
      "Come along, come along!",
      "and\nAnna led Dolly to her room.",
      "That room was not the smart guest chamber Vronsky had suggested, but\nthe one of which Anna had said that Dolly would excuse it.",
      "And this\nroom, for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in\nwhich Dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best\nhotels abroad.",
      "Well, darling, how happy I am!",
      "Anna said, sitting down in her riding\nhabit for a moment beside Dolly.",
      "Tell me about all of you.",
      "Stiva I had\nonly a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children.",
      "How is my\nfavorite, Tanya?",
      "Quite a big girl, I expect?",
      "Yes, she s very tall,  Darya Alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised\nherself that she should respond so coolly about her children.",
      "We are\nhaving a delightful stay at the Levins ,  she added.",
      "Oh, if I had known,  said Anna,  that you do not despise me!...",
      "You\nmight have all come to us.",
      "Stiva s an old friend and a great friend of\nAlexey s, you know,  she added, and suddenly she blushed.",
      "Yes, but we are all....  Dolly answered in confusion.",
      "But in my delight I m talking nonsense.",
      "The one thing, darling, is\nthat I am so glad to have you!",
      "said Anna, kissing her again.",
      "You\nhaven t told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting\nto know.",
      "But I m glad you will see me as I am.",
      "The chief thing I\nshouldn t like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.",
      "I don t want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one\nharm but myself.",
      "I have the right to do that, haven t I?",
      "But it is a\nbig subject, and we ll talk over everything properly later.",
      "Now I ll go\nand dress and send a maid to you.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nLeft alone, Darya Alexandrovna, with a good housewife s eye, scanned\nher room.",
      "All she had seen in entering the house and walking through\nit, and all she saw now in her room, gave her an impression of wealth\nand sumptuousness and of that modern European luxury of which she had\nonly read in English novels, but had never seen in Russia and in the\ncountry.",
      "Everything was new from the new French hangings on the walls\nto the carpet which covered the whole floor.",
      "The bed had a spring\nmattress, and a special sort of bolster and silk pillowcases on the\nlittle pillows.",
      "The marble washstand, the dressing table, the little\nsofa, the tables, the bronze clock on the chimney piece, the window\ncurtains, and the _porti res_ were all new and expensive.",
      "The smart maid, who came in to offer her services, with her hair done\nup high, and a gown more fashionable than Dolly s, was as new and\nexpensive as the whole room.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna liked her neatness, her\ndeferential and obliging manners, but she felt ill at ease with her.",
      "She felt ashamed of her seeing the patched dressing jacket that had\nunluckily been packed by mistake for her.",
      "She was ashamed of the very\npatches and darned places of which she had been so proud at home.",
      "At\nhome it had been so clear that for six dressing jackets there would be\nneeded twenty-four yards of nainsook at sixteen pence the yard, which\nwas a matter of thirty shillings besides the cutting-out and making,\nand these thirty shillings had been saved.",
      "But before the maid she\nfelt, if not exactly ashamed, at least uncomfortable.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna had a great sense of relief when Annushka, whom she\nhad known for years, walked in.",
      "The smart maid was sent for to go to\nher mistress, and Annushka remained with Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "Annushka was obviously much pleased at that lady s arrival, and began\nto chatter away without a pause.",
      "Dolly observed that she was longing to\nexpress her opinion in regard to her mistress s position, especially as\nto the love and devotion of the count to Anna Arkadyevna, but Dolly\ncarefully interrupted her whenever she began to speak about this.",
      "I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady s dearer to me than anything.",
      "Well, it s not for us to judge.",
      "And, to be sure, there seems so much\nlove.... \n\n Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,  Darya\nAlexandrovna cut her short.",
      "Certainly.",
      "We ve two women kept specially for washing small things,\nbut most of the linen s done by machinery.",
      "The count goes into\neverything himself.",
      "Ah, what a husband!...",
      "Dolly was glad when Anna came in, and by her entrance put a stop to\nAnnushka s gossip.",
      "Anna had put on a very simple batiste gown.",
      "Dolly scrutinized that\nsimple gown attentively.",
      "She knew what it meant, and the price at which\nsuch simplicity was obtained.",
      "An old friend,  said Anna of Annushka.",
      "Anna was not embarrassed now.",
      "She was perfectly composed and at ease.",
      "Dolly saw that she had now completely recovered from the impression her\narrival had made on her, and had assumed that superficial, careless\ntone which, as it were, closed the door on that compartment in which\nher deeper feelings and ideas were kept.",
      "Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?",
      "asked Dolly.",
      "Annie?",
      "(This was what she called her little daughter Anna.)",
      "Very\nwell.",
      "She has got on wonderfully.",
      "Would you like to see her?",
      "Come, I ll\nshow her to you.",
      "We had a terrible bother,  she began telling her,\n over nurses.",
      "We had an Italian wet-nurse.",
      "A good creature, but so\nstupid!",
      "We wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her\nthat we ve gone on keeping her still.",
      "But how have you managed?...",
      "Dolly was beginning a question as to\nwhat name the little girl would have; but noticing a sudden frown on\nAnna s face, she changed the drift of her question.",
      "How did you manage?",
      "have you weaned her yet?",
      "But Anna had understood.",
      "You didn t mean to ask that?",
      "You meant to ask about her surname.",
      "Yes?",
      "That worries Alexey.",
      "She has no name that is, she s a Karenina,  said\nAnna, dropping her eyelids till nothing could be seen but the eyelashes\nmeeting.",
      "But we ll talk about all that later,  her face suddenly\nbrightening.",
      "Come, I ll show you her.",
      "_Elle est tr s gentille_.",
      "She\ncrawls now.",
      "In the nursery the luxury which had impressed Dolly in the whole house\nstruck her still more.",
      "There were little go-carts ordered from England,\nand appliances for learning to walk, and a sofa after the fashion of a\nbilliard table, purposely constructed for crawling, and swings and\nbaths, all of special pattern, and modern.",
      "They were all English,\nsolid, and of good make, and obviously very expensive.",
      "The room was\nlarge, and very light and lofty.",
      "When they went in, the baby, with nothing on but her little smock, was\nsitting in a little elbow chair at the table, having her dinner of\nbroth, which she was spilling all over her little chest.",
      "The baby was\nbeing fed, and the Russian nursery maid was evidently sharing her meal.",
      "Neither the wet-nurse nor the head-nurse were there; they were in the\nnext room, from which came the sound of their conversation in the queer\nFrench which was their only means of communication.",
      "Hearing Anna s voice, a smart, tall, English nurse with a disagreeable\nface and a dissolute expression walked in at the door, hurriedly\nshaking her fair curls, and immediately began to defend herself though\nAnna had not found fault with her.",
      "At every word Anna said, the English\nnurse said hurriedly several times,  Yes, my lady.",
      "The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little\nbody with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite\nof the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger.",
      "She\npositively envied the baby s healthy appearance.",
      "She was delighted,\ntoo, at the baby s crawling.",
      "Not one of her own children had crawled\nlike that.",
      "When the baby was put on the carpet and its little dress\ntucked up behind, it was wonderfully charming.",
      "Looking round like some\nlittle wild animal at the grown-up big people with her bright black\neyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her, and\nholding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms, and\nrapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step\nforward with her little arms.",
      "But the whole atmosphere of the nursery, and especially the English\nnurse, Darya Alexandrovna did not like at all.",
      "It was only on the\nsupposition that no good nurse would have entered so irregular a\nhousehold as Anna s that Darya Alexandrovna could explain to herself\nhow Anna with her insight into people could take such an\nunprepossessing, disreputable-looking woman as nurse to her child.",
      "Besides, from a few words that were dropped, Darya Alexandrovna saw at\nonce that Anna, the two nurses, and the child had no common existence,\nand that the mother s visit was something exceptional.",
      "Anna wanted to\nget the baby her plaything, and could not find it.",
      "Most amazing of all was the fact that on being asked how many teeth the\nbaby had, Anna answered wrong, and knew nothing about the two last\nteeth.",
      "I sometimes feel sorry I m so superfluous here,  said Anna, going out\nof the nursery and holding up her skirt so as to escape the plaything\nstanding in the doorway.",
      "It was very different with my first child.",
      "I expected it to be the other way,  said Darya Alexandrovna shyly.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?",
      "said Anna, screwing\nup her eyes, as though looking at something far away.",
      "But we ll talk\nabout that later.",
      "You wouldn t believe it, I m like a hungry beggar\nwoman when a full dinner is set before her, and she does not know what\nto begin on first.",
      "The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me\nwith you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don t know\nwhich subject to begin upon first.",
      "_Mais je ne vous ferai gr ce de\nrien_.",
      "I must have everything out with you.",
      "Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with\nus,  she went on.",
      "I ll begin with the ladies.",
      "Princess Varvara you\nknow her, and I know your opinion and Stiva s about her.",
      "Stiva says the\nwhole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie\nKaterina Pavlovna: that s all true; but she s a good-natured woman, and\nI am so grateful to her.",
      "In Petersburg there was a moment when a\nchaperon was absolutely essential for me.",
      "Then she turned up.",
      "But\nreally she is good-natured.",
      "She did a great deal to alleviate my\nposition.",
      "I see you don t understand all the difficulty of my position\n... there in Petersburg,  she added.",
      "Here I m perfectly at ease and\nhappy.",
      "Well, of that later on, though.",
      "Then Sviazhsky he s the marshal\nof the district, and he s a very good sort of a man, but he wants to\nget something out of Alexey.",
      "You understand, with his property, now\nthat we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great\ninfluence.",
      "Then there s Tushkevitch you have seen him, you know Betsy s\nadmirer.",
      "Now he s been thrown over and he s come to see us.",
      "As Alexey\nsays, he s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts\nthem for what they try to appear to be, _et puis il est comme il faut_,\nas Princess Varvara says.",
      "Then Veslovsky ... you know him.",
      "A very nice\nboy,  she said, and a sly smile curved her lips.",
      "What s this wild\nstory about him and the Levins?",
      "Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we\ndon t believe it.",
      "_Il est tr s gentil et na f_,  she said again with\nthe same smile.",
      "Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I\nvalue all these people.",
      "We have to have the house lively and gay, so\nthat Alexey may not long for any novelty.",
      "Then you ll see the steward a\nGerman, a very good fellow, and he understands his work.",
      "Alexey has a\nvery high opinion of him.",
      "Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a\nNihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a very good\ndoctor.",
      "Then the architect.... _Une petite cour!_ \n\n\nChapter 20\n\n Here s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her,  said\nAnna, coming out with Darya Alexandrovna onto the stone terrace where\nPrincess Varvara was sitting in the shade at an embroidery frame,\nworking at a cover for Count Alexey Kirillovitch s easy chair.",
      "She\nsays she doesn t want anything before dinner, but please order some\nlunch for her, and I ll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.",
      "Princess Varvara gave Dolly a cordial and rather patronizing reception,\nand began at once explaining to her that she was living with Anna\nbecause she had always cared more for her than her sister Katerina\nPavlovna, the aunt that had brought Anna up, and that now, when\neveryone had abandoned Anna, she thought it her duty to help her in\nthis most difficult period of transition.",
      "Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my\nsolitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however\ndifficult it may be for me not like some other people.",
      "And how sweet it\nis of you, how right of you to have come!",
      "They live like the best of\nmarried couples; it s for God to judge them, not for us.",
      "And didn t\nBiryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev\nand Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say anything\nabout them?",
      "And it has ended by their being received by everyone.",
      "And\nthen, _c est un int rieur si joli, si comme il faut.",
      "Tout- -fait  \nl anglaise.",
      "On se r unit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se s pare._\nEveryone does as he pleases till dinner time.",
      "Dinner at seven o clock.",
      "Stiva did very rightly to send you.",
      "He needs their support.",
      "You know\nthat through his mother and brother he can do anything.",
      "And then they\ndo so much good.",
      "He didn t tell you about his hospital?",
      "_Ce sera\nadmirable_ everything from Paris.",
      "Their conversation was interrupted by Anna, who had found the men of\nthe party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace.",
      "There was still a long time before the dinner-hour, it was exquisite\nweather, and so several different methods of spending the next two\nhours were proposed.",
      "There were very many methods of passing the time\nat Vozdvizhenskoe, and these were all unlike those in use at\nPokrovskoe.",
      "_Une partie de lawn-tennis,_  Veslovsky proposed, with his handsome\nsmile.",
      "We ll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "No, it s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the\nboat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.",
      "Vronsky proposed.",
      "I agree to anything,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll wouldn t\nyou?",
      "And then the boat, perhaps,  said Anna.",
      "So it was decided.",
      "Veslovsky and Tushkevitch went off to the bathing\nplace, promising to get the boat ready and to wait there for them.",
      "They walked along the path in two couples, Anna with Sviazhsky, and\nDolly with Vronsky.",
      "Dolly was a little embarrassed and anxious in the\nnew surroundings in which she found herself.",
      "Abstractly, theoretically,\nshe did not merely justify, she positively approved of Anna s conduct.",
      "As is indeed not unfrequent with women of unimpeachable virtue, weary\nof the monotony of respectable existence, at a distance she not only\nexcused illicit love, she positively envied it.",
      "Besides, she loved Anna\nwith all her heart.",
      "But seeing Anna in actual life among these\nstrangers, with this fashionable tone that was so new to Darya\nAlexandrovna, she felt ill at ease.",
      "What she disliked particularly was\nseeing Princess Varvara ready to overlook everything for the sake of\nthe comforts she enjoyed.",
      "As a general principle, abstractly, Dolly approved of Anna s action;\nbut to see the man for whose sake her action had been taken was\ndisagreeable to her.",
      "Moreover, she had never liked Vronsky.",
      "She thought\nhim very proud, and saw nothing in him of which he could be proud\nexcept his wealth.",
      "But against her own will, here in his own house, he\noverawed her more than ever, and she could not be at ease with him.",
      "She\nfelt with him the same feeling she had had with the maid about her\ndressing jacket.",
      "Just as with the maid she had felt not exactly\nashamed, but embarrassed at her darns, so she felt with him not exactly\nashamed, but embarrassed at herself.",
      "Dolly was ill at ease, and tried to find a subject of conversation.",
      "Even though she supposed that, through his pride, praise of his house\nand garden would be sure to be disagreeable to him, she did all the\nsame tell him how much she liked his house.",
      "Yes, it s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style, \nhe said.",
      "I like so much the court in front of the steps.",
      "Was that always so?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "he said, and his face beamed with pleasure.",
      "If you could\nonly have seen that court last spring!",
      "And he began, at first rather diffidently, but more and more carried\naway by the subject as he went on, to draw her attention to the various\ndetails of the decoration of his house and garden.",
      "It was evident that,\nhaving devoted a great deal of trouble to improve and beautify his\nhome, Vronsky felt a need to show off the improvements to a new person,\nand was genuinely delighted at Darya Alexandrovna s praise.",
      "If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed,\nit s not far.",
      "Shall we go?",
      "he said, glancing into her face to convince\nhimself that she was not bored.",
      "Are you coming, Anna?",
      "he turned to\nher.",
      "We will come, won t we?",
      "she said, addressing Sviazhsky.",
      "_Mais il ne\nfaut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre l \ndans le bateau._ We must send and tell them.",
      "Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here,  said Anna, turning to\nDolly with that sly smile of comprehension with which she had\npreviously talked about the hospital.",
      "Oh, it s a work of real importance!",
      "said Sviazhsky.",
      "But to show he\nwas not trying to ingratiate himself with Vronsky, he promptly added\nsome slightly critical remarks.",
      "I wonder, though, count,  he said,  that while you do so much for the\nhealth of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.",
      "_C est devenu tellement commun les  coles,_  said Vronsky.",
      "You\nunderstand it s not on that account, but it just happens so, my\ninterest has been diverted elsewhere.",
      "This way then to the hospital, \nhe said to Darya Alexandrovna, pointing to a turning out of the avenue.",
      "The ladies put up their parasols and turned into the side path.",
      "After\ngoing down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya\nAlexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large\npretentious-looking red building, almost finished.",
      "The iron roof, which\nwas not yet painted, shone with dazzling brightness in the sunshine.",
      "Beside the finished building another had been begun, surrounded by\nscaffolding.",
      "Workmen in aprons, standing on scaffolds, were laying\nbricks, pouring mortar out of vats, and smoothing it with trowels.",
      "How quickly work gets done with you!",
      "said Sviazhsky.",
      "When I was here\nlast time the roof was not on.",
      "By the autumn it will all be ready.",
      "Inside almost everything is done, \nsaid Anna.",
      "And what s this new building?",
      "That s the house for the doctor and the dispensary,  answered Vronsky,\nseeing the architect in a short jacket coming towards him; and excusing\nhimself to the ladies, he went to meet him.",
      "Going round a hole where the workmen were slaking lime, he stood still\nwith the architect and began talking rather warmly.",
      "The front is still too low,  he said to Anna, who had asked what was\nthe matter.",
      "I said the foundation ought to be raised,  said Anna.",
      "Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna,  said\nthe architect,  but now it s too late.",
      "Yes, I take a great interest in it,  Anna answered Sviazhsky, who was\nexpressing his surprise at her knowledge of architecture.",
      "This new\nbuilding ought to have been in harmony with the hospital.",
      "It was an\nafterthought, and was begun without a plan.",
      "Vronsky, having finished his talk with the architect, joined the\nladies, and led them inside the hospital.",
      "Although they were still at work on the cornices outside and were\npainting on the ground floor, upstairs almost all the rooms were\nfinished.",
      "Going up the broad cast-iron staircase to the landing, they\nwalked into the first large room.",
      "The walls were stuccoed to look like\nmarble, the huge plate-glass windows were already in, only the parquet\nfloor was not yet finished, and the carpenters, who were planing a\nblock of it, left their work, taking off the bands that fastened their\nhair, to greet the gentry.",
      "This is the reception room,  said Vronsky.",
      "Here there will be a desk,\ntables, and benches, and nothing more.",
      "This way; let us go in here.",
      "Don t go near the window,  said Anna,\ntrying the paint to see if it were dry.",
      "Alexey, the paint s dry\nalready,  she added.",
      "From the reception room they went into the corridor.",
      "Here Vronsky\nshowed them the mechanism for ventilation on a novel system.",
      "Then he\nshowed them marble baths, and beds with extraordinary springs.",
      "Then he\nshowed them the wards one after another, the storeroom, the linen room,\nthen the heating stove of a new pattern, then the trolleys, which would\nmake no noise as they carried everything needed along the corridors,\nand many other things.",
      "Sviazhsky, as a connoisseur in the latest\nmechanical improvements, appreciated everything fully.",
      "Dolly simply\nwondered at all she had not seen before, and, anxious to understand it\nall, made minute inquiries about everything, which gave Vronsky great\nsatisfaction.",
      "Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly\nfitted hospital in Russia,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "And won t you have a lying-in ward?",
      "asked Dolly.",
      "That s so much\nneeded in the country.",
      "I have often....",
      "In spite of his usual courtesy, Vronsky interrupted her.",
      "This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is\nintended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,  he said.",
      "Ah!",
      "look at this,  and he rolled up to Darya Alexandrovna an invalid chair\nthat had just been ordered for the convalescents.",
      "Look.",
      "He sat down\nin the chair and began moving it.",
      "The patient can t walk still too\nweak, perhaps, or something wrong with his legs, but he must have air,\nand he moves, rolls himself along.... \n\nDarya Alexandrovna was interested by everything.",
      "She liked everything\nvery much, but most of all she liked Vronsky himself with his natural,\nsimple-hearted eagerness.",
      "Yes, he s a very nice, good man,  she\nthought several times, not hearing what he said, but looking at him and\npenetrating into his expression, while she mentally put herself in\nAnna s place.",
      "She liked him so much just now with his eager interest\nthat she saw how Anna could be in love with him.",
      "Chapter 21\n\n No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don t interest her, \nVronsky said to Anna, who wanted to go on to the stables, where\nSviazhsky wished to see the new stallion.",
      "You go on, while I escort\nthe princess home, and we ll have a little talk,  he said,  if you\nwould like that?",
      "he added, turning to her.",
      "I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,  answered Darya\nAlexandrovna, rather astonished.",
      "She saw by Vronsky s face that he wanted something from her.",
      "She was\nnot mistaken.",
      "As soon as they had passed through the little gate back\ninto the garden, he looked in the direction Anna had taken, and having\nmade sure that she could neither hear nor see them, he began:\n\n You guess that I have something I want to say to you,  he said,\nlooking at her with laughing eyes.",
      "I am not wrong in believing you to\nbe a friend of Anna s.  He took off his hat, and taking out his\nhandkerchief, wiped his head, which was growing bald.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made no answer, and merely stared at him with\ndismay.",
      "When she was left alone with him, she suddenly felt afraid; his\nlaughing eyes and stern expression scared her.",
      "The most diverse suppositions as to what he was about to speak of to\nher flashed into her brain.",
      "He is going to beg me to come to stay with\nthem with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set\nthat will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn t it Vassenka Veslovsky and\nhis relations with Anna?",
      "Or perhaps about Kitty, that he feels he was\nto blame?",
      "All her conjectures were unpleasant, but she did not guess\nwhat he really wanted to talk about to her.",
      "You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you,  he said;\n do help me.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face,\nwhich under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches\nby the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again.",
      "She\nwaited for him to say more, but he walked in silence beside her,\nscratching with his cane in the gravel.",
      "You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna s former\nfriends I don t count Princess Varvara but I know that you have done\nthis not because you regard our position as normal, but because,\nunderstanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her\nand want to be a help to her.",
      "Have I understood you rightly?",
      "he asked,\nlooking round at her.",
      "Oh, yes,  answered Darya Alexandrovna, putting down her sunshade,\n but.... \n\n No,  he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position\ninto which he was putting his companion, he stopped abruptly, so that\nshe had to stop short too.",
      "No one feels more deeply and intensely than\nI do all the difficulty of Anna s position; and that you may well\nunderstand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart.",
      "I am\nto blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.",
      "I understand,  said Darya Alexandrovna, involuntarily admiring the\nsincerity and firmness with which he said this.",
      "But just because you\nfeel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid,  she said.",
      "Her position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.",
      "In the world it is hell!",
      "he brought out quickly, frowning darkly.",
      "You can t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through\nin Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.",
      "Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss society.... \n\n Society!",
      "he said contemptuously,  how could I miss society?",
      "So far and it may be so always you are happy and at peace.",
      "I see in\nAnna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had time to tell me so\nmuch already,  said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling; and involuntarily, as\nshe said this, at the same moment a doubt entered her mind whether Anna\nreally were happy.",
      "But Vronsky, it appeared, had no doubts on that score.",
      "Yes, yes,  he said,  I know that she has revived after all her\nsufferings; she is happy.",
      "She is happy in the present.",
      "But I?...",
      "I am\nafraid of what is before us ...",
      "I beg your pardon, you would like to\nwalk on?",
      "No, I don t mind.",
      "Well, then, let us sit here.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna sat down on a garden seat in a corner of the avenue.",
      "He stood up facing her.",
      "I see that she is happy,  he repeated, and the doubt whether she were\nhappy sank more deeply into Darya Alexandrovna s mind.",
      "But can it\nlast?",
      "Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but\nthe die is cast,  he said, passing from Russian to French,  and we are\nbound together for life.",
      "We are united by all the ties of love that we\nhold most sacred.",
      "We have a child, we may have other children.",
      "But the\nlaw and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of\ncomplications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.",
      "And that one can well understand.",
      "But I can t help seeing them.",
      "My\ndaughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin s. I cannot bear this\nfalsity!",
      "he said, with a vigorous gesture of refusal, and he looked\nwith gloomy inquiry towards Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "She made no answer, but simply gazed at him.",
      "He went on:\n\n One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin;\nhe will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however\nhappy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have,\nthere will be no real tie between us.",
      "They will be Karenins.",
      "You can\nunderstand the bitterness and horror of this position!",
      "I have tried to\nspeak of this to Anna.",
      "It irritates her.",
      "She does not understand, and\nto her I cannot speak plainly of all this.",
      "Now look at another side.",
      "I\nam happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation.",
      "I have found\noccupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than\nthe pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army.",
      "And most\ncertainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs.",
      "I am\nworking here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented,\nand we need nothing more to make us happy.",
      "I love my work here.",
      "_Ce\nn est pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary.... \n\nDarya Alexandrovna noticed that at this point in his explanation he\ngrew confused, and she did not quite understand this digression, but\nshe felt that having once begun to speak of matters near his heart, of\nwhich he could not speak to Anna, he was now making a clean breast of\neverything, and that the question of his pursuits in the country fell\ninto the same category of matters near his heart, as the question of\nhis relations with Anna.",
      "Well, I will go on,  he said, collecting himself.",
      "The great thing is\nthat as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will\nnot die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me, and this I\nhave not.",
      "Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children,\nthe children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to\nsomeone who hates them and cares nothing about them!",
      "It is awful!",
      "He paused, evidently much moved.",
      "Yes, indeed, I see that.",
      "But what can Anna do?",
      "queried Darya\nAlexandrovna.",
      "Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,  he said,\ncalming himself with an effort.",
      "Anna can, it depends on her....",
      "Even\nto petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential.",
      "And\nthat depends on Anna.",
      "Her husband agreed to a divorce at that time your\nhusband had arranged it completely.",
      "And now, I know, he would not\nrefuse it.",
      "It is only a matter of writing to him.",
      "He said plainly at\nthat time that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse.",
      "Of\ncourse,  he said gloomily,  it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of\nwhich only such heartless men are capable.",
      "He knows what agony any\nrecollection of him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a\nletter from her.",
      "I can understand that it is agony to her.",
      "But the\nmatter is of such importance, that one must _passer par-dessus toutes\nces finesses de sentiment.",
      "Il y va du bonheur et de l existence d Anne\net de ses enfants._ I won t speak of myself, though it s hard for me,\nvery hard,  he said, with an expression as though he were threatening\nsomeone for its being hard for him.",
      "And so it is, princess, that I am\nshamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation.",
      "Help me to\npersuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.",
      "Yes, of course,  Darya Alexandrovna said dreamily, as she vividly\nrecalled her last interview with Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Yes, of\ncourse,  she repeated with decision, thinking of Anna.",
      "Use your influence with her, make her write.",
      "I don t like I m almost\nunable to speak about this to her.",
      "Very well, I will talk to her.",
      "But how is it she does not think of it\nherself?",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, and for some reason she suddenly at\nthat point recalled Anna s strange new habit of half-closing her eyes.",
      "And she remembered that Anna drooped her eyelids just when the deeper\nquestions of life were touched upon.",
      "Just as though she half-shut her\neyes to her own life, so as not to see everything,  thought Dolly.",
      "Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her,  Dolly\nsaid in reply to his look of gratitude.",
      "They got up and walked to the house.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nWhen Anna found Dolly at home before her, she looked intently in her\neyes, as though questioning her about the talk she had had with\nVronsky, but she made no inquiry in words.",
      "I believe it s dinner time,  she said.",
      "We ve not seen each other at\nall yet.",
      "I am reckoning on the evening.",
      "Now I want to go and dress.",
      "I\nexpect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.",
      "Dolly went to her room and she felt amused.",
      "To change her dress was\nimpossible, for she had already put on her best dress.",
      "But in order to\nsignify in some way her preparation for dinner, she asked the maid to\nbrush her dress, changed her cuffs and tie, and put some lace on her\nhead.",
      "This is all I can do,  she said with a smile to Anna, who came in to\nher in a third dress, again of extreme simplicity.",
      "Yes, we are too formal here,  she said, as it were apologizing for her\nmagnificence.",
      "Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at\nanything.",
      "He has completely lost his heart to you,  she added.",
      "You re\nnot tired?",
      "There was no time for talking about anything before dinner.",
      "Going into\nthe drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the\ngentlemen of the party in black frock-coats.",
      "The architect wore a\nswallow-tail coat.",
      "Vronsky presented the doctor and the steward to his\nguest.",
      "The architect he had already introduced to her at the hospital.",
      "A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a\nstarched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies\ngot up.",
      "Vronsky asked Sviazhsky to take in Anna Arkadyevna, and himself\noffered his arm to Dolly.",
      "Veslovsky was before Tushkevitch in offering\nhis arm to Princess Varvara, so that Tushkevitch with the steward and\nthe doctor walked in alone.",
      "The dinner, the dining-room, the service, the waiting at table, the\nwine, and the food, were not simply in keeping with the general tone of\nmodern luxury throughout all the house, but seemed even more sumptuous\nand modern.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna watched this luxury which was novel to\nher, and as a good housekeeper used to managing a household although\nshe never dreamed of adapting anything she saw to her own household, as\nit was all in a style of luxury far above her own manner of living she\ncould not help scrutinizing every detail, and wondering how and by whom\nit was all done.",
      "Vassenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviazhsky,\nand many other people she knew, would never have considered this\nquestion, and would have readily believed what every well-bred host\ntries to make his guests feel, that is, that all that is well-ordered\nin his house has cost him, the host, no trouble whatever, but comes of\nitself.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna was well aware that even porridge for the\nchildren s breakfast does not come of itself, and that therefore, where\nso complicated and magnificent a style of luxury was maintained,\nsomeone must give earnest attention to its organization.",
      "And from the\nglance with which Alexey Kirillovitch scanned the table, from the way\nhe nodded to the butler, and offered Darya Alexandrovna her choice\nbetween cold soup and hot soup, she saw that it was all organized and\nmaintained by the care of the master of the house himself.",
      "It was\nevident that it all rested no more upon Anna than upon Veslovsky.",
      "She,\nSviazhsky, the princess, and Veslovsky, were equally guests, with light\nhearts enjoying what had been arranged for them.",
      "Anna was the hostess only in conducting the conversation.",
      "The\nconversation was a difficult one for the lady of the house at a small\ntable with persons present, like the steward and the architect,\nbelonging to a completely different world, struggling not to be\noverawed by an elegance to which they were unaccustomed, and unable to\nsustain a large share in the general conversation.",
      "But this difficult\nconversation Anna directed with her usual tact and naturalness, and\nindeed she did so with actual enjoyment, as Darya Alexandrovna\nobserved.",
      "The conversation began about the row Tushkevitch and\nVeslovsky had taken alone together in the boat, and Tushkevitch began\ndescribing the last boat races in Petersburg at the Yacht Club.",
      "But\nAnna, seizing the first pause, at once turned to the architect to draw\nhim out of his silence.",
      "Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,  she said, meaning Sviazhsky,  at the\nprogress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am\nthere every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.",
      "It s first-rate working with his excellency,  said the architect with\na smile (he was respectful and composed, though with a sense of his own\ndignity).",
      "It s a very different matter to have to do with the district\nauthorities.",
      "Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here\nI call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.",
      "The American way of doing business,  said Sviazhsky, with a smile.",
      "Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....",
      "The conversation passed to the misuse of political power in the United\nStates, but Anna quickly brought it round to another topic, so as to\ndraw the steward into talk.",
      "Have you ever seen a reaping machine?",
      "she said, addressing Darya\nAlexandrovna.",
      "We had just ridden over to look at one when we met.",
      "It s\nthe first time I ever saw one.",
      "How do they work?",
      "asked Dolly.",
      "Exactly like little scissors.",
      "A plank and a lot of little scissors.",
      "Like this.",
      "Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with\nrings, and began showing how the machine worked.",
      "It was clear that she\nsaw nothing would be understood from her explanation; but aware that\nher talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.",
      "More like little penknives,  Veslovsky said playfully, never taking\nhis eyes off her.",
      "Anna gave a just perceptible smile, but made no answer.",
      "Isn t it true,\nKarl Fedoritch, that it s just like little scissors?",
      "she said to the\nsteward.",
      "_Oh, ja,_  answered the German.",
      "_ Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding, _\nand he began to explain the construction of the machine.",
      "It s a pity it doesn t bind too.",
      "I saw one at the Vienna exhibition,\nwhich binds with a wire,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "They would be more\nprofitable in use.",
      "_ Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.",
      "_\nAnd the German, roused from his taciturnity, turned to Vronsky.",
      "_ Das\nl sst sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.",
      "_ The German was just feeling in the\npocket where were his pencil and the notebook he always wrote in, but\nrecollecting that he was at a dinner, and observing Vronsky s chilly\nglance, he checked himself.",
      "_ Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot, _\nhe concluded.",
      "_ W nscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots, _ said Vassenka\nVeslovsky, mimicking the German.",
      "_ J adore l allemand, _ he addressed\nAnna again with the same smile.",
      "_ Cessez, _ she said with playful severity.",
      "We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,  she said\nto the doctor, a sickly-looking man;  have you been there?",
      "I went there, but I had taken flight,  the doctor answered with gloomy\njocoseness.",
      "Then you ve taken a good constitutional?",
      "Splendid!",
      "Well, and how was the old woman?",
      "I hope it s not typhus?",
      "Typhus it is not, but it s taking a bad turn.",
      "What a pity!",
      "said Anna, and having thus paid the dues of civility to\nher domestic circle, she turned to her own friends.",
      "It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your\ndescription, Anna Arkadyevna,  Sviazhsky said jestingly.",
      "Oh, no, why so?",
      "said Anna with a smile that betrayed that she knew\nthere was something charming in her disquisitions upon the machine that\nhad been noticed by Sviazhsky.",
      "This new trait of girlish coquettishness\nmade an unpleasant impression on Dolly.",
      "But Anna Arkadyevna s knowledge of architecture is marvelous,  said\nTushkevitch.",
      "To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths\nand damp-courses,  said Veslovsky.",
      "Have I got it right?",
      "There s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of\nit,  said Anna.",
      "But, I dare say, you don t even know what houses are\nmade of?",
      "Darya Alexandrovna saw that Anna disliked the tone of raillery that\nexisted between her and Veslovsky, but fell in with it against her\nwill.",
      "Vronsky acted in this matter quite differently from Levin.",
      "He obviously\nattached no significance to Veslovsky s chattering; on the contrary, he\nencouraged his jests.",
      "Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?",
      "By cement, of course.",
      "Bravo!",
      "And what is cement?",
      "Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,  said Veslovsky, raising a\ngeneral laugh.",
      "The company at dinner, with the exception of the doctor, the architect,\nand the steward, who remained plunged in gloomy silence, kept up a\nconversation that never paused, glancing off one subject, fastening on\nanother, and at times stinging one or the other to the quick.",
      "Once\nDarya Alexandrovna felt wounded to the quick, and got so hot that she\npositively flushed and wondered afterwards whether she had said\nanything extreme or unpleasant.",
      "Sviazhsky began talking of Levin,\ndescribing his strange view that machinery is simply pernicious in its\neffects on Russian agriculture.",
      "I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,  Vronsky said,\nsmiling,  but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns;\nor if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer\nfashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad.",
      "What sort\nof views can anyone have on such a subject?",
      "Turkish views, in general,  Veslovsky said, turning to Anna with a\nsmile.",
      "I can t defend his opinions,  Darya Alexandrovna said, firing up;  but\nI can say that he s a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he\nwould know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of\ndoing so.",
      "I like him extremely, and we are great friends,  Sviazhsky said,\nsmiling good-naturedly.",
      "_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqu ;_ he\nmaintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards\nare all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.",
      "It s our Russian apathy,  said Vronsky, pouring water from an iced\ndecanter into a delicate glass on a high stem;  we ve no sense of the\nduties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize\nthese duties.",
      "I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,  said\nDarya Alexandrovna, irritated by Vronsky s tone of superiority.",
      "For my part,  pursued Vronsky, who was evidently for some reason or\nother keenly affected by this conversation,  such as I am, I am, on the\ncontrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to\nNikolay Ivanitch  (he indicated Sviazhsky),  in electing me a justice\nof the peace.",
      "I consider that for me the duty of being present at the\nsession, of judging some peasants  quarrel about a horse, is as\nimportant as anything I can do.",
      "And I shall regard it as an honor if\nthey elect me for the district council.",
      "It s only in that way I can pay\nfor the advantages I enjoy as a landowner.",
      "Unluckily they don t\nunderstand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the\nstate.",
      "It was strange to Darya Alexandrovna to hear how serenely confident he\nwas of being right at his own table.",
      "She thought how Levin, who\nbelieved the opposite, was just as positive in his opinions at his own\ntable.",
      "But she loved Levin, and so she was on his side.",
      "So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?",
      "said\nSviazhsky.",
      "But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the\nspot by the eighth.",
      "If you would do me the honor to stop with me.",
      "I rather agree with your _beau-fr re_,  said Anna,  though not quite\non the same ground as he,  she added with a smile.",
      "I m afraid that we\nhave too many of these public duties in these latter days.",
      "Just as in\nold days there were so many government functionaries that one had to\ncall in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone s doing\nsome sort of public duty.",
      "Alexey has been here now six months, and he s\na member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies.",
      "_Du\ntrain que cela va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it.",
      "And I m afraid\nthat with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they ll end in being a\nmere form.",
      "How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?",
      "she turned\nto Sviazhsky over twenty, I fancy.",
      "Anna spoke lightly, but irritation could be discerned in her tone.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, watching Anna and Vronsky attentively, detected it\ninstantly.",
      "She noticed, too, that as she spoke Vronsky s face had\nimmediately taken a serious and obstinate expression.",
      "Noticing this,\nand that Princess Varvara at once made haste to change the conversation\nby talking of Petersburg acquaintances, and remembering what Vronsky\nhad without apparent connection said in the garden of his work in the\ncountry, Dolly surmised that this question of public activity was\nconnected with some deep private disagreement between Anna and Vronsky.",
      "The dinner, the wine, the decoration of the table were all very good;\nbut it was all like what Darya Alexandrovna had seen at formal dinners\nand balls which of late years had become quite unfamiliar to her; it\nall had the same impersonal and constrained character, and so on an\nordinary day and in a little circle of friends it made a disagreeable\nimpression on her.",
      "After dinner they sat on the terrace, then they proceeded to play lawn\ntennis.",
      "The players, divided into two parties, stood on opposite sides\nof a tightly drawn net with gilt poles on the carefully leveled and\nrolled croquet-ground.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made an attempt to play, but\nit was a long time before she could understand the game, and by the\ntime she did understand it, she was so tired that she sat down with\nPrincess Varvara and simply looked on at the players.",
      "Her partner,\nTushkevitch, gave up playing too, but the others kept the game up for a\nlong time.",
      "Sviazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously.",
      "They kept a sharp lookout on the balls served to them, and without\nhaste or getting in each other s way, they ran adroitly up to them,\nwaited for the rebound, and neatly and accurately returned them over\nthe net.",
      "Veslovsky played worse than the others.",
      "He was too eager, but\nhe kept the players lively with his high spirits.",
      "His laughter and\noutcries never paused.",
      "Like the other men of the party, with the\nladies  permission, he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure\nin his white shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his\nimpulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on\nthe memory.",
      "When Darya Alexandrovna lay in bed that night, as soon as she closed\nher eyes, she saw Vassenka Veslovsky flying about the croquet ground.",
      "During the game Darya Alexandrovna was not enjoying herself.",
      "She did\nnot like the light tone of raillery that was kept up all the time\nbetween Vassenka Veslovsky and Anna, and the unnaturalness altogether\nof grown-up people, all alone without children, playing at a child s\ngame.",
      "But to avoid breaking up the party and to get through the time\nsomehow, after a rest she joined the game again, and pretended to be\nenjoying it.",
      "All that day it seemed to her as though she were acting in\na theater with actors cleverer than she, and that her bad acting was\nspoiling the whole performance.",
      "She had come with the intention of\nstaying two days, if all went well.",
      "But in the evening, during the\ngame, she made up her mind that she would go home next day.",
      "The\nmaternal cares and worries, which she had so hated on the way, now,\nafter a day spent without them, struck her in quite another light, and\ntempted her back to them.",
      "When, after evening tea and a row by night in the boat, Darya\nAlexandrovna went alone to her room, took off her dress, and began\narranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.",
      "It was positively disagreeable to her to think that Anna was coming to\nsee her immediately.",
      "She longed to be alone with her own thoughts.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nDolly was wanting to go to bed when Anna came in to see her, attired\nfor the night.",
      "In the course of the day Anna had several times begun to\nspeak of matters near her heart, and every time after a few words she\nhad stopped:  Afterwards, by ourselves, we ll talk about everything.",
      "I ve got so much I want to tell you,  she said.",
      "Now they were by themselves, and Anna did not know what to talk about.",
      "She sat in the window looking at Dolly, and going over in her own mind\nall the stores of intimate talk which had seemed so inexhaustible\nbeforehand, and she found nothing.",
      "At that moment it seemed to her that\neverything had been said already.",
      "Well, what of Kitty?",
      "she said with a heavy sigh, looking penitently\nat Dolly.",
      "Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn t she angry with me?",
      "Angry?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "said Darya Alexandrovna, smiling.",
      "But she hates me, despises me?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "But you know that sort of thing isn t forgiven.",
      "Yes, yes,  said Anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.",
      "But I was not to blame.",
      "And who is to blame?",
      "What s the meaning of\nbeing to blame?",
      "Could it have been otherwise?",
      "What do you think?",
      "Could\nit possibly have happened that you didn t become the wife of Stiva?",
      "Really, I don t know.",
      "But this is what I want you to tell me....",
      "Yes, yes, but we ve not finished about Kitty.",
      "Is she happy?",
      "He s a\nvery nice man, they say.",
      "He s much more than very nice.",
      "I don t know a better man.",
      "Ah, how glad I am!",
      "I m so glad!",
      "Much more than very nice,  she\nrepeated.",
      "Dolly smiled.",
      "But tell me about yourself.",
      "We ve a great deal to talk about.",
      "And I ve\nhad a talk with....  Dolly did not know what to call him.",
      "She felt it\nawkward to call him either the count or Alexey Kirillovitch.",
      "With Alexey,  said Anna,  I know what you talked about.",
      "But I wanted\nto ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?",
      "How am I to say like that straight off?",
      "I really don t know.",
      "No, tell me all the same.... You see my life.",
      "But you mustn t forget\nthat you re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we\nare not alone....",
      "But we came here early in the spring, lived quite\nalone, and shall be alone again, and I desire nothing better.",
      "But\nimagine me living alone without him, alone, and that will be ...",
      "I see\nby everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the\ntime away from home,  she said, getting up and sitting down close by\nDolly.",
      "Of course,  she interrupted Dolly, who would have answered,  of course\nI won t try to keep him by force.",
      "I don t keep him indeed.",
      "The races\nare just coming, his horses are running, he will go.",
      "I m very glad.",
      "But\nthink of me, fancy my position....",
      "But what s the use of talking about\nit?",
      "She smiled.",
      "Well, what did he talk about with you?",
      "He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it s easy for me\nto be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether\nyou could not....  (Darya Alexandrovna hesitated)  correct, improve\nyour position.... You know how I look at it....",
      "But all the same, if\npossible, you should get married.... \n\n Divorce, you mean?",
      "said Anna.",
      "Do you know, the only woman who came\nto see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya?",
      "You know her, of course?",
      "_Au fond, c est la femme la plus deprav e qui existe._ She had an\nintrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest way.",
      "And\nshe told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was\nirregular.",
      "Don t imagine I would compare ...",
      "I know you, darling.",
      "But I\ncould not help remembering.... Well, so what did he say to you?",
      "she\nrepeated.",
      "He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own.",
      "Perhaps you\nwill say that it s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism.",
      "He\nwants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband,\nto have a legal right to you.",
      "What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?",
      "she put in gloomily.",
      "The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer.",
      "That s impossible.",
      "Well?",
      "Well, and the most legitimate desire he wishes that your children\nshould have a name.",
      "What children?",
      "Anna said, not looking at Dolly, and half closing her\neyes.",
      "Annie and those to come....",
      "He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.",
      "How can you tell that you won t?",
      "I shall not, because I don t wish it.",
      "And, in spite of all her\nemotion, Anna smiled, as she caught the na ve expression of curiosity,\nwonder, and horror on Dolly s face.",
      "The doctor told me after my illness....",
      "Impossible!",
      "said Dolly, opening her eyes wide.",
      "For her this was one of those discoveries the consequences and\ndeductions from which are so immense that all that one feels for the\nfirst instant is that it is impossible to take it all in, and that one\nwill have to reflect a great, great deal upon it.",
      "This discovery, suddenly throwing light on all those families of one or\ntwo children, which had hitherto been so incomprehensible to her,\naroused so many ideas, reflections, and contradictory emotions, that\nshe had nothing to say, and simply gazed with wide-open eyes of wonder\nat Anna.",
      "This was the very thing she had been dreaming of, but now\nlearning that it was possible, she was horrified.",
      "She felt that it was\ntoo simple a solution of too complicated a problem.",
      "_ N est-ce pas immoral?",
      "_ was all she said, after a brief pause.",
      "Why so?",
      "Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be\nwith child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my\nhusband practically my husband,  Anna said in a tone intentionally\nsuperficial and frivolous.",
      "Yes, yes,  said Darya Alexandrovna, hearing the very arguments she had\nused to herself, and not finding the same force in them as before.",
      "For you, for other people,  said Anna, as though divining her\nthoughts,  there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You must\nconsider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me.",
      "And\nhow am I to keep his love?",
      "Not like this!",
      "She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with\nextraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas\nand memories rushed into Darya Alexandrovna s head.",
      "I,  she thought,\n did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others, and the\nfirst woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always\npretty and lively.",
      "He deserted her and took another.",
      "And can Anna\nattract and keep Count Vronsky in that way?",
      "If that is what he looks\nfor, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and\ncharming.",
      "And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however\nbeautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he\nwill find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and\ncharming husband does.",
      "Dolly made no answer, she merely sighed.",
      "Anna noticed this sigh,\nindicating dissent, and she went on.",
      "In her armory she had other\narguments so strong that no answer could be made to them.",
      "Do you say that it s not right?",
      "But you must consider,  she went on;\n you forget my position.",
      "How can I desire children?",
      "I m not speaking of\nthe suffering, I m not afraid of that.",
      "Think only, what are my children\nto be?",
      "Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger s name.",
      "For\nthe very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their\nmother, their father, their birth.",
      "But that is just why a divorce is necessary.",
      "But Anna did not hear\nher.",
      "She longed to give utterance to all the arguments with which she\nhad so many times convinced herself.",
      "What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing\nunhappy beings into the world!",
      "She looked at Dolly, but without\nwaiting for a reply she went on:\n\n I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,  she said.",
      "If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are\nunhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.",
      "These were the very arguments Darya Alexandrovna had used in her own\nreflections; but she heard them without understanding them.",
      "How can\none wrong creatures that don t exist?",
      "she thought.",
      "And all at once the\nidea struck her: could it possibly, under any circumstances, have been\nbetter for her favorite Grisha if he had never existed?",
      "And this seemed\nto her so wild, so strange, that she shook her head to drive away this\ntangle of whirling, mad ideas.",
      "No, I don t know; it s not right,  was all she said, with an\nexpression of disgust on her face.",
      "Yes, but you mustn t forget that you and I.... And besides that, \nadded Anna, in spite of the wealth of her arguments and the poverty of\nDolly s objections, seeming still to admit that it was not right,\n don t forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position\nas you.",
      "For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more\nchildren; while for me it is: do I desire to have them?",
      "And that s a\ngreat difference.",
      "You must see that I can t desire it in my position.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna made no reply.",
      "She suddenly felt that she had got\nfar away from Anna; that there lay between them a barrier of questions\non which they could never agree, and about which it was better not to\nspeak.",
      "Chapter 24\n\n Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position,\nif possible,  said Dolly.",
      "Yes, if possible,  said Anna, speaking all at once in an utterly\ndifferent tone, subdued and mournful.",
      "Surely you don t mean a divorce is impossible?",
      "I was told your husband\nhad consented to it.",
      "Dolly, I don t want to talk about that.",
      "Oh, we won t then,  Darya Alexandrovna hastened to say, noticing the\nexpression of suffering on Anna s face.",
      "All I see is that you take too\ngloomy a view of things.",
      "I?",
      "Not at all!",
      "I m always bright and happy.",
      "You see, _je fais des\npassions._ Veslovsky....",
      "Yes, to tell the truth, I don t like Veslovsky s tone,  said Darya\nAlexandrovna, anxious to change the subject.",
      "Oh, that s nonsense!",
      "It amuses Alexey, and that s all; but he s a boy,\nand quite under my control.",
      "You know, I turn him as I please.",
      "It s just\nas it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!",
      "she suddenly changed the\nsubject you say I take too gloomy a view of things.",
      "You can t\nunderstand.",
      "It s too awful!",
      "I try not to take any view of it at all.",
      "But I think you ought to.",
      "You ought to do all you can.",
      "But what can I do?",
      "Nothing.",
      "You tell me to marry Alexey, and say I\ndon t think about it.",
      "I don t think about it!",
      "she repeated, and a\nflush rose into her face.",
      "She got up, straightening her chest, and\nsighed heavily.",
      "With her light step she began pacing up and down the\nroom, stopping now and then.",
      "I don t think of it?",
      "Not a day, not an\nhour passes that I don t think of it, and blame myself for thinking of\nit ... because thinking of that may drive me mad.",
      "Drive me mad!",
      "she\nrepeated.",
      "When I think of it, I can t sleep without morphine.",
      "But\nnever mind.",
      "Let us talk quietly.",
      "They tell me, divorce.",
      "In the first\nplace, he won t give me a divorce.",
      "He s under the influence of Countess\nLidia Ivanovna now.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna, sitting erect on a chair, turned her head,\nfollowing Anna with a face of sympathetic suffering.",
      "You ought to make the attempt,  she said softly.",
      "Suppose I make the attempt.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "she said, evidently\ngiving utterance to a thought, a thousand times thought over and\nlearned by heart.",
      "It means that I, hating him, but still recognizing\nthat I have wronged him and I consider him magnanimous that I humiliate\nmyself to write to him.... Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.",
      "Either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent.... Well, I have\nreceived his consent, say....  Anna was at that moment at the furthest\nend of the room, and she stopped there, doing something to the curtain\nat the window.",
      "I receive his consent, but my ... my son?",
      "They won t\ngive him up to me.",
      "He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom\nI ve abandoned.",
      "Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more\nthan myself two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.",
      "She came out into the middle of the room and stood facing Dolly, with\nher arms pressed tightly across her chest.",
      "In her white dressing gown\nher figure seemed more than usually grand and broad.",
      "She bent her head,\nand with shining, wet eyes looked from under her brows at Dolly, a thin\nlittle pitiful figure in her patched dressing jacket and nightcap,\nshaking all over with emotion.",
      "It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the\nother.",
      "I can t have them together, and that s the only thing I want.",
      "And since I can t have that, I don t care about the rest.",
      "I don t care\nabout anything, anything.",
      "And it will end one way or another, and so I\ncan t, I don t like to talk of it.",
      "So don t blame me, don t judge me\nfor anything.",
      "You can t with your pure heart understand all that I m\nsuffering.",
      "She went up, sat down beside Dolly, and with a guilty look,\npeeped into her face and took her hand.",
      "What are you thinking?",
      "What are you thinking about me?",
      "Don t despise\nme.",
      "I don t deserve contempt.",
      "I m simply unhappy.",
      "If anyone is unhappy,\nI am,  she articulated, and turning away, she burst into tears.",
      "Left alone, Darya Alexandrovna said her prayers and went to bed.",
      "She\nhad felt for Anna with all her heart while she was speaking to her, but\nnow she could not force herself to think of her.",
      "The memories of home\nand of her children rose up in her imagination with a peculiar charm\nquite new to her, with a sort of new brilliance.",
      "That world of her own\nseemed to her now so sweet and precious that she would not on any\naccount spend an extra day outside it, and she made up her mind that\nshe would certainly go back next day.",
      "Anna meantime went back to her boudoir, took a wine-glass and dropped\ninto it several drops of a medicine, of which the principal ingredient\nwas morphine.",
      "After drinking it off and sitting still a little while,\nshe went into her bedroom in a soothed and more cheerful frame of mind.",
      "When she went into the bedroom, Vronsky looked intently at her.",
      "He was\nlooking for traces of the conversation which he knew that, staying so\nlong in Dolly s room, she must have had with her.",
      "But in her expression\nof restrained excitement, and of a sort of reserve, he could find\nnothing but the beauty that always bewitched him afresh though he was\nused to it, the consciousness of it, and the desire that it should\naffect him.",
      "He did not want to ask her what they had been talking of,\nbut he hoped that she would tell him something of her own accord.",
      "But\nshe only said:\n\n I am so glad you like Dolly.",
      "You do, don t you?",
      "Oh, I ve known her a long while, you know.",
      "She s very good-hearted, I\nsuppose, _mais excessivement terre- -terre._ Still, I m very glad to\nsee her.",
      "He took Anna s hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes.",
      "Misinterpreting the look, she smiled to him.",
      "Next morning, in spite of\nthe protests of her hosts, Darya Alexandrovna prepared for her homeward\njourney.",
      "Levin s coachman, in his by no means new coat and shabby hat,\nwith his ill-matched horses and his coach with the patched mud-guards,\ndrove with gloomy determination into the covered gravel approach.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna disliked taking leave of Princess Varvara and the\ngentlemen of the party.",
      "After a day spent together, both she and her\nhosts were distinctly aware that they did not get on together, and that\nit was better for them not to meet.",
      "Only Anna was sad.",
      "She knew that\nnow, from Dolly s departure, no one again would stir up within her soul\nthe feelings that had been roused by their conversation.",
      "It hurt her to\nstir up these feelings, but yet she knew that that was the best part of\nher soul, and that that part of her soul would quickly be smothered in\nthe life she was leading.",
      "As she drove out into the open country, Darya Alexandrovna had a\ndelightful sense of relief, and she felt tempted to ask the two men how\nthey had liked being at Vronsky s, when suddenly the coachman, Philip,\nexpressed himself unasked:\n\n Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they\ngave us.",
      "Everything cleared up till there wasn t a grain left by\ncockcrow.",
      "What are three pots?",
      "A mere mouthful!",
      "And oats now down to\nforty-five kopecks.",
      "At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much\nas they can eat.",
      "The master s a screw,  put in the counting-house clerk.",
      "Well, did you like their horses?",
      "asked Dolly.",
      "The horses!",
      "there s no two opinions about them.",
      "And the food was good.",
      "But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna.",
      "I don t\nknow what you thought,  he said, turning his handsome, good-natured\nface to her.",
      "I thought so too.",
      "Well, shall we get home by evening?",
      "Eh, we must!",
      "On reaching home and finding everyone entirely satisfactory and\nparticularly charming, Darya Alexandrovna began with great liveliness\ntelling them how she had arrived, how warmly they had received her, of\nthe luxury and good taste in which the Vronskys lived, and of their\nrecreations, and she would not allow a word to be said against them.",
      "One has to know Anna and Vronsky I have got to know him better now to\nsee how nice they are, and how touching,  she said, speaking now with\nperfect sincerity, and forgetting the vague feeling of dissatisfaction\nand awkwardness she had experienced there.",
      "Chapter 25\n\nVronsky and Anna spent the whole summer and part of the winter in the\ncountry, living in just the same condition, and still taking no steps\nto obtain a divorce.",
      "It was an understood thing between them that they\nshould not go away anywhere; but both felt, the longer they lived\nalone, especially in the autumn, without guests in the house, that they\ncould not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.",
      "Their life was apparently such that nothing better could be desired.",
      "They had the fullest abundance of everything; they had a child, and\nboth had occupation.",
      "Anna devoted just as much care to her appearance\nwhen they had no visitors, and she did a great deal of reading, both of\nnovels and of what serious literature was in fashion.",
      "She ordered all\nthe books that were praised in the foreign papers and reviews she\nreceived, and read them with that concentrated attention which is only\ngiven to what is read in seclusion.",
      "Moreover, every subject that was of\ninterest to Vronsky, she studied in books and special journals, so that\nhe often went straight to her with questions relating to agriculture or\narchitecture, sometimes even with questions relating to horse-breeding\nor sport.",
      "He was amazed at her knowledge, her memory, and at first was\ndisposed to doubt it, to ask for confirmation of her facts; and she\nwould find what he asked for in some book, and show it to him.",
      "The building of the hospital, too, interested her.",
      "She did not merely\nassist, but planned and suggested a great deal herself.",
      "But her chief\nthought was still of herself how far she was dear to Vronsky, how far\nshe could make up to him for all he had given up.",
      "Vronsky appreciated\nthis desire not only to please, but to serve him, which had become the\nsole aim of her existence, but at the same time he wearied of the\nloving snares in which she tried to hold him fast.",
      "As time went on, and\nhe saw himself more and more often held fast in these snares, he had an\never growing desire, not so much to escape from them, as to try whether\nthey hindered his freedom.",
      "Had it not been for this growing desire to\nbe free, not to have scenes every time he wanted to go to the town to a\nmeeting or a race, Vronsky would have been perfectly satisfied with his\nlife.",
      "The r le he had taken up, the r le of a wealthy landowner, one of\nthat class which ought to be the very heart of the Russian aristocracy,\nwas entirely to his taste; and now, after spending six months in that\ncharacter, he derived even greater satisfaction from it.",
      "And his\nmanagement of his estate, which occupied and absorbed him more and\nmore, was most successful.",
      "In spite of the immense sums cost him by the\nhospital, by machinery, by cows ordered from Switzerland, and many\nother things, he was convinced that he was not wasting, but increasing\nhis substance.",
      "In all matters affecting income, the sales of timber,\nwheat, and wool, the letting of lands, Vronsky was hard as a rock, and\nknew well how to keep up prices.",
      "In all operations on a large scale on\nthis and his other estates, he kept to the simplest methods involving\nno risk, and in trifling details he was careful and exacting to an\nextreme degree.",
      "In spite of all the cunning and ingenuity of the German\nsteward, who would try to tempt him into purchases by making his\noriginal estimate always far larger than really required, and then\nrepresenting to Vronsky that he might get the thing cheaper, and so\nmake a profit, Vronsky did not give in.",
      "He listened to his steward,\ncross-examined him, and only agreed to his suggestions when the\nimplement to be ordered or constructed was the very newest, not yet\nknown in Russia, and likely to excite wonder.",
      "Apart from such\nexceptions, he resolved upon an increased outlay only where there was a\nsurplus, and in making such an outlay he went into the minutest\ndetails, and insisted on getting the very best for his money; so that\nby the method on which he managed his affairs, it was clear that he was\nnot wasting, but increasing his substance.",
      "In October there were the provincial elections in the Kashinsky\nprovince, where were the estates of Vronsky, Sviazhsky, Koznishev,\nOblonsky, and a small part of Levin s land.",
      "These elections were attracting public attention from several\ncircumstances connected with them, and also from the people taking part\nin them.",
      "There had been a great deal of talk about them, and great\npreparations were being made for them.",
      "Persons who never attended the\nelections were coming from Moscow, from Petersburg, and from abroad to\nattend these.",
      "Vronsky had long before promised Sviazhsky to go to them.",
      "Before the elections Sviazhsky, who often visited Vozdvizhenskoe, drove\nover to fetch Vronsky.",
      "On the day before there had been almost a\nquarrel between Vronsky and Anna over this proposed expedition.",
      "It was\nthe very dullest autumn weather, which is so dreary in the country, and\nso, preparing himself for a struggle, Vronsky, with a hard and cold\nexpression, informed Anna of his departure as he had never spoken to\nher before.",
      "But, to his surprise, Anna accepted the information with\ngreat composure, and merely asked when he would be back.",
      "He looked\nintently at her, at a loss to explain this composure.",
      "She smiled at his\nlook.",
      "He knew that way she had of withdrawing into herself, and knew\nthat it only happened when she had determined upon something without\nletting him know her plans.",
      "He was afraid of this; but he was so\nanxious to avoid a scene that he kept up appearances, and half\nsincerely believed in what he longed to believe in her reasonableness.",
      "I hope you won t be dull?",
      "I hope not,  said Anna.",
      "I got a box of books yesterday from\nGautier s. No, I shan t be dull.",
      "She s trying to take that tone, and so much the better,  he thought,\n or else it would be the same thing over and over again.",
      "And he set off for the elections without appealing to her for a candid\nexplanation.",
      "It was the first time since the beginning of their\nintimacy that he had parted from her without a full explanation.",
      "From\none point of view this troubled him, but on the other side he felt that\nit was better so.",
      "At first there will be, as this time, something\nundefined kept back, and then she will get used to it.",
      "In any case I\ncan give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence,  he\nthought.",
      "Chapter 26\n\nIn September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty s confinement.",
      "He had\nspent a whole month in Moscow with nothing to do, when Sergey\nIvanovitch, who had property in the Kashinsky province, and took great\ninterest in the question of the approaching elections, made ready to\nset off to the elections.",
      "He invited his brother, who had a vote in the\nSeleznevsky district, to come with him.",
      "Levin had, moreover, to\ntransact in Kashin some extremely important business relating to the\nwardship of land and to the receiving of certain redemption money for\nhis sister, who was abroad.",
      "Levin still hesitated, but Kitty, who saw that he was bored in Moscow,\nand urged him to go, on her own authority ordered him the proper\nnobleman s uniform, costing seven pounds.",
      "And that seven pounds paid\nfor the uniform was the chief cause that finally decided Levin to go.",
      "He went to Kashin....\n\nLevin had been six days in Kashin, visiting the assembly each day, and\nbusily engaged about his sister s business, which still dragged on.",
      "The\ndistrict marshals of nobility were all occupied with the elections, and\nit was impossible to get the simplest thing done that depended upon the\ncourt of wardship.",
      "The other matter, the payment of the sums due, was\nmet too by difficulties.",
      "After long negotiations over the legal\ndetails, the money was at last ready to be paid; but the notary, a most\nobliging person, could not hand over the order, because it must have\nthe signature of the president, and the president, though he had not\ngiven over his duties to a deputy, was at the elections.",
      "All these\nworrying negotiations, this endless going from place to place, and\ntalking with pleasant and excellent people, who quite saw the\nunpleasantness of the petitioner s position, but were powerless to\nassist him all these efforts that yielded no result, led to a feeling\nof misery in Levin akin to the mortifying helplessness one experiences\nin dreams when one tries to use physical force.",
      "He felt this frequently\nas he talked to his most good-natured solicitor.",
      "This solicitor did, it\nseemed, everything possible, and strained every nerve to get him out of\nhis difficulties.",
      "I tell you what you might try,  he said more than\nonce;  go to so-and-so and so-and-so,  and the solicitor drew up a\nregular plan for getting round the fatal point that hindered\neverything.",
      "But he would add immediately,  It ll mean some delay,\nanyway, but you might try it.",
      "And Levin did try, and did go.",
      "Everyone\nwas kind and civil, but the point evaded seemed to crop up again in the\nend, and again to bar the way.",
      "What was particularly trying, was that\nLevin could not make out with whom he was struggling, to whose interest\nit was that his business should not be done.",
      "That no one seemed to\nknow; the solicitor certainly did not know.",
      "If Levin could have\nunderstood why, just as he saw why one can only approach the booking\noffice of a railway station in single file, it would not have been so\nvexatious and tiresome to him.",
      "But with the hindrances that confronted\nhim in his business, no one could explain why they existed.",
      "But Levin had changed a good deal since his marriage; he was patient,\nand if he could not see why it was all arranged like this, he told\nhimself that he could not judge without knowing all about it, and that\nmost likely it must be so, and he tried not to fret.",
      "In attending the elections, too, and taking part in them, he tried now\nnot to judge, not to fall foul of them, but to comprehend as fully as\nhe could the question which was so earnestly and ardently absorbing\nhonest and excellent men whom he respected.",
      "Since his marriage there\nhad been revealed to Levin so many new and serious aspects of life that\nhad previously, through his frivolous attitude to them, seemed of no\nimportance, that in the question of the elections too he assumed and\ntried to find some serious significance.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch explained to him the meaning and object of the\nproposed revolution at the elections.",
      "The marshal of the province in\nwhose hands the law had placed the control of so many important public\nfunctions the guardianship of wards (the very department which was\ngiving Levin so much trouble just now), the disposal of large sums\nsubscribed by the nobility of the province, the high schools, female,\nmale, and military, and popular instruction on the new model, and\nfinally, the district council the marshal of the province, Snetkov, was\na nobleman of the old school, dissipating an immense fortune, a\ngood-hearted man, honest after his own fashion, but utterly without any\ncomprehension of the needs of modern days.",
      "He always took, in every\nquestion, the side of the nobility; he was positively antagonistic to\nthe spread of popular education, and he succeeded in giving a purely\nparty character to the district council which ought by rights to be of\nsuch an immense importance.",
      "What was needed was to put in his place a\nfresh, capable, perfectly modern man, of contemporary ideas, and to\nframe their policy so as from the rights conferred upon the nobles, not\nas the nobility, but as an element of the district council, to extract\nall the powers of self-government that could possibly be derived from\nthem.",
      "In the wealthy Kashinsky province, which always took the lead of\nother provinces in everything, there was now such a preponderance of\nforces that this policy, once carried through properly there, might\nserve as a model for other provinces for all Russia.",
      "And hence the\nwhole question was of the greatest importance.",
      "It was proposed to elect\nas marshal in place of Snetkov either Sviazhsky, or, better still,\nNevyedovsky, a former university professor, a man of remarkable\nintelligence and a great friend of Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "The meeting was opened by the governor, who made a speech to the\nnobles, urging them to elect the public functionaries, not from regard\nfor persons, but for the service and welfare of their fatherland, and\nhoping that the honorable nobility of the Kashinsky province would, as\nat all former elections, hold their duty as sacred, and vindicate the\nexalted confidence of the monarch.",
      "When he had finished with his speech, the governor walked out of the\nhall, and the noblemen noisily and eagerly some even\nenthusiastically followed him and thronged round him while he put on\nhis fur coat and conversed amicably with the marshal of the province.",
      "Levin, anxious to see into everything and not to miss anything, stood\nthere too in the crowd, and heard the governor say:  Please tell Marya\nIvanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn t come to the Home.",
      "And\nthereupon the nobles in high good-humor sorted out their fur coats and\nall drove off to the cathedral.",
      "In the cathedral Levin, lifting his hand like the rest and repeating\nthe words of the archdeacon, swore with most terrible oaths to do all\nthe governor had hoped they would do.",
      "Church services always affected\nLevin, and as he uttered the words  I kiss the cross,  and glanced\nround at the crowd of young and old men repeating the same, he felt\ntouched.",
      "On the second and third days there was business relating to the\nfinances of the nobility and the female high school, of no importance\nwhatever, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained, and Levin, busy seeing after\nhis own affairs, did not attend the meetings.",
      "On the fourth day the\nauditing of the marshal s accounts took place at the high table of the\nmarshal of the province.",
      "And then there occurred the first skirmish\nbetween the new party and the old.",
      "The committee who had been deputed\nto verify the accounts reported to the meeting that all was in order.",
      "The marshal of the province got up, thanked the nobility for their\nconfidence, and shed tears.",
      "The nobles gave him a loud welcome, and\nshook hands with him.",
      "But at that instant a nobleman of Sergey\nIvanovitch s party said that he had heard that the committee had not\nverified the accounts, considering such a verification an insult to the\nmarshal of the province.",
      "One of the members of the committee\nincautiously admitted this.",
      "Then a small gentleman, very young-looking\nbut very malignant, began to say that it would probably be agreeable to\nthe marshal of the province to give an account of his expenditures of\nthe public moneys, and that the misplaced delicacy of the members of\nthe committee was depriving him of this moral satisfaction.",
      "Then the\nmembers of the committee tried to withdraw their admission, and Sergey\nIvanovitch began to prove that they must logically admit either that\nthey had verified the accounts or that they had not, and he developed\nthis dilemma in detail.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was answered by the spokesman\nof the opposite party.",
      "Then Sviazhsky spoke, and then the malignant\ngentleman again.",
      "The discussion lasted a long time and ended in\nnothing.",
      "Levin was surprised that they should dispute upon this subject\nso long, especially as, when he asked Sergey Ivanovitch whether he\nsupposed that money had been misappropriated, Sergey Ivanovitch\nanswered:\n\n Oh, no!",
      "He s an honest man.",
      "But those old-fashioned methods of\npaternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs\nmust be broken down.",
      "On the fifth day came the elections of the district marshals.",
      "It was\nrather a stormy day in several districts.",
      "In the Seleznevsky district\nSviazhsky was elected unanimously without a ballot, and he gave a\ndinner that evening.",
      "Chapter 27\n\nThe sixth day was fixed for the election of the marshal of the\nprovince.",
      "The rooms, large and small, were full of noblemen in all sorts of\nuniforms.",
      "Many had come only for that day.",
      "Men who had not seen each\nother for years, some from the Crimea, some from Petersburg, some from\nabroad, met in the rooms of the Hall of Nobility.",
      "There was much\ndiscussion around the governor s table under the portrait of the Tsar.",
      "The nobles, both in the larger and the smaller rooms, grouped\nthemselves in camps, and from their hostile and suspicious glances,\nfrom the silence that fell upon them when outsiders approached a group,\nand from the way that some, whispering together, retreated to the\nfarther corridor, it was evident that each side had secrets from the\nother.",
      "In appearance the noblemen were sharply divided into two\nclasses: the old and the new.",
      "The old were for the most part either in\nold uniforms of the nobility, buttoned up closely, with spurs and hats,\nor in their own special naval, cavalry, infantry, or official uniforms.",
      "The uniforms of the older men were embroidered in the old-fashioned way\nwith epaulets on their shoulders; they were unmistakably tight and\nshort in the waist, as though their wearers had grown out of them.",
      "The\nyounger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad\nshoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black\ncollars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace.",
      "To\nthe younger men belonged the court uniforms that here and there\nbrightened up the crowd.",
      "But the division into young and old did not correspond with the\ndivision of parties.",
      "Some of the young men, as Levin observed, belonged\nto the old party; and some of the very oldest noblemen, on the\ncontrary, were whispering with Sviazhsky, and were evidently ardent\npartisans of the new party.",
      "Levin stood in the smaller room, where they were smoking and taking\nlight refreshments, close to his own friends, and listening to what\nthey were saying, he conscientiously exerted all his intelligence\ntrying to understand what was said.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was the center\nround which the others grouped themselves.",
      "He was listening at that\nmoment to Sviazhsky and Hliustov, the marshal of another district, who\nbelonged to their party.",
      "Hliustov would not agree to go with his\ndistrict to ask Snetkov to stand, while Sviazhsky was persuading him to\ndo so, and Sergey Ivanovitch was approving of the plan.",
      "Levin could not\nmake out why the opposition was to ask the marshal to stand whom they\nwanted to supersede.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had just been drinking and taking some lunch,\ncame up to them in his uniform of a gentleman of the bedchamber, wiping\nhis lips with a perfumed handkerchief of bordered batiste.",
      "We are placing our forces,  he said, pulling out his whiskers,  Sergey\nIvanovitch!",
      "And listening to the conversation, he supported Sviazhsky s contention.",
      "One district s enough, and Sviazhsky s obviously of the opposition, \nhe said, words evidently intelligible to all except Levin.",
      "Why, Kostya, you here too!",
      "I suppose you re converted, eh?",
      "he added,\nturning to Levin and drawing his arm through his.",
      "Levin would have been\nglad indeed to be converted, but could not make out what the point was,\nand retreating a few steps from the speakers, he explained to Stepan\nArkadyevitch his inability to understand why the marshal of the\nprovince should be asked to stand.",
      "_ O sancta simplicitas!",
      "_ said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and briefly and\nclearly he explained it to Levin.",
      "If, as at previous elections, all the\ndistricts asked the marshal of the province to stand, then he would be\nelected without a ballot.",
      "That must not be.",
      "Now eight districts had\nagreed to call upon him: if two refused to do so, Snetkov might decline\nto stand at all; and then the old party might choose another of their\nparty, which would throw them completely out in their reckoning.",
      "But if\nonly one district, Sviazhsky s, did not call upon him to stand, Snetkov\nwould let himself be balloted for.",
      "They were even, some of them, going\nto vote for him, and purposely to let him get a good many votes, so\nthat the enemy might be thrown off the scent, and when a candidate of\nthe other side was put up, they too might give him some votes.",
      "Levin\nunderstood to some extent, but not fully, and would have put a few more\nquestions, when suddenly everyone began talking and making a noise and\nthey moved towards the big room.",
      "What is it?",
      "eh?",
      "whom?",
      "No guarantee?",
      "whose?",
      "what?",
      "They won t pass\nhim?",
      "No guarantee?",
      "They won t let Flerov in?",
      "Eh, because of the\ncharge against him?",
      "Why, at this rate, they won t admit anyone.",
      "It s\na swindle!",
      "The law!",
      "Levin heard exclamations on all sides, and he\nmoved into the big room together with the others, all hurrying\nsomewhere and afraid of missing something.",
      "Squeezed by the crowding\nnoblemen, he drew near the high table where the marshal of the\nprovince, Sviazhsky, and the other leaders were hotly disputing about\nsomething.",
      "Chapter 28\n\nLevin was standing rather far off.",
      "A nobleman breathing heavily and\nhoarsely at his side, and another whose thick boots were creaking,\nprevented him from hearing distinctly.",
      "He could only hear the soft\nvoice of the marshal faintly, then the shrill voice of the malignant\ngentleman, and then the voice of Sviazhsky.",
      "They were disputing, as far\nas he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and\nthe exact meaning of the words:  liable to be called up for trial.",
      "The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the\ntable.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had\nfinished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to\nrefer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.",
      "The\nact said that in case of difference of opinion, there must be a ballot.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at\nthat point a tall, stout, round-shouldered landowner, with dyed\nwhiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted\nhim.",
      "He went up to the table, and striking it with his finger ring, he\nshouted loudly:  A ballot!",
      "Put it to the vote!",
      "No need for more\ntalking!",
      "Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall\nnobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more\nand more loudly.",
      "But it was impossible to make out what he said.",
      "He was shouting for the very course Sergey Ivanovitch had proposed; but\nit was evident that he hated him and all his party, and this feeling of\nhatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it\nthe same vindictiveness, though in a more seemly form, on the other\nside.",
      "Shouts were raised, and for a moment all was confusion, so that\nthe marshal of the province had to call for order.",
      "A ballot!",
      "A ballot!",
      "Every nobleman sees it!",
      "We shed our blood for our\ncountry!...",
      "The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the accounts\nof the marshal; he s not a cashier....",
      "But that s not the point....",
      "Votes, please!",
      "Beastly!...",
      "shouted furious and violent voices on all\nsides.",
      "Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their\nwords.",
      "They expressed the most implacable hatred.",
      "Levin did not in the\nleast understand what was the matter, and he marveled at the passion\nwith which it was disputed whether or not the decision about Flerov\nshould be put to the vote.",
      "He forgot, as Sergey Ivanovitch explained to\nhim afterwards, this syllogism: that it was necessary for the public\ngood to get rid of the marshal of the province; that to get rid of the\nmarshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes; that to get a\nmajority of votes it was necessary to secure Flerov s right to vote;\nthat to secure the recognition of Flerov s right to vote they must\ndecide on the interpretation to be put on the act.",
      "And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious\nand consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,  concluded\nSergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him\nto see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such\nan unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.",
      "To escape from this\npainful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody\nexcept the waiters at the refreshment bar.",
      "Seeing the waiters busy over\nwashing up the crockery and setting in order their plates and\nwine-glasses, seeing their calm and cheerful faces, Levin felt an\nunexpected sense of relief as though he had come out of a stuffy room\ninto the fresh air.",
      "He began walking up and down, looking with pleasure\nat the waiters.",
      "He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered\nwaiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered\nat by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly.",
      "Levin\nwas just about to enter into conversation with the old waiter, when the\nsecretary of the court of wardship, a little old man whose specialty it\nwas to know all the noblemen of the province by name and patronymic,\ndrew him away.",
      "Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,  he said,  your brother s\nlooking for you.",
      "They are voting on the legal point.",
      "Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his\nbrother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing\nwith a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and\nsniffing at it.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the\nball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.",
      "Levin advanced, but\nutterly forgetting what he was to do, and much embarrassed, he turned\nto Sergey Ivanovitch with the question,  Where am I to put it?",
      "He\nasked this softly, at a moment when there was talking going on near, so\nthat he had hoped his question would not be overheard.",
      "But the persons\nspeaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.",
      "Sergey\nIvanovitch frowned.",
      "That is a matter for each man s own decision,  he said severely.",
      "Several people smiled.",
      "Levin crimsoned, hurriedly thrust his hand under\nthe cloth, and put the ball to the right as it was in his right hand.",
      "Having put it in, he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left\nhand too, and so he thrust it in though too late, and, still more\novercome with confusion, he beat a hasty retreat into the background.",
      "A hundred and twenty-six for admission!",
      "Ninety-eight against!",
      "sang\nout the voice of the secretary, who could not pronounce the letter _r_.",
      "Then there was a laugh; a button and two nuts were found in the box.",
      "The nobleman was allowed the right to vote, and the new party had\nconquered.",
      "But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.",
      "Levin heard\nthat they were asking Snetkov to stand, and he saw that a crowd of\nnoblemen was surrounding the marshal, who was saying something.",
      "Levin\nwent nearer.",
      "In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the\nprovince had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he\ndid not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the\nnobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.",
      "Several times\nhe repeated the words:  I have served to the best of my powers with\ntruth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,  and\nsuddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out\nof the room.",
      "Whether these tears came from a sense of the injustice\nbeing done him, from his love for the nobility, or from the strain of\nthe position he was placed in, feeling himself surrounded by enemies,\nhis emotion infected the assembly, the majority were touched, and Levin\nfelt a tenderness for Snetkov.",
      "In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.",
      "Beg pardon, excuse me, please,  he said as to a stranger, but\nrecognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.",
      "It seemed to Levin that he would\nhave liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.",
      "His face\nand his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white\ntrousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded\nLevin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.",
      "This\nexpression in the marshal s face was particularly touching to Levin,\nbecause, only the day before, he had been at his house about his\ntrustee business and had seen him in all his grandeur, a kind-hearted,\nfatherly man.",
      "The big house with the old family furniture; the rather\ndirty, far from stylish, but respectful footmen, unmistakably old house\nserfs who had stuck to their master; the stout, good-natured wife in a\ncap with lace and a Turkish shawl, petting her pretty grandchild, her\ndaughter s daughter; the young son, a sixth form high school boy,\ncoming home from school, and greeting his father, kissing his big hand;\nthe genuine, cordial words and gestures of the old man all this had the\nday before roused an instinctive feeling of respect and sympathy in\nLevin.",
      "This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now,\nand he longed to say something pleasant to him.",
      "So you re sure to be our marshal again,  he said.",
      "It s not likely,  said the marshal, looking round with a scared\nexpression.",
      "I m worn out, I m old.",
      "If there are men younger and more\ndeserving than I, let them serve.",
      "And the marshal disappeared through a side door.",
      "The most solemn moment was at hand.",
      "They were to proceed immediately to\nthe election.",
      "The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and\nblack on their fingers.",
      "The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov s\nvote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to\nfetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the\nelections by the wiles of the other party.",
      "Two noble gentlemen, who had\na weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of\nSnetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.",
      "On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute\nabout Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the\nstripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the\nmeeting.",
      "I ve brought one, drenched him with water,  said the landowner, who\nhad gone on this errand, to Sviazhsky.",
      "He s all right?",
      "he ll do.",
      "Not too drunk, he won t fall down?",
      "said Sviazhsky, shaking his head.",
      "No, he s first-rate.",
      "If only they don t give him any more here....",
      "I ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account.",
      "Chapter 29\n\nThe narrow room, in which they were smoking and taking refreshments,\nwas full of noblemen.",
      "The excitement grew more intense, and every face\nbetrayed some uneasiness.",
      "The excitement was specially keen for the\nleaders of each party, who knew every detail, and had reckoned up every\nvote.",
      "They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.",
      "The\nrest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were\ngetting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the\ninterval.",
      "Some were lunching, standing at the bar, or sitting at the\ntable; others were walking up and down the long room, smoking\ncigarettes, and talking with friends whom they had not seen for a long\nwhile.",
      "Levin did not care to eat, and he was not smoking; he did not want to\njoin his own friends, that is Sergey Ivanovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nSviazhsky and the rest, because Vronsky in his equerry s uniform was\nstanding with them in eager conversation.",
      "Levin had seen him already at\nthe meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not\ncaring to greet him.",
      "He went to the window and sat down, scanning the\ngroups, and listening to what was being said around him.",
      "He felt\ndepressed, especially because everyone else was, as he saw, eager,\nanxious, and interested, and he alone, with an old, toothless little\nman with mumbling lips wearing a naval uniform, sitting beside him, had\nno interest in it and nothing to do.",
      "He s such a blackguard!",
      "I have told him so, but it makes no\ndifference.",
      "Only think of it!",
      "He couldn t collect it in three years!",
      "he heard vigorously uttered by a round-shouldered, short, country\ngentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and\nnew boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped\nenergetically as he spoke.",
      "Casting a displeased glance at Levin, this\ngentleman sharply turned his back.",
      "Yes, it s a dirty business, there s no denying,  a small gentleman\nassented in a high voice.",
      "Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general,\nhurriedly came near Levin.",
      "These persons were unmistakably seeking a\nplace where they could talk without being overheard.",
      "How dare he say I had his breeches stolen!",
      "Pawned them for drink, I\nexpect.",
      "Damn the fellow, prince indeed!",
      "He d better not say it, the\nbeast!",
      "But excuse me!",
      "They take their stand on the act,  was being said in\nanother group;  the wife must be registered as noble.",
      "Oh, damn your acts!",
      "I speak from my heart.",
      "We re all gentlemen, aren t\nwe?",
      "Above suspicion.",
      "Shall we go on, your excellency, _fine champagne?_ \n\nAnother group was following a nobleman, who was shouting something in a\nloud voice; it was one of the three intoxicated gentlemen.",
      "I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can\nnever save a profit,  he heard a pleasant voice say.",
      "The speaker was a\ncountry gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of\nan old general staff-officer.",
      "It was the very landowner Levin had met\nat Sviazhsky s. He knew him at once.",
      "The landowner too stared at Levin,\nand they exchanged greetings.",
      "Very glad to see you!",
      "To be sure!",
      "I remember you very well.",
      "Last year\nat our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch s. \n\n Well, and how is your land doing?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,  the landowner answered\nwith a resigned smile, but with an expression of serenity and\nconviction that so it must be.",
      "And how do you come to be in our\nprovince?",
      "he asked.",
      "Come to take part in our _coup d tat?_  he said,\nconfidently pronouncing the French words with a bad accent.",
      "All\nRussia s here gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the\nministry.",
      "He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in\nwhite trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a general.",
      "I ought to own that I don t very well understand the drift of the\nprovincial elections,  said Levin.",
      "The landowner looked at him.",
      "Why, what is there to understand?",
      "There s no meaning in it at all.",
      "It s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of\ninertia.",
      "Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it s an assembly of\njustices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but\nnot of noblemen.",
      "Then why do you come?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "From habit, nothing else.",
      "Then, too, one must keep up connections.",
      "It s a moral obligation of a sort.",
      "And then, to tell the truth, there s\none s own interests.",
      "My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent\nmember; they re not rich people, and he must be brought forward.",
      "These\ngentlemen, now, what do they come for?",
      "he said, pointing to the\nmalignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.",
      "That s the new generation of nobility.",
      "New it may be, but nobility it isn t. They re proprietors of a sort,\nbut we re the landowners.",
      "As noblemen, they re cutting their own\nthroats.",
      "But you say it s an institution that s served its time.",
      "That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more\nrespectfully.",
      "Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but\nwe re the growth of a thousand years.",
      "If we re laying out a garden,\nplanning one before the house, you know, and there you ve a tree that s\nstood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and\nyet you don t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds,\nbut lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree.",
      "You won t\ngrow him again in a year,  he said cautiously, and he immediately\nchanged the conversation.",
      "Well, and how is your land doing?",
      "Oh, not very well.",
      "I make five per cent.",
      "Yes, but you don t reckon your own work.",
      "Aren t you worth something\ntoo?",
      "I ll tell you my own case.",
      "Before I took to seeing after the land,\nI had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service.",
      "Now I do more\nwork than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent.",
      "on\nthe land, and thank God for that.",
      "But one s work is thrown in for\nnothing.",
      "Then why do you do it, if it s a clear loss?",
      "Oh, well, one does it!",
      "What would you have?",
      "It s habit, and one knows\nit s how it should be.",
      "And what s more,  the landowner went on, leaning\nhis elbows on the window and chatting on,  my son, I must tell you, has\nno taste for it.",
      "There s no doubt he ll be a scientific man.",
      "So\nthere ll be no one to keep it up.",
      "And yet one does it.",
      "Here this year\nI ve planted an orchard.",
      "Yes, yes,  said Levin,  that s perfectly true.",
      "I always feel there s\nno real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....",
      "It s a sort of duty one feels to the land.",
      "But I tell you what,  the landowner pursued;  a neighbor of mine, a\nmerchant, was at my place.",
      "We walked about the fields and the garden.",
      "No,  said he,  Stepan Vassilievitch, everything s well looked after,\nbut your garden s neglected.",
      "But, as a fact, it s well kept up.",
      "To my\nthinking, I d cut down that lime-tree.",
      "Here you ve thousands of limes,\nand each would make two good bundles of bark.",
      "And nowadays that bark s\nworth something.",
      "I d cut down the lot.",
      "And with what he made he d increase his stock, or buy some land for a\ntrifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,  Levin added, smiling.",
      "He had evidently more than once come across those commercial\ncalculations.",
      "And he d make his fortune.",
      "But you and I must thank God\nif we keep what we ve got and leave it to our children.",
      "You re married, I ve heard?",
      "said the landowner.",
      "Yes,  Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.",
      "Yes, it s rather\nstrange,  he went on.",
      "So we live without making anything, as though we\nwere ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.",
      "The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.",
      "There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or\nCount Vronsky, that s settled here lately, who try to carry on their\nhusbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing\nbut making away with capital on it.",
      "But why is it we don t do like the merchants?",
      "Why don t we cut down\nour parks for timber?",
      "said Levin, returning to a thought that had\nstruck him.",
      "Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.",
      "Besides that s not work for a\nnobleman.",
      "And our work as noblemen isn t done here at the elections,\nbut yonder, each in our corner.",
      "There s a class instinct, too, of what\none ought and oughtn t to do.",
      "There s the peasants, too, I wonder at\nthem sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.",
      "However bad the land is, he ll work it.",
      "Without a return too.",
      "At a\nsimple loss.",
      "Just as we do,  said Levin.",
      "Very, very glad to have met you,  he\nadded, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.",
      "And here we ve met for the first time since we met at your place, \nsaid the landowner to Sviazhsky,  and we ve had a good talk too.",
      "Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?",
      "said Sviazhsky\nwith a smile.",
      "That we re bound to do.",
      "You ve relieved your feelings?",
      "Chapter 30\n\nSviazhsky took Levin s arm, and went with him to his own friends.",
      "This time there was no avoiding Vronsky.",
      "He was standing with Stepan\nArkadyevitch and Sergey Ivanovitch, and looking straight at Levin as he\ndrew near.",
      "Delighted!",
      "I believe I ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at\nPrincess Shtcherbatskaya s,  he said, giving Levin his hand.",
      "Yes, I quite remember our meeting,  said Levin, and blushing crimson,\nhe turned away immediately, and began talking to his brother.",
      "With a slight smile Vronsky went on talking to Sviazhsky, obviously\nwithout the slightest inclination to enter into conversation with\nLevin.",
      "But Levin, as he talked to his brother, was continually looking\nround at Vronsky, trying to think of something to say to him to gloss\nover his rudeness.",
      "What are we waiting for now?",
      "asked Levin, looking at Sviazhsky and\nVronsky.",
      "For Snetkov.",
      "He has to refuse or to consent to stand,  answered\nSviazhsky.",
      "Well, and what has he done, consented or not?",
      "That s the point, that he s done neither,  said Vronsky.",
      "And if he refuses, who will stand then?",
      "asked Levin, looking at\nVronsky.",
      "Whoever chooses to,  said Sviazhsky.",
      "Shall you?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Certainly not I,  said Sviazhsky, looking confused, and turning an\nalarmed glance at the malignant gentleman, who was standing beside\nSergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Who then?",
      "Nevyedovsky?",
      "said Levin, feeling he was putting his foot\ninto it.",
      "But this was worse still.",
      "Nevyedovsky and Sviazhsky were the two\ncandidates.",
      "I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,  answered the\nmalignant gentleman.",
      "This was Nevyedovsky himself.",
      "Sviazhsky introduced him to Levin.",
      "Well, you find it exciting too?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, winking at\nVronsky.",
      "It s something like a race.",
      "One might bet on it.",
      "Yes, it is keenly exciting,  said Vronsky.",
      "And once taking the thing\nup, one s eager to see it through.",
      "It s a fight!",
      "he said, scowling and\nsetting his powerful jaws.",
      "What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is!",
      "Sees it all so clearly.",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "Vronsky assented indifferently.",
      "A silence followed, during which Vronsky since he had to look at\nsomething looked at Levin, at his feet, at his uniform, then at his\nface, and noticing his gloomy eyes fixed upon him, he said, in order to\nsay something:\n\n How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a\njustice of the peace?",
      "You are not in the uniform of one.",
      "It s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly\ninstitution,  Levin answered gloomily.",
      "He had been all the time looking\nfor an opportunity to enter into conversation with Vronsky, so as to\nsmooth over his rudeness at their first meeting.",
      "I don t think so, quite the contrary,  Vronsky said, with quiet\nsurprise.",
      "It s a plaything,  Levin cut him short.",
      "We don t want justices of the\npeace.",
      "I ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight\nyears.",
      "And what I have had was decided wrongly by them.",
      "The justice of\nthe peace is over thirty miles from me.",
      "For some matter of two roubles\nI should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.",
      "And he related how a peasant had stolen some flour from the miller, and\nwhen the miller told him of it, had lodged a complaint for slander.",
      "All\nthis was utterly uncalled for and stupid, and Levin felt it himself as\nhe said it.",
      "Oh, this is such an original fellow!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch with\nhis most soothing, almond-oil smile.",
      "But come along; I think they re\nvoting.... \n\nAnd they separated.",
      "I can t understand,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, who had observed his\nbrother s clumsiness,  I can t understand how anyone can be so\nabsolutely devoid of political tact.",
      "That s where we Russians are so\ndeficient.",
      "The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him\nyou re _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand.",
      "Count Vronsky, now ...",
      "I m not making a friend of him; he s asked me to dinner, and I m not\ngoing; but he s one of our side why make an enemy of him?",
      "Then you ask\nNevyedovsky if he s going to stand.",
      "That s not a thing to do.",
      "Oh, I don t understand it at all!",
      "And it s all such nonsense,  Levin\nanswered gloomily.",
      "You say it s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do\nwith it, you make a muddle.",
      "Levin did not answer, and they walked together into the big room.",
      "The marshal of the province, though he was vaguely conscious in the air\nof some trap being prepared for him, and though he had not been called\nupon by all to stand, had still made up his mind to stand.",
      "All was\nsilence in the room.",
      "The secretary announced in a loud voice that the\ncaptain of the guards, Mihail Stepanovitch Snetkov, would now be\nballoted for as marshal of the province.",
      "The district marshals walked carrying plates, on which were balls, from\ntheir tables to the high table, and the election began.",
      "Put it in the right side,  whispered Stepan Arkadyevitch, as with his\nbrother Levin followed the marshal of his district to the table.",
      "But\nLevin had forgotten by now the calculations that had been explained to\nhim, and was afraid Stepan Arkadyevitch might be mistaken in saying\n the right side.",
      "Surely Snetkov was the enemy.",
      "As he went up, he held\nthe ball in his right hand, but thinking he was wrong, just at the box\nhe changed to the left hand, and undoubtedly put the ball to the left.",
      "An adept in the business, standing at the box and seeing by the mere\naction of the elbow where each put his ball, scowled with annoyance.",
      "It\nwas no good for him to use his insight.",
      "Everything was still, and the counting of the balls was heard.",
      "Then a\nsingle voice rose and proclaimed the numbers for and against.",
      "The\nmarshal had been voted for by a considerable majority.",
      "All was noise\nand eager movement towards the doors.",
      "Snetkov came in, and the nobles\nthronged round him, congratulating him.",
      "Well, now is it over?",
      "Levin asked Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "It s only just beginning,  Sviazhsky said, replying for Sergey\nIvanovitch with a smile.",
      "Some other candidate may receive more votes\nthan the marshal.",
      "Levin had quite forgotten about that.",
      "Now he could only remember that\nthere was some sort of trickery in it, but he was too bored to think\nwhat it was exactly.",
      "He felt depressed, and longed to get out of the\ncrowd.",
      "As no one was paying any attention to him, and no one apparently needed\nhim, he quietly slipped away into the little room where the\nrefreshments were, and again had a great sense of comfort when he saw\nthe waiters.",
      "The little old waiter pressed him to have something, and\nLevin agreed.",
      "After eating a cutlet with beans and talking to the\nwaiters of their former masters, Levin, not wishing to go back to the\nhall, where it was all so distasteful to him, proceeded to walk through\nthe galleries.",
      "The galleries were full of fashionably dressed ladies,\nleaning over the balustrade and trying not to lose a single word of\nwhat was being said below.",
      "With the ladies were sitting and standing\nsmart lawyers, high school teachers in spectacles, and officers.",
      "Everywhere they were talking of the election, and of how worried the\nmarshal was, and how splendid the discussions had been.",
      "In one group\nLevin heard his brother s praises.",
      "One lady was telling a lawyer:\n\n How glad I am I heard Koznishev!",
      "It s worth losing one s dinner.",
      "He s\nexquisite!",
      "So clear and distinct all of it!",
      "There s not one of you in\nthe law courts that speaks like that.",
      "The only one is Meidel, and he s\nnot so eloquent by a long way.",
      "Finding a free place, Levin leaned over the balustrade and began\nlooking and listening.",
      "All the noblemen were sitting railed off behind barriers according to\ntheir districts.",
      "In the middle of the room stood a man in a uniform,\nwho shouted in a loud, high voice:\n\n As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we\ncall upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!",
      "A dead silence\nfollowed, and then a weak old voice was heard:  Declined!",
      "We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,  the voice\nbegan again.",
      "Declined!",
      "a high boyish voice replied.",
      "Again it began, and again  Declined.",
      "And so it went on for about an\nhour.",
      "Levin, with his elbows on the balustrade, looked and listened.",
      "At\nfirst he wondered and wanted to know what it meant; then feeling sure\nthat he could not make it out he began to be bored.",
      "Then recalling all\nthe excitement and vindictiveness he had seen on all the faces, he felt\nsad; he made up his mind to go, and went downstairs.",
      "As he passed\nthrough the entry to the galleries he met a dejected high school boy\nwalking up and down with tired-looking eyes.",
      "On the stairs he met a\ncouple a lady running quickly on her high heels and the jaunty deputy\nprosecutor.",
      "I told you you weren t late,  the deputy prosecutor was saying at the\nmoment when Levin moved aside to let the lady pass.",
      "Levin was on the stairs to the way out, and was just feeling in his\nwaistcoat pocket for the number of his overcoat, when the secretary\novertook him.",
      "This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.",
      "The candidate who was being voted on was Nevyedovsky, who had so\nstoutly denied all idea of standing.",
      "Levin went up to the door of the\nroom; it was locked.",
      "The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin\nwas met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out.",
      "I can t stand any more of it,  said one red-faced gentleman.",
      "After them the face of the marshal of the province was poked out.",
      "His\nface was dreadful-looking from exhaustion and dismay.",
      "I told you not to let anyone out!",
      "he cried to the doorkeeper.",
      "I let someone in, your excellency!",
      "Mercy on us!",
      "and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked\nwith downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his\nlegs staggering in his white trousers.",
      "Nevyedovsky had scored a higher majority, as they had planned, and he\nwas the new marshal of the province.",
      "Many people were amused, many were\npleased and happy, many were in ecstasies, many were disgusted and\nunhappy.",
      "The former marshal of the province was in a state of despair,\nwhich he could not conceal.",
      "When Nevyedovsky went out of the room, the\ncrowd thronged round him and followed him enthusiastically, just as\nthey had followed the governor who had opened the meetings, and just as\nthey had followed Snetkov when he was elected.",
      "Chapter 31\n\nThe newly elected marshal and many of the successful party dined that\nday with Vronsky.",
      "Vronsky had come to the elections partly because he was bored in the\ncountry and wanted to show Anna his right to independence, and also to\nrepay Sviazhsky by his support at the election for all the trouble he\nhad taken for Vronsky at the district council election, but chiefly in\norder strictly to perform all those duties of a nobleman and landowner\nwhich he had taken upon himself.",
      "But he had not in the least expected\nthat the election would so interest him, so keenly excite him, and that\nhe would be so good at this kind of thing.",
      "He was quite a new man in\nthe circle of the nobility of the province, but his success was\nunmistakable, and he was not wrong in supposing that he had already\nobtained a certain influence.",
      "This influence was due to his wealth and\nreputation, the capital house in the town lent him by his old friend\nShirkov, who had a post in the department of finances and was director\nof a flourishing bank in Kashin; the excellent cook Vronsky had brought\nfrom the country, and his friendship with the governor, who was a\nschoolfellow of Vronsky s a schoolfellow he had patronized and\nprotected indeed.",
      "But what contributed more than all to his success was\nhis direct, equable manner with everyone, which very quickly made the\nmajority of the noblemen reverse the current opinion of his supposed\nhaughtiness.",
      "He was himself conscious that, except that whimsical\ngentleman married to Kitty Shtcherbatskaya, who had _  propos de\nbottes_ poured out a stream of irrelevant absurdities with such\nspiteful fury, every nobleman with whom he had made acquaintance had\nbecome his adherent.",
      "He saw clearly, and other people recognized it,\ntoo, that he had done a great deal to secure the success of\nNevyedovsky.",
      "And now at his own table, celebrating Nevyedovsky s\nelection, he was experiencing an agreeable sense of triumph over the\nsuccess of his candidate.",
      "The election itself had so fascinated him\nthat, if he could succeed in getting married during the next three\nyears, he began to think of standing himself much as after winning a\nrace ridden by a jockey, he had longed to ride a race himself.",
      "Today he was celebrating the success of his jockey.",
      "Vronsky sat at the\nhead of the table, on his right hand sat the young governor, a general\nof high rank.",
      "To all the rest he was the chief man in the province, who\nhad solemnly opened the elections with his speech, and aroused a\nfeeling of respect and even of awe in many people, as Vronsky saw; to\nVronsky he was little Katka Maslov that had been his nickname in the\nPages  Corps whom he felt to be shy and tried to _mettre   son aise_.",
      "On the left hand sat Nevyedovsky with his youthful, stubborn, and\nmalignant face.",
      "With him Vronsky was simple and deferential.",
      "Sviazhsky took his failure very light-heartedly.",
      "It was indeed no\nfailure in his eyes, as he said himself, turning, glass in hand, to\nNevyedovsky; they could not have found a better representative of the\nnew movement, which the nobility ought to follow.",
      "And so every honest\nperson, as he said, was on the side of today s success and was\nrejoicing over it.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was glad, too, that he was having a good time, and\nthat everyone was pleased.",
      "The episode of the elections served as a\ngood occasion for a capital dinner.",
      "Sviazhsky comically imitated the\ntearful discourse of the marshal, and observed, addressing Nevyedovsky,\nthat his excellency would have to select another more complicated\nmethod of auditing the accounts than tears.",
      "Another nobleman jocosely\ndescribed how footmen in stockings had been ordered for the marshal s\nball, and how now they would have to be sent back unless the new\nmarshal would give a ball with footmen in stockings.",
      "Continually during dinner they said of Nevyedovsky:  our marshal,  and\n your excellency.",
      "This was said with the same pleasure with which a bride is called\n Madame  and her husband s name.",
      "Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely\nindifferent but scornful of this appellation, but it was obvious that\nhe was highly delighted, and had to keep a curb on himself not to\nbetray the triumph which was unsuitable to their new liberal tone.",
      "After dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the\nresult of the election.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was in high good\nhumor, sent Darya Alexandrovna a telegram:  Nevyedovsky elected by\ntwenty votes.",
      "Congratulations.",
      "Tell people.",
      "He dictated it aloud,\nsaying:  We must let them share our rejoicing.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna,\ngetting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and\nunderstood that it was an after-dinner affair.",
      "She knew Stiva had a\nweakness after dining for _faire jouer le t l graphe._\n\n\n\nEverything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from\nRussian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely\ndignified, simple, and enjoyable.",
      "The party some twenty had been\nselected by Sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of\nthe same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well\nbred.",
      "They drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal\nof the province, of the governor, of the bank director, and of  our\namiable host.",
      "Vronsky was satisfied.",
      "He had never expected to find so pleasant a tone\nin the provinces.",
      "Towards the end of dinner it was still more lively.",
      "The governor asked\nVronsky to come to a concert for the benefit of the Servians which his\nwife, who was anxious to make his acquaintance, had been getting up.",
      "There ll be a ball, and you ll see the belle of the province.",
      "Worth\nseeing, really.",
      "Not in my line,  Vronsky answered.",
      "He liked that English phrase.",
      "But\nhe smiled, and promised to come.",
      "Before they rose from the table, when all of them were smoking,\nVronsky s valet went up to him with a letter on a tray.",
      "From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,  he said with a significant\nexpression.",
      "Astonishing!",
      "how like he is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky,  said\none of the guests in French of the valet, while Vronsky, frowning, read\nthe letter.",
      "The letter was from Anna.",
      "Before he read the letter, he knew its\ncontents.",
      "Expecting the elections to be over in five days, he had\npromised to be back on Friday.",
      "Today was Saturday, and he knew that the\nletter contained reproaches for not being back at the time fixed.",
      "The\nletter he had sent the previous evening had probably not reached her\nyet.",
      "The letter was what he had expected, but the form of it was unexpected,\nand particularly disagreeable to him.",
      "Annie is very ill, the doctor\nsays it may be inflammation.",
      "I am losing my head all alone.",
      "Princess\nVarvara is no help, but a hindrance.",
      "I expected you the day before\nyesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you\nare and what you are doing.",
      "I wanted to come myself, but thought better\nof it, knowing you would dislike it.",
      "Send some answer, that I may know\nwhat to do.",
      "The child ill, yet she had thought of coming herself.",
      "Their daughter\nill, and this hostile tone.",
      "The innocent festivities over the election, and this gloomy, burdensome\nlove to which he had to return struck Vronsky by their contrast.",
      "But he\nhad to go, and by the first train that night he set off home.",
      "Chapter 32\n\nBefore Vronsky s departure for the elections, Anna had reflected that\nthe scenes constantly repeated between them each time he left home,\nmight only make him cold to her instead of attaching him to her, and\nresolved to do all she could to control herself so as to bear the\nparting with composure.",
      "But the cold, severe glance with which he had\nlooked at her when he came to tell her he was going had wounded her,\nand before he had started her peace of mind was destroyed.",
      "In solitude afterwards, thinking over that glance which had expressed\nhis right to freedom, she came, as she always did, to the same\npoint the sense of her own humiliation.",
      "He has the right to go away\nwhen and where he chooses.",
      "Not simply to go away, but to leave me.",
      "He\nhas every right, and I have none.",
      "But knowing that, he ought not to do\nit.",
      "What has he done, though?...",
      "He looked at me with a cold, severe\nexpression.",
      "Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it\nhas never been so before, and that glance means a great deal,  she\nthought.",
      "That glance shows the beginning of indifference.",
      "And though she felt sure that a coldness was beginning, there was\nnothing she could do, she could not in any way alter her relations to\nhim.",
      "Just as before, only by love and by charm could she keep him.",
      "And\nso, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at\nnight, could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he\nceased to love her.",
      "It is true there was still one means; not to keep\nhim for that she wanted nothing more than his love but to be nearer to\nhim, to be in such a position that he would not leave her.",
      "That means\nwas divorce and marriage.",
      "And she began to long for that, and made up\nher mind to agree to it the first time he or Stiva approached her on\nthe subject.",
      "Absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five\ndays that he was to be at the elections.",
      "Walks, conversation with Princess Varvara, visits to the hospital, and,\nmost of all, reading reading of one book after another filled up her\ntime.",
      "But on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him,\nshe felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of\nhim and of what he was doing there, just at that time her little girl\nwas taken ill. Anna began to look after her, but even that did not\ndistract her mind, especially as the illness was not serious.",
      "However\nhard she tried, she could not love this little child, and to feign love\nwas beyond her powers.",
      "Towards the evening of that day, still alone,\nAnna was in such a panic about him that she decided to start for the\ntown, but on second thoughts wrote him the contradictory letter that\nVronsky received, and without reading it through, sent it off by a\nspecial messenger.",
      "The next morning she received his letter and\nregretted her own.",
      "She dreaded a repetition of the severe look he had\nflung at her at parting, especially when he knew that the baby was not\ndangerously ill.",
      "But still she was glad she had written to him.",
      "At this\nmoment Anna was positively admitting to herself that she was a burden\nto him, that he would relinquish his freedom regretfully to return to\nher, and in spite of that she was glad he was coming.",
      "Let him weary of\nher, but he would be here with her, so that she would see him, would\nknow of every action he took.",
      "She was sitting in the drawing-room near a lamp, with a new volume of\nTaine, and as she read, listening to the sound of the wind outside, and\nevery minute expecting the carriage to arrive.",
      "Several times she had\nfancied she heard the sound of wheels, but she had been mistaken.",
      "At\nlast she heard not the sound of wheels, but the coachman s shout and\nthe dull rumble in the covered entry.",
      "Even Princess Varvara, playing\npatience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing hotly, got up; but instead\nof going down, as she had done twice before, she stood still.",
      "She\nsuddenly felt ashamed of her duplicity, but even more she dreaded how\nhe might meet her.",
      "All feeling of wounded pride had passed now; she was\nonly afraid of the expression of his displeasure.",
      "She remembered that\nher child had been perfectly well again for the last two days.",
      "She felt\npositively vexed with her for getting better from the very moment her\nletter was sent off.",
      "Then she thought of him, that he was here, all of\nhim, with his hands, his eyes.",
      "She heard his voice.",
      "And forgetting\neverything, she ran joyfully to meet him.",
      "Well, how is Annie?",
      "he said timidly from below, looking up to Anna as\nshe ran down to him.",
      "He was sitting on a chair, and a footman was pulling off his warm\nover-boot.",
      "Oh, she is better.",
      "And you?",
      "he said, shaking himself.",
      "She took his hand in both of hers, and drew it to her waist, never\ntaking her eyes off him.",
      "Well, I m glad,  he said, coldly scanning her, her hair, her dress,\nwhich he knew she had put on for him.",
      "All was charming, but how many\ntimes it had charmed him!",
      "And the stern, stony expression that she so\ndreaded settled upon his face.",
      "Well, I m glad.",
      "And are you well?",
      "he said, wiping his damp beard with\nhis handkerchief and kissing her hand.",
      "Never mind,  she thought,  only let him be here, and so long as he s\nhere he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.",
      "The evening was spent happily and gaily in the presence of Princess\nVarvara, who complained to him that Anna had been taking morphine in\nhis absence.",
      "What am I to do?",
      "I couldn t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me.",
      "When\nhe s here I never take it hardly ever.",
      "He told her about the election, and Anna knew how by adroit questions\nto bring him to what gave him most pleasure his own success.",
      "She told\nhim of everything that interested him at home; and all that she told\nhim was of the most cheerful description.",
      "But late in the evening, when they were alone, Anna, seeing that she\nhad regained complete possession of him, wanted to erase the painful\nimpression of the glance he had given her for her letter.",
      "She said:\n\n Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn t\nbelieve me?",
      "As soon as she had said it, she felt that however warm his feelings\nwere to her, he had not forgiven her for that.",
      "Yes,  he said,  the letter was so strange.",
      "First, Annie ill, and then\nyou thought of coming yourself.",
      "It was all the truth.",
      "Oh, I don t doubt it.",
      "Yes, you do doubt it.",
      "You are vexed, I see.",
      "Not for one moment.",
      "I m only vexed, that s true, that you seem somehow\nunwilling to admit that there are duties....",
      "The duty of going to a concert....",
      "But we won t talk about it,  he said.",
      "Why not talk about it?",
      "she said.",
      "I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up.",
      "Now,\nfor instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the\nhouse.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable?",
      "Don t you know that I\ncan t live without you?",
      "If so,  said Anna, her voice suddenly changing,  it means that you are\nsick of this life....",
      "Yes, you will come for a day and go away, as men\ndo.... \n\n Anna, that s cruel.",
      "I am ready to give up my whole life.",
      "But she did not hear him.",
      "If you go to Moscow, I will go too.",
      "I will not stay here.",
      "Either we\nmust separate or else live together.",
      "Why, you know, that s my one desire.",
      "But for that.... \n\n We must get a divorce.",
      "I will write to him.",
      "I see I cannot go on like\nthis....",
      "But I will come with you to Moscow.",
      "You talk as if you were threatening me.",
      "But I desire nothing so much\nas never to be parted from you,  said Vronsky, smiling.",
      "But as he said these words there gleamed in his eyes not merely a cold\nlook, but the vindictive look of a man persecuted and made cruel.",
      "She saw the look and correctly divined its meaning.",
      "If so, it s a calamity!",
      "that glance told her.",
      "It was a moment s\nimpression, but she never forgot it.",
      "Anna wrote to her husband asking him about a divorce, and towards the\nend of November, taking leave of Princess Varvara, who wanted to go to\nPetersburg, she went with Vronsky to Moscow.",
      "Expecting every day an\nanswer from Alexey Alexandrovitch, and after that the divorce, they now\nestablished themselves together like married people.",
      "PART SEVEN\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nThe Levins had been three months in Moscow.",
      "The date had long passed on\nwhich, according to the most trustworthy calculations of people learned\nin such matters, Kitty should have been confined.",
      "But she was still\nabout, and there was nothing to show that her time was any nearer than\ntwo months ago.",
      "The doctor, the monthly nurse, and Dolly and her\nmother, and most of all Levin, who could not think of the approaching\nevent without terror, began to be impatient and uneasy.",
      "Kitty was the\nonly person who felt perfectly calm and happy.",
      "She was distinctly conscious now of the birth of a new feeling of love\nfor the future child, for her to some extent actually existing already,\nand she brooded blissfully over this feeling.",
      "He was not by now\naltogether a part of herself, but sometimes lived his own life\nindependently of her.",
      "Often this separate being gave her pain, but at\nthe same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.",
      "All the people she loved were with her, and all were so good to her, so\nattentively caring for her, so entirely pleasant was everything\npresented to her, that if she had not known and felt that it must all\nsoon be over, she could not have wished for a better and pleasanter\nlife.",
      "The only thing that spoiled the charm of this manner of life was\nthat her husband was not here as she loved him to be, and as he was in\nthe country.",
      "She liked his serene, friendly, and hospitable manner in the country.",
      "In the town he seemed continually uneasy and on his guard, as though he\nwere afraid someone would be rude to him, and still more to her.",
      "At\nhome in the country, knowing himself distinctly to be in his right\nplace, he was never in haste to be off elsewhere.",
      "He was never\nunoccupied.",
      "Here in town he was in a continual hurry, as though afraid\nof missing something, and yet he had nothing to do.",
      "And she felt sorry\nfor him.",
      "To others, she knew, he did not appear an object of pity.",
      "On\nthe contrary, when Kitty looked at him in society, as one sometimes\nlooks at those one loves, trying to see him as if he were a stranger,\nso as to catch the impression he must make on others, she saw with a\npanic even of jealous fear that he was far indeed from being a pitiable\nfigure, that he was very attractive with his fine breeding, his rather\nold-fashioned, reserved courtesy with women, his powerful figure, and\nstriking, as she thought, and expressive face.",
      "But she saw him not from\nwithout, but from within; she saw that here he was not himself; that\nwas the only way she could define his condition to herself.",
      "Sometimes\nshe inwardly reproached him for his inability to live in the town;\nsometimes she recognized that it was really hard for him to order his\nlife here so that he could be satisfied with it.",
      "What had he to do, indeed?",
      "He did not care for cards; he did not go to\na club.",
      "Spending the time with jovial gentlemen of Oblonsky s type she\nknew now what that meant ... it meant drinking and going somewhere\nafter drinking.",
      "She could not think without horror of where men went on\nsuch occasions.",
      "Was he to go into society?",
      "But she knew he could only\nfind satisfaction in that if he took pleasure in the society of young\nwomen, and that she could not wish for.",
      "Should he stay at home with\nher, her mother and her sisters?",
      "But much as she liked and enjoyed\ntheir conversations forever on the same subjects Aline-Nadine,  as the\nold prince called the sisters  talks she knew it must bore him.",
      "What\nwas there left for him to do?",
      "To go on writing at his book he had\nindeed attempted, and at first he used to go to the library and make\nextracts and look up references for his book.",
      "But, as he told her, the\nmore he did nothing, the less time he had to do anything.",
      "And besides,\nhe complained that he had talked too much about his book here, and that\nconsequently all his ideas about it were muddled and had lost their\ninterest for him.",
      "One advantage in this town life was that quarrels hardly ever happened\nbetween them here in town.",
      "Whether it was that their conditions were\ndifferent, or that they had both become more careful and sensible in\nthat respect, they had no quarrels in Moscow from jealousy, which they\nhad so dreaded when they moved from the country.",
      "One event, an event of great importance to both from that point of\nview, did indeed happen that was Kitty s meeting with Vronsky.",
      "The old Princess Marya Borissovna, Kitty s godmother, who had always\nbeen very fond of her, had insisted on seeing her.",
      "Kitty, though she\ndid not go into society at all on account of her condition, went with\nher father to see the venerable old lady, and there met Vronsky.",
      "The only thing Kitty could reproach herself for at this meeting was\nthat at the instant when she recognized in his civilian dress the\nfeatures once so familiar to her, her breath failed her, the blood\nrushed to her heart, and a vivid blush she felt it overspread her face.",
      "But this lasted only a few seconds.",
      "Before her father, who purposely\nbegan talking in a loud voice to Vronsky, had finished, she was\nperfectly ready to look at Vronsky, to speak to him, if necessary,\nexactly as she spoke to Princess Marya Borissovna, and more than that,\nto do so in such a way that everything to the faintest intonation and\nsmile would have been approved by her husband, whose unseen presence\nshe seemed to feel about her at that instant.",
      "She said a few words to him, even smiled serenely at his joke about the\nelections, which he called  our parliament.",
      "(She had to smile to show\nshe saw the joke.)",
      "But she turned away immediately to Princess Marya\nBorissovna, and did not once glance at him till he got up to go; then\nshe looked at him, but evidently only because it would be uncivil not\nto look at a man when he is saying good-bye.",
      "She was grateful to her father for saying nothing to her about their\nmeeting Vronsky, but she saw by his special warmth to her after the\nvisit during their usual walk that he was pleased with her.",
      "She was\npleased with herself.",
      "She had not expected she would have had the\npower, while keeping somewhere in the bottom of her heart all the\nmemories of her old feeling for Vronsky, not only to seem but to be\nperfectly indifferent and composed with him.",
      "Levin flushed a great deal more than she when she told him she had met\nVronsky at Princess Marya Borissovna s. It was very hard for her to\ntell him this, but still harder to go on speaking of the details of the\nmeeting, as he did not question her, but simply gazed at her with a\nfrown.",
      "I am very sorry you weren t there,  she said.",
      "Not that you weren t in\nthe room ...",
      "I couldn t have been so natural in your presence ...",
      "I am\nblushing now much more, much, much more,  she said, blushing till the\ntears came into her eyes.",
      "But that you couldn t see through a crack.",
      "The truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself, and\nin spite of her blushing he was quickly reassured and began questioning\nher, which was all she wanted.",
      "When he had heard everything, even to\nthe detail that for the first second she could not help flushing, but\nthat afterwards she was just as direct and as much at her ease as with\nany chance acquaintance, Levin was quite happy again and said he was\nglad of it, and would not now behave as stupidly as he had done at the\nelection, but would try the first time he met Vronsky to be as friendly\nas possible.",
      "It s so wretched to feel that there s a man almost an enemy whom it s\npainful to meet,  said Levin.",
      "I m very, very glad.",
      "Chapter 2\n\n Go, please, go then and call on the Bols,  Kitty said to her husband,\nwhen he came in to see her at eleven o clock before going out.",
      "I know\nyou are dining at the club; papa put down your name.",
      "But what are you\ngoing to do in the morning?",
      "I am only going to Katavasov,  answered Levin.",
      "Why so early?",
      "He promised to introduce me to Metrov.",
      "I wanted to talk to him about\nmy work.",
      "He s a distinguished scientific man from Petersburg,  said\nLevin.",
      "Yes; wasn t it his article you were praising so?",
      "Well, and after\nthat?",
      "said Kitty.",
      "I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister s business.",
      "And the concert?",
      "she queried.",
      "I shan t go there all alone.",
      "No?",
      "do go; there are going to be some new things.... That interested\nyou so.",
      "I should certainly go.",
      "Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner,  he said, looking at\nhis watch.",
      "Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on\nCountess Bola.",
      "But is it absolutely necessary?",
      "Oh, absolutely!",
      "He has been to see us.",
      "Come, what is it?",
      "You go in,\nsit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go away.",
      "Oh, you wouldn t believe it!",
      "I ve got so out of the way of all this\nthat it makes me feel positively ashamed.",
      "It s such a horrible thing to\ndo!",
      "A complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to\ndo, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!",
      "Kitty laughed.",
      "Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn t\nyou?",
      "Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I m so out of the way\nof it that, by Jove!",
      "I d sooner go two days running without my dinner\nthan pay this call!",
      "One s so ashamed!",
      "I feel all the while that they re\nannoyed, that they re saying,  What has he come for?",
      "No, they won t. I ll answer for that,  said Kitty, looking into his\nface with a laugh.",
      "She took his hand.",
      "Well, good-bye.... Do go,\nplease.",
      "He was just going out after kissing his wife s hand, when she stopped\nhim.",
      "Kostya, do you know I ve only fifty roubles left?",
      "Oh, all right, I ll go to the bank and get some.",
      "How much?",
      "he said,\nwith the expression of dissatisfaction she knew so well.",
      "No, wait a minute.",
      "She held his hand.",
      "Let s talk about it, it\nworries me.",
      "I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but money seems to fly\naway simply.",
      "We don t manage well, somehow.",
      "Oh, it s all right,  he said with a little cough, looking at her from\nunder his brows.",
      "That cough she knew well.",
      "It was a sign of intense dissatisfaction, not\nwith her, but with himself.",
      "He certainly was displeased not at so much\nmoney being spent, but at being reminded of what he, knowing something\nwas unsatisfactory, wanted to forget.",
      "I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the\nmill.",
      "We shall have money enough in any case.",
      "Yes, but I m afraid that altogether.... \n\n Oh, it s all right, all right,  he repeated.",
      "Well, good-bye,\ndarling.",
      "No, I m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma.",
      "How nice it\nwould have been in the country!",
      "As it is, I m worrying you all, and\nwe re wasting our money.",
      "Not at all, not at all.",
      "Not once since I ve been married have I said\nthat things could have been better than they are....",
      "Truly?",
      "she said, looking into his eyes.",
      "He had said it without thinking, simply to console her.",
      "But when he\nglanced at her and saw those sweet truthful eyes fastened questioningly\non him, he repeated it with his whole heart.",
      "I was positively\nforgetting her,  he thought.",
      "And he remembered what was before them, so\nsoon to come.",
      "Will it be soon?",
      "How do you feel?",
      "he whispered, taking her two hands.",
      "I have so often thought so, that now I don t think about it or know\nanything about it.",
      "And you re not frightened?",
      "She smiled contemptuously.",
      "Not the least little bit,  she said.",
      "Well, if anything happens, I shall be at Katavasov s. \n\n No, nothing will happen, and don t think about it.",
      "I m going for a\nwalk on the boulevard with papa.",
      "We re going to see Dolly.",
      "I shall\nexpect you before dinner.",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "Do you know that Dolly s position is\nbecoming utterly impossible?",
      "She s in debt all round; she hasn t a\npenny.",
      "We were talking yesterday with mamma and Arseny  (this was her\nsister s husband Lvov),  and we determined to send you with him to talk\nto Stiva.",
      "It s really unbearable.",
      "One can t speak to papa about it....",
      "But if you and he.... \n\n Why, what can we do?",
      "said Levin.",
      "You ll be at Arseny s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we\ndecided.",
      "Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand.",
      "I ll go and see\nhim.",
      "By the way, if I do go to the concert, I ll go with Natalia.",
      "Well,\ngood-bye.",
      "On the steps Levin was stopped by his old servant Kouzma, who had been\nwith him before his marriage, and now looked after their household in\ntown.",
      "Beauty  (that was the left shaft-horse brought up from the country)\n has been badly shod and is quite lame,  he said.",
      "What does your honor\nwish to be done?",
      "During the first part of their stay in Moscow, Levin had used his own\nhorses brought up from the country.",
      "He had tried to arrange this part\nof their expenses in the best and cheapest way possible; but it\nappeared that their own horses came dearer than hired horses, and they\nstill hired too.",
      "Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.",
      "And for Katerina Alexandrovna?",
      "asked Kouzma.",
      "Levin was not by now struck as he had been at first by the fact that to\nget from one end of Moscow to the other he had to have two powerful\nhorses put into a heavy carriage, to take the carriage three miles\nthrough the snowy slush and to keep it standing there four hours,\npaying five roubles every time.",
      "Now it seemed quite natural.",
      "Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,  said he.",
      "Yes, sir.",
      "And so, simply and easily, thanks to the facilities of town life, Levin\nsettled a question which, in the country, would have called for so much\npersonal trouble and exertion, and going out onto the steps, he called\na sledge, sat down, and drove to Nikitsky.",
      "On the way he thought no\nmore of money, but mused on the introduction that awaited him to the\nPetersburg savant, a writer on sociology, and what he would say to him\nabout his book.",
      "Only during the first days of his stay in Moscow Levin had been struck\nby the expenditure, strange to one living in the country, unproductive\nbut inevitable, that was expected of him on every side.",
      "But by now he\nhad grown used to it.",
      "That had happened to him in this matter which is\nsaid to happen to drunkards the first glass sticks in the throat, the\nsecond flies down like a hawk, but after the third they re like tiny\nlittle birds.",
      "When Levin had changed his first hundred-rouble note to\npay for liveries for his footmen and hall-porter he could not help\nreflecting that these liveries were of no use to anyone but they were\nindubitably necessary, to judge by the amazement of the princess and\nKitty when he suggested that they might do without liveries, that these\nliveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer, that is,\nwould pay for about three hundred working days from Easter to Ash\nWednesday, and each a day of hard work from early morning to late\nevening and that hundred-rouble note did stick in his throat.",
      "But the\nnext note, changed to pay for providing a dinner for their relations,\nthat cost twenty-eight roubles, though it did excite in Levin the\nreflection that twenty-eight roubles meant nine measures of oats, which\nmen would with groans and sweat have reaped and bound and thrashed and\nwinnowed and sifted and sown, this next one he parted with more easily.",
      "And now the notes he changed no longer aroused such reflections, and\nthey flew off like little birds.",
      "Whether the labor devoted to obtaining\nthe money corresponded to the pleasure given by what was bought with\nit, was a consideration he had long ago dismissed.",
      "His business\ncalculation that there was a certain price below which he could not\nsell certain grain was forgotten too.",
      "The rye, for the price of which\nhe had so long held out, had been sold for fifty kopecks a measure\ncheaper than it had been fetching a month ago.",
      "Even the consideration\nthat with such an expenditure he could not go on living for a year\nwithout debt, that even had no force.",
      "Only one thing was essential: to\nhave money in the bank, without inquiring where it came from, so as to\nknow that one had the wherewithal to buy meat for tomorrow.",
      "And this\ncondition had hitherto been fulfilled; he had always had the money in\nthe bank.",
      "But now the money in the bank had gone, and he could not\nquite tell where to get the next installment.",
      "And this it was which, at\nthe moment when Kitty had mentioned money, had disturbed him; but he\nhad no time to think about it.",
      "He drove off, thinking of Katavasov and\nthe meeting with Metrov that was before him.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nLevin had on this visit to town seen a great deal of his old friend at\nthe university, Professor Katavasov, whom he had not seen since his\nmarriage.",
      "He liked in Katavasov the clearness and simplicity of his\nconception of life.",
      "Levin thought that the clearness of Katavasov s\nconception of life was due to the poverty of his nature; Katavasov\nthought that the disconnectedness of Levin s ideas was due to his lack\nof intellectual discipline; but Levin enjoyed Katavasov s clearness,\nand Katavasov enjoyed the abundance of Levin s untrained ideas, and\nthey liked to meet and to discuss.",
      "Levin had read Katavasov some parts of his book, and he had liked them.",
      "On the previous day Katavasov had met Levin at a public lecture and\ntold him that the celebrated Metrov, whose article Levin had so much\nliked, was in Moscow, that he had been much interested by what\nKatavasov had told him about Levin s work, and that he was coming to\nsee him tomorrow at eleven, and would be very glad to make Levin s\nacquaintance.",
      "You re positively a reformed character, I m glad to see,  said\nKatavasov, meeting Levin in the little drawing-room.",
      "I heard the bell\nand thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!...",
      "Well,\nwhat do you say to the Montenegrins now?",
      "They re a race of warriors.",
      "Why, what s happened?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "Katavasov in a few words told him the last piece of news from the war,\nand going into his study, introduced Levin to a short, thick-set man of\npleasant appearance.",
      "This was Metrov.",
      "The conversation touched for a\nbrief space on politics and on how recent events were looked at in the\nhigher spheres in Petersburg.",
      "Metrov repeated a saying that had reached\nhim through a most trustworthy source, reported as having been uttered\non this subject by the Tsar and one of the ministers.",
      "Katavasov had\nheard also on excellent authority that the Tsar had said something\nquite different.",
      "Levin tried to imagine circumstances in which both\nsayings might have been uttered, and the conversation on that topic\ndropped.",
      "Yes, here he s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the\nlaborer in relation to the land,  said Katavasov;  I m not a\nspecialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not\ntaking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the\ncontrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that\ndependence seeking the laws of his development.",
      "That s very interesting,  said Metrov.",
      "What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but\nstudying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,  said Levin,\nreddening,  I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.",
      "And Levin began carefully, as it were, feeling his ground, to expound\nhis views.",
      "He knew Metrov had written an article against the generally\naccepted theory of political economy, but to what extent he could\nreckon on his sympathy with his own new views he did not know and could\nnot guess from the clever and serene face of the learned man.",
      "But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian\nlaborer?",
      "said Metrov;  in his biological characteristics, so to speak,\nor in the condition in which he is placed?",
      "Levin saw that there was an idea underlying this question with which he\ndid not agree.",
      "But he went on explaining his own idea that the Russian\nlaborer has a quite special view of the land, different from that of\nother people; and to support this proposition he made haste to add that\nin his opinion this attitude of the Russian peasant was due to the\nconsciousness of his vocation to people vast unoccupied expanses in the\nEast.",
      "One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the\ngeneral vocation of a people,  said Metrov, interrupting Levin.",
      "The\ncondition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land\nand to capital.",
      "And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea, Metrov began\nexpounding to him the special point of his own theory.",
      "In what the point of his theory lay, Levin did not understand, because\nhe did not take the trouble to understand.",
      "He saw that Metrov, like\nother people, in spite of his own article, in which he had attacked the\ncurrent theory of political economy, looked at the position of the\nRussian peasant simply from the point of view of capital, wages, and\nrent.",
      "He would indeed have been obliged to admit that in the\neastern much the larger part of Russia rent was as yet nil, that for\nnine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian peasants wages took\nthe form simply of food provided for themselves, and that capital does\nnot so far exist except in the form of the most primitive tools.",
      "Yet it\nwas only from that point of view that he considered every laborer,\nthough in many points he differed from the economists and had his own\ntheory of the wage-fund, which he expounded to Levin.",
      "Levin listened reluctantly, and at first made objections.",
      "He would have\nliked to interrupt Metrov, to explain his own thought, which in his\nopinion would have rendered further exposition of Metrov s theories\nsuperfluous.",
      "But later on, feeling convinced that they looked at the\nmatter so differently, that they could never understand one another, he\ndid not even oppose his statements, but simply listened.",
      "Although what\nMetrov was saying was by now utterly devoid of interest for him, he yet\nexperienced a certain satisfaction in listening to him.",
      "It flattered\nhis vanity that such a learned man should explain his ideas to him so\neagerly, with such intensity and confidence in Levin s understanding of\nthe subject, sometimes with a mere hint referring him to a whole aspect\nof the subject.",
      "He put this down to his own credit, unaware that\nMetrov, who had already discussed his theory over and over again with\nall his intimate friends, talked of it with special eagerness to every\nnew person, and in general was eager to talk to anyone of any subject\nthat interested him, even if still obscure to himself.",
      "We are late though,  said Katavasov, looking at his watch directly\nMetrov had finished his discourse.",
      "Yes, there s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in\ncommemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,  said Katavasov in answer to\nLevin s inquiry.",
      "Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going.",
      "I ve promised to\ndeliver an address on his labors in zoology.",
      "Come along with us, it s\nvery interesting.",
      "Yes, and indeed it s time to start,  said Metrov.",
      "Come with us, and\nfrom there, if you care to, come to my place.",
      "I should very much like\nto hear your work.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "It s no good yet, it s unfinished.",
      "But I shall be very glad to\ngo to the meeting.",
      "I say, friends, have you heard?",
      "He has handed in the separate report, \nKatavasov called from the other room, where he was putting on his frock\ncoat.",
      "And a conversation sprang up upon the university question, which was a\nvery important event that winter in Moscow.",
      "Three old professors in the\ncouncil had not accepted the opinion of the younger professors.",
      "The\nyoung ones had registered a separate resolution.",
      "This, in the judgment\nof some people, was monstrous, in the judgment of others it was the\nsimplest and most just thing to do, and the professors were split up\ninto two parties.",
      "One party, to which Katavasov belonged, saw in the opposite party a\nscoundrelly betrayal and treachery, while the opposite party saw in\nthem childishness and lack of respect for the authorities.",
      "Levin,\nthough he did not belong to the university, had several times already\nduring his stay in Moscow heard and talked about this matter, and had\nhis own opinion on the subject.",
      "He took part in the conversation that\nwas continued in the street, as they all three walked to the buildings\nof the old university.",
      "The meeting had already begun.",
      "Round the cloth-covered table, at which\nKatavasov and Metrov seated themselves, there were some half-dozen\npersons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript, reading\nsomething aloud.",
      "Levin sat down in one of the empty chairs that were\nstanding round the table, and in a whisper asked a student sitting near\nwhat was being read.",
      "The student, eyeing Levin with displeasure, said:\n\n Biography.",
      "Though Levin was not interested in the biography, he could not help\nlistening, and learned some new and interesting facts about the life of\nthe distinguished man of science.",
      "When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read some\nverses of the poet Ment sent him on the jubilee, and said a few words\nby way of thanks to the poet.",
      "Then Katavasov in his loud, ringing voice\nread his address on the scientific labors of the man whose jubilee was\nbeing kept.",
      "When Katavasov had finished, Levin looked at his watch, saw it was past\none, and thought that there would not be time before the concert to\nread Metrov his book, and indeed, he did not now care to do so.",
      "During\nthe reading he had thought over their conversation.",
      "He saw distinctly\nnow that though Metrov s ideas might perhaps have value, his own ideas\nhad a value too, and their ideas could only be made clear and lead to\nsomething if each worked separately in his chosen path, and that\nnothing would be gained by putting their ideas together.",
      "And having\nmade up his mind to refuse Metrov s invitation, Levin went up to him at\nthe end of the meeting.",
      "Metrov introduced Levin to the chairman, with\nwhom he was talking of the political news.",
      "Metrov told the chairman\nwhat he had already told Levin, and Levin made the same remarks on his\nnews that he had already made that morning, but for the sake of variety\nhe expressed also a new opinion which had only just struck him.",
      "After\nthat the conversation turned again on the university question.",
      "As Levin\nhad already heard it all, he made haste to tell Metrov that he was\nsorry he could not take advantage of his invitation, took leave, and\ndrove to Lvov s.\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nLvov, the husband of Natalia, Kitty s sister, had spent all his life in\nforeign capitals, where he had been educated, and had been in the\ndiplomatic service.",
      "During the previous year he had left the diplomatic service, not owing\nto any  unpleasantness  (he never had any  unpleasantness  with\nanyone), and was transferred to the department of the court of the\npalace in Moscow, in order to give his two boys the best education\npossible.",
      "In spite of the striking contrast in their habits and views and the\nfact that Lvov was older than Levin, they had seen a great deal of one\nanother that winter, and had taken a great liking to each other.",
      "Lvov was at home, and Levin went in to him unannounced.",
      "Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was\nsitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was\nreading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful\nhand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him.",
      "His handsome, delicate, and still youthful-looking face, to which his\ncurly, glistening silvery hair gave a still more aristocratic air,\nlighted up with a smile when he saw Levin.",
      "Capital!",
      "I was meaning to send to you.",
      "How s Kitty?",
      "Sit here, it s\nmore comfortable.",
      "He got up and pushed up a rocking chair.",
      "Have you\nread the last circular in the _Journal de St. P tersbourg?_ I think\nit s excellent,  he said, with a slight French accent.",
      "Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov was being said in\nPetersburg, and after talking a little about politics, he told him of\nhis interview with Metrov, and the learned society s meeting.",
      "To Lvov\nit was very interesting.",
      "That s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting\nscientific circles,  he said.",
      "And as he talked, he passed as usual into\nFrench, which was easier to him.",
      "It s true I haven t the time for it.",
      "My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I m not\nashamed to own that my education has been too defective.",
      "That I don t believe,  said Levin with a smile, feeling, as he always\ndid, touched at Lvov s low opinion of himself, which was not in the\nleast put on from a desire to seem or to be modest, but was absolutely\nsincere.",
      "Oh, yes, indeed!",
      "I feel now how badly educated I am.",
      "To educate my\nchildren I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply\nto study myself.",
      "For it s not enough to have teachers, there must be\nsomeone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and\nan overseer.",
      "See what I m reading he pointed to Buslaev s _Grammar_ on\nthe desk it s expected of Misha, and it s so difficult.... Come,\nexplain to me....",
      "Here he says.... \n\nLevin tried to explain to him that it couldn t be understood, but that\nit had to be taught; but Lvov would not agree with him.",
      "Oh, you re laughing at it!",
      "On the contrary, you can t imagine how, when I look at you, I m always\nlearning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one s\nchildren.",
      "Well, there s nothing for you to learn,  said Lvov.",
      "All I know,  said Levin,  is that I have never seen better brought-up\nchildren than yours, and I wouldn t wish for children better than\nyours.",
      "Lvov visibly tried to restrain the expression of his delight, but he\nwas positively radiant with smiles.",
      "If only they re better than I!",
      "That s all I desire.",
      "You don t know yet\nall the work,  he said,  with boys who ve been left like mine to run\nwild abroad.",
      "You ll catch all that up.",
      "They re such clever children.",
      "The great\nthing is the education of character.",
      "That s what I learn when I look at\nyour children.",
      "You talk of the education of character.",
      "You can t imagine how\ndifficult that is!",
      "You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency\nwhen others crop up, and the struggle begins again.",
      "If one had not a\nsupport in religion you remember we talked about that no father could\nbring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.",
      "This subject, which always interested Levin, was cut short by the\nentrance of the beauty Natalia Alexandrovna, dressed to go out.",
      "I didn t know you were here,  she said, unmistakably feeling no\nregret, but a positive pleasure, in interrupting this conversation on a\ntopic she had heard so much of that she was by now weary of it.",
      "Well,\nhow is Kitty?",
      "I am dining with you today.",
      "I tell you what, Arseny,  she\nturned to her husband,  you take the carriage.",
      "And the husband and wife began to discuss their arrangements for the\nday.",
      "As the husband had to drive to meet someone on official business,\nwhile the wife had to go to the concert and some public meeting of a\ncommittee on the Eastern Question, there was a great deal to consider\nand settle.",
      "Levin had to take part in their plans as one of themselves.",
      "It was settled that Levin should go with Natalia to the concert and the\nmeeting, and that from there they should send the carriage to the\noffice for Arseny, and he should call for her and take her to Kitty s;\nor that, if he had not finished his work, he should send the carriage\nback and Levin would go with her.",
      "He s spoiling me,  Lvov said to his wife;  he assures me that our\nchildren are splendid, when I know how much that s bad there is in\nthem.",
      "Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,  said his wife.",
      "If you look\nfor perfection, you will never be satisfied.",
      "And it s true, as papa\nsays, that when we were brought up there was one extreme we were kept\nin the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it s\njust the other way the parents are in the wash house, while the\nchildren are in the best rooms.",
      "Parents now are not expected to live at\nall, but to exist altogether for their children.",
      "Well, what if they like it better?",
      "Lvov said, with his beautiful\nsmile, touching her hand.",
      "Anyone who didn t know you would think you\nwere a stepmother, not a true mother.",
      "No, extremes are not good in anything,  Natalia said serenely, putting\nhis paper-knife straight in its proper place on the table.",
      "Well, come here, you perfect children,  Lvov said to the two handsome\nboys who came in, and after bowing to Levin, went up to their father,\nobviously wishing to ask him about something.",
      "Levin would have liked to talk to them, to hear what they would say to\ntheir father, but Natalia began talking to him, and then Lvov s\ncolleague in the service, Mahotin, walked in, wearing his court\nuniform, to go with him to meet someone, and a conversation was kept up\nwithout a break upon Herzegovina, Princess Korzinskaya, the town\ncouncil, and the sudden death of Madame Apraksina.",
      "Levin even forgot the commission intrusted to him.",
      "He recollected it as\nhe was going into the hall.",
      "Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,  he said, as Lvov was\nstanding on the stairs, seeing his wife and Levin off.",
      "Yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-fr res,_ to attack him,  he said,\nblushing.",
      "But why should I?",
      "Well, then, I will attack him,  said Madame Lvova, with a smile,\nstanding in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished\nspeaking.",
      "Come, let us go.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nAt the concert in the afternoon two very interesting things were\nperformed.",
      "One was a fantasia, _King Lear;_ the other was a quartette\ndedicated to the memory of Bach.",
      "Both were new and in the new style,\nand Levin was eager to form an opinion of them.",
      "After escorting his\nsister-in-law to her stall, he stood against a column and tried to\nlisten as attentively and conscientiously as possible.",
      "He tried not to\nlet his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by\nlooking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always\ndisturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets,\nwith strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people\neither thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things\nexcept the music.",
      "He tried to avoid meeting musical connoisseurs or\ntalkative acquaintances, and stood looking at the floor straight before\nhim, listening.",
      "But the more he listened to the fantasia of _King Lear_ the further he\nfelt from forming any definite opinion of it.",
      "There was, as it were, a\ncontinual beginning, a preparation of the musical expression of some\nfeeling, but it fell to pieces again directly, breaking into new\nmusical motives, or simply nothing but the whims of the composer,\nexceedingly complex but disconnected sounds.",
      "And these fragmentary\nmusical expressions, though sometimes beautiful, were disagreeable,\nbecause they were utterly unexpected and not led up to by anything.",
      "Gaiety and grief and despair and tenderness and triumph followed one\nanother without any connection, like the emotions of a madman.",
      "And\nthose emotions, like a madman s, sprang up quite unexpectedly.",
      "During the whole of the performance Levin felt like a deaf man watching\npeople dancing, and was in a state of complete bewilderment when the\nfantasia was over, and felt a great weariness from the fruitless strain\non his attention.",
      "Loud applause resounded on all sides.",
      "Everyone got\nup, moved about, and began talking.",
      "Anxious to throw some light on his\nown perplexity from the impressions of others, Levin began to walk\nabout, looking for connoisseurs, and was glad to see a well-known\nmusical amateur in conversation with Pestsov, whom he knew.",
      "Marvelous!",
      "Pestsov was saying in his mellow bass.",
      "How are you,\nKonstantin Dmitrievitch?",
      "Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to\nsay, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia s\napproach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with\nfate.",
      "Isn t it?",
      "You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?",
      "Levin asked timidly,\nforgetting that the fantasia was supposed to represent King Lear.",
      "Cordelia comes in ... see here!",
      "said Pestsov, tapping his finger on\nthe satiny surface of the program he held in his hand and passing it to\nLevin.",
      "Only then Levin recollected the title of the fantasia, and made haste\nto read in the Russian translation the lines from Shakespeare that were\nprinted on the back of the program.",
      "You can t follow it without that,  said Pestsov, addressing Levin, as\nthe person he had been speaking to had gone away, and he had no one to\ntalk to.",
      "In the _entr acte_ Levin and Pestsov fell into an argument upon the\nmerits and defects of music of the Wagner school.",
      "Levin maintained that\nthe mistake of Wagner and all his followers lay in their trying to take\nmusic into the sphere of another art, just as poetry goes wrong when it\ntries to paint a face as the art of painting ought to do, and as an\ninstance of this mistake he cited the sculptor who carved in marble\ncertain poetic phantasms flitting round the figure of the poet on the\npedestal.",
      "These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they\nwere positively clinging on the ladder,  said Levin.",
      "The comparison\npleased him, but he could not remember whether he had not used the same\nphrase before, and to Pestsov, too, and as he said it he felt confused.",
      "Pestsov maintained that art is one, and that it can attain its highest\nmanifestations only by conjunction with all kinds of art.",
      "The second piece that was performed Levin could not hear.",
      "Pestsov, who\nwas standing beside him, was talking to him almost all the time,\ncondemning the music for its excessive affected assumption of\nsimplicity, and comparing it with the simplicity of the Pre-Raphaelites\nin painting.",
      "As he went out Levin met many more acquaintances, with\nwhom he talked of politics, of music, and of common acquaintances.",
      "Among others he met Count Bol, whom he had utterly forgotten to call\nupon.",
      "Well, go at once then,  Madame Lvova said, when he told her;  perhaps\nthey ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch\nme.",
      "You ll find me still there.",
      "Chapter 6\n\n Perhaps they re not at home?",
      "said Levin, as he went into the hall of\nCountess Bola s house.",
      "At home; please walk in,  said the porter, resolutely removing his\novercoat.",
      "How annoying!",
      "thought Levin with a sigh, taking off one glove and\nstroking his hat.",
      "What did I come for?",
      "What have I to say to them?",
      "As he passed through the first drawing-room Levin met in the doorway\nCountess Bola, giving some order to a servant with a care-worn and\nsevere face.",
      "On seeing Levin she smiled, and asked him to come into the\nlittle drawing-room, where he heard voices.",
      "In this room there were\nsitting in armchairs the two daughters of the countess, and a Moscow\ncolonel, whom Levin knew.",
      "Levin went up, greeted them, and sat down\nbeside the sofa with his hat on his knees.",
      "How is your wife?",
      "Have you been at the concert?",
      "We couldn t go.",
      "Mamma\nhad to be at the funeral service.",
      "Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!",
      "said Levin.",
      "The countess came in, sat down on the sofa, and she too asked after his\nwife and inquired about the concert.",
      "Levin answered, and repeated an inquiry about Madame Apraksina s sudden\ndeath.",
      "But she was always in weak health.",
      "Were you at the opera yesterday?",
      "Yes, I was.",
      "Lucca was very good.",
      "Yes, very good,  he said, and as it was utterly of no consequence to\nhim what they thought of him, he began repeating what they had heard a\nhundred times about the characteristics of the singer s talent.",
      "Countess Bola pretended to be listening.",
      "Then, when he had said enough\nand paused, the colonel, who had been silent till then, began to talk.",
      "The colonel too talked of the opera, and about culture.",
      "At last, after\nspeaking of the proposed _folle journ e_ at Turin s, the colonel\nlaughed, got up noisily, and went away.",
      "Levin too rose, but he saw by\nthe face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go.",
      "He\nmust stay two minutes longer.",
      "He sat down.",
      "But as he was thinking all the while how stupid it was, he could not\nfind a subject for conversation, and sat silent.",
      "You are not going to the public meeting?",
      "They say it will be very\ninteresting,  began the countess.",
      "No, I promised my _belle-s ur_ to fetch her from it,  said Levin.",
      "A silence followed.",
      "The mother once more exchanged glances with a\ndaughter.",
      "Well, now I think the time has come,  thought Levin, and he got up.",
      "The ladies shook hands with him, and begged him to say _mille choses_\nto his wife for them.",
      "The porter asked him, as he gave him his coat,  Where is your honor\nstaying?",
      "and immediately wrote down his address in a big handsomely\nbound book.",
      "Of course I don t care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid, \nthought Levin, consoling himself with the reflection that everyone does\nit.",
      "He drove to the public meeting, where he was to find his\nsister-in-law, so as to drive home with her.",
      "At the public meeting of the committee there were a great many people,\nand almost all the highest society.",
      "Levin was in time for the report\nwhich, as everyone said, was very interesting.",
      "When the reading of the\nreport was over, people moved about, and Levin met Sviazhsky, who\ninvited him very pressingly to come that evening to a meeting of the\nSociety of Agriculture, where a celebrated lecture was to be delivered,\nand Stepan Arkadyevitch, who had only just come from the races, and\nmany other acquaintances; and Levin heard and uttered various\ncriticisms on the meeting, on the new fantasia, and on a public trial.",
      "But, probably from the mental fatigue he was beginning to feel, he made\na blunder in speaking of the trial, and this blunder he recalled\nseveral times with vexation.",
      "Speaking of the sentence upon a foreigner\nwho had been condemned in Russia, and of how unfair it would be to\npunish him by exile abroad, Levin repeated what he had heard the day\nbefore in conversation from an acquaintance.",
      "I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by\nputting it into the water,  said Levin.",
      "Then he recollected that this\nidea, which he had heard from an acquaintance and uttered as his own,\ncame from a fable of Krilov s, and that the acquaintance had picked it\nup from a newspaper article.",
      "After driving home with his sister-in-law, and finding Kitty in good\nspirits and quite well, Levin drove to the club.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nLevin reached the club just at the right time.",
      "Members and visitors\nwere driving up as he arrived.",
      "Levin had not been at the club for a\nvery long while not since he lived in Moscow, when he was leaving the\nuniversity and going into society.",
      "He remembered the club, the external\ndetails of its arrangement, but he had completely forgotten the\nimpression it had made on him in old days.",
      "But as soon as, driving into\nthe wide semicircular court and getting out of the sledge, he mounted\nthe steps, and the hall-porter, adorned with a crossway scarf,\nnoiselessly opened the door to him with a bow; as soon as he saw in the\nporter s room the cloaks and galoshes of members who thought it less\ntrouble to take them off downstairs; as soon as he heard the mysterious\nringing bell that preceded him as he ascended the easy, carpeted\nstaircase, and saw the statue on the landing, and the third porter at\nthe top doors, a familiar figure grown older, in the club livery,\nopening the door without haste or delay, and scanning the visitors as\nthey passed in Levin felt the old impression of the club come back in a\nrush, an impression of repose, comfort, and propriety.",
      "Your hat, please,  the porter said to Levin, who forgot the club rule\nto leave his hat in the porter s room.",
      "Long time since you ve been.",
      "The prince put your name down yesterday.",
      "Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is\nnot here yet.",
      "The porter did not only know Levin, but also all his ties and\nrelationships, and so immediately mentioned his intimate friends.",
      "Passing through the outer hall, divided up by screens, and the room\npartitioned on the right, where a man sits at the fruit buffet, Levin\novertook an old man walking slowly in, and entered the dining-room full\nof noise and people.",
      "He walked along the tables, almost all full, and looked at the\nvisitors.",
      "He saw people of all sorts, old and young; some he knew a\nlittle, some intimate friends.",
      "There was not a single cross or\nworried-looking face.",
      "All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties\nin the porter s room with their hats, and were all deliberately getting\nready to enjoy the material blessings of life.",
      "Sviazhsky was here and\nShtcherbatsky, Nevyedovsky and the old prince, and Vronsky and Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "Ah!",
      "why are you late?",
      "the prince said smiling, and giving him his\nhand over his own shoulder.",
      "How s Kitty?",
      "he added, smoothing out the\nnapkin he had tucked in at his waistcoat buttons.",
      "All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.",
      "Ah,  Aline-Nadine,  to be sure!",
      "There s no room with us.",
      "Go to that\ntable, and make haste and take a seat,  said the prince, and turning\naway he carefully took a plate of eel soup.",
      "Levin, this way!",
      "a good-natured voice shouted a little farther on.",
      "It\nwas Turovtsin.",
      "He was sitting with a young officer, and beside them\nwere two chairs turned upside down.",
      "Levin gladly went up to them.",
      "He\nhad always liked the good-hearted rake, Turovtsin he was associated in\nhis mind with memories of his courtship and at that moment, after the\nstrain of intellectual conversation, the sight of Turovtsin s\ngood-natured face was particularly welcome.",
      "For you and Oblonsky.",
      "He ll be here directly.",
      "The young man, holding himself very erect, with eyes forever twinkling\nwith enjoyment, was an officer from Petersburg, Gagin.",
      "Turovtsin\nintroduced them.",
      "Oblonsky s always late.",
      "Ah, here he is!",
      "Have you only just come?",
      "said Oblonsky, coming quickly towards them.",
      "Good day.",
      "Had some vodka?",
      "Well, come along then.",
      "Levin got up and went with him to the big table spread with spirits and\nappetizers of the most various kinds.",
      "One would have thought that out\nof two dozen delicacies one might find something to one s taste, but\nStepan Arkadyevitch asked for something special, and one of the\nliveried waiters standing by immediately brought what was required.",
      "They drank a wine-glassful and returned to their table.",
      "At once, while they were still at the soup, Gagin was served with\nchampagne, and told the waiter to fill four glasses.",
      "Levin did not\nrefuse the wine, and asked for a second bottle.",
      "He was very hungry, and\nate and drank with great enjoyment, and with still greater enjoyment\ntook part in the lively and simple conversation of his companions.",
      "Gagin, dropping his voice, told the last good story from Petersburg,\nand the story, though improper and stupid, was so ludicrous that Levin\nbroke into roars of laughter so loud that those near looked round.",
      "That s in the same style as,  that s a thing I can t endure!",
      "You know\nthe story?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Ah, that s exquisite!",
      "Another\nbottle,  he said to the waiter, and he began to relate his good story.",
      "Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him,  a little old\nwaiter interrupted Stepan Arkadyevitch, bringing two delicate glasses\nof sparkling champagne, and addressing Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with\nred mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling.",
      "Who s that?",
      "asked Levin.",
      "You met him once at my place, don t you remember?",
      "A good-natured\nfellow.",
      "Levin did the same as Stepan Arkadyevitch and took the glass.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch s anecdote too was very amusing.",
      "Levin told his\nstory, and that too was successful.",
      "Then they talked of horses, of the\nraces, of what they had been doing that day, and of how smartly\nVronsky s Atlas had won the first prize.",
      "Levin did not notice how the\ntime passed at dinner.",
      "Ah!",
      "and here they are!",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said towards the end of\ndinner, leaning over the back of his chair and holding out his hand to\nVronsky, who came up with a tall officer of the Guards.",
      "Vronsky s face\ntoo beamed with the look of good-humored enjoyment that was general in\nthe club.",
      "He propped his elbow playfully on Stepan Arkadyevitch s\nshoulder, whispering something to him, and he held out his hand to\nLevin with the same good-humored smile.",
      "Very glad to meet you,  he said.",
      "I looked out for you at the\nelection, but I was told you had gone away.",
      "Yes, I left the same day.",
      "We ve just been talking of your horse.",
      "I\ncongratulate you,  said Levin.",
      "It was very rapidly run.",
      "Yes; you ve race horses too, haven t you?",
      "No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.",
      "Where have you dined?",
      "asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "We were at the second table, behind the columns.",
      "We ve been celebrating his success,  said the tall colonel.",
      "It s his\nsecond Imperial prize.",
      "I wish I might have the luck at cards he has\nwith horses.",
      "Well, why waste the precious time?",
      "I m going to the\n infernal regions,  added the colonel, and he walked away.",
      "That s Yashvin,  Vronsky said in answer to Turovtsin, and he sat down\nin the vacated seat beside them.",
      "He drank the glass offered him, and\nordered a bottle of wine.",
      "Under the influence of the club atmosphere or\nthe wine he had drunk, Levin chatted away to Vronsky of the best breeds\nof cattle, and was very glad not to feel the slightest hostility to\nthis man.",
      "He even told him, among other things, that he had heard from\nhis wife that she had met him at Princess Marya Borissovna s.\n\n Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she s exquisite!",
      "said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, and he told an anecdote about her which set them all\nlaughing.",
      "Vronsky particularly laughed with such simplehearted\namusement that Levin felt quite reconciled to him.",
      "Well, have we finished?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, getting up with a\nsmile.",
      "Let us go.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nGetting up from the table, Levin walked with Gagin through the lofty\nroom to the billiard room, feeling his arms swing as he walked with a\npeculiar lightness and ease.",
      "As he crossed the big room, he came upon\nhis father-in-law.",
      "Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?",
      "said the prince,\ntaking his arm.",
      "Come along, come along!",
      "Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything.",
      "It s interesting.",
      "Yes, it s interesting for you.",
      "But its interest for me is quite\ndifferent.",
      "You look at those little old men now,  he said, pointing to\na club member with bent back and projecting lip, shuffling towards them\nin his soft boots,  and imagine that they were _shlupiks_ like that\nfrom their birth up.",
      "How _shlupiks_?",
      "I see you don t know that name.",
      "That s our club designation.",
      "You know\nthe game of rolling eggs: when one s rolled a long while it becomes a\n_shlupik_.",
      "So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club,\nand ends by becoming a _shlupik_.",
      "Ah, you laugh!",
      "but we look out, for\nfear of dropping into it ourselves.",
      "You know Prince Tchetchensky?",
      "inquired the prince; and Levin saw by his face that he was just going\nto relate something funny.",
      "No, I don t know him.",
      "You don t say so!",
      "Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure.",
      "No\nmatter, though.",
      "He s always playing billiards here.",
      "Only three years\nago he was not a _shlupik_ and kept up his spirits and even used to\ncall other people _shlupiks_.",
      "But one day he turns up, and our porter\n... you know Vassily?",
      "Why, that fat one; he s famous for his _bon\nmots_.",
      "And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him,  Come, Vassily, who s here?",
      "Any _shlupiks_ here yet?",
      "And he says,  You re the third.",
      "Yes, my dear\nboy, that he did!",
      "Talking and greeting the friends they met, Levin and the prince walked\nthrough all the rooms: the great room where tables had already been\nset, and the usual partners were playing for small stakes; the divan\nroom, where they were playing chess, and Sergey Ivanovitch was sitting\ntalking to somebody; the billiard room, where, about a sofa in a\nrecess, there was a lively party drinking champagne Gagin was one of\nthem.",
      "They peeped into the  infernal regions,  where a good many men\nwere crowding round one table, at which Yashvin was sitting.",
      "Trying not\nto make a noise, they walked into the dark reading room, where under\nthe shaded lamps there sat a young man with a wrathful countenance,\nturning over one journal after another, and a bald general buried in a\nbook.",
      "They went, too, into what the prince called the intellectual\nroom, where three gentlemen were engaged in a heated discussion of the\nlatest political news.",
      "Prince, please come, we re ready,  said one of his card party, who had\ncome to look for him, and the prince went off.",
      "Levin sat down and\nlistened, but recalling all the conversation of the morning he felt all\nof a sudden fearfully bored.",
      "He got up hurriedly, and went to look for\nOblonsky and Turovtsin, with whom it had been so pleasant.",
      "Turovtsin was one of the circle drinking in the billiard room, and\nStepan Arkadyevitch was talking with Vronsky near the door at the\nfarther corner of the room.",
      "It s not that she s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled\nposition,  Levin caught, and he was hurrying away, but Stepan\nArkadyevitch called to him.",
      "Levin,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, and Levin noticed that his eyes were\nnot full of tears exactly, but moist, which always happened when he had\nbeen drinking, or when he was touched.",
      "Just now it was due to both\ncauses.",
      "Levin, don t go,  he said, and he warmly squeezed his arm\nabove the elbow, obviously not at all wishing to let him go.",
      "This is a true friend of mine almost my greatest friend,  he said to\nVronsky.",
      "You have become even closer and dearer to me.",
      "And I want you,\nand I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you re\nboth splendid fellows.",
      "Well, there s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,  Vronsky\nsaid, with good-natured playfulness, holding out his hand.",
      "Levin quickly took the offered hand, and pressed it warmly.",
      "I m very, very glad,  said Levin.",
      "Waiter, a bottle of champagne,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "And I m very glad,  said Vronsky.",
      "But in spite of Stepan Arkadyevitch s desire, and their own desire,\nthey had nothing to talk about, and both felt it.",
      "Do you know, he has never met Anna?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch said to\nVronsky.",
      "And I want above everything to take him to see her.",
      "Let us\ngo, Levin!",
      "Really?",
      "said Vronsky.",
      "She will be very glad to see you.",
      "I should be\ngoing home at once,  he added,  but I m worried about Yashvin, and I\nwant to stay on till he finishes.",
      "Why, is he losing?",
      "He keeps losing, and I m the only friend that can restrain him.",
      "Well, what do you say to pyramids?",
      "Levin, will you play?",
      "Capital!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Get the table ready,  he said to the marker.",
      "It has been ready a long while,  answered the marker, who had already\nset the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his\nown diversion.",
      "Well, let us begin.",
      "After the game Vronsky and Levin sat down at Gagin s table, and at\nStepan Arkadyevitch s suggestion Levin took a hand in the game.",
      "Vronsky sat down at the table, surrounded by friends, who were\nincessantly coming up to him.",
      "Every now and then he went to the\n infernal  to keep an eye on Yashvin.",
      "Levin was enjoying a delightful\nsense of repose after the mental fatigue of the morning.",
      "He was glad\nthat all hostility was at an end with Vronsky, and the sense of peace,\ndecorum, and comfort never left him.",
      "When the game was over, Stepan Arkadyevitch took Levin s arm.",
      "Well, let us go to Anna s, then.",
      "At once?",
      "Eh?",
      "She is at home.",
      "I\npromised her long ago to bring you.",
      "Where were you meaning to spend the\nevening?",
      "Oh, nowhere specially.",
      "I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of\nAgriculture.",
      "By all means, let us go,  said Levin.",
      "Very good; come along.",
      "Find out if my carriage is here,  Stepan\nArkadyevitch said to the waiter.",
      "Levin went up to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost; paid\nhis bill, the amount of which was in some mysterious way ascertained by\nthe little old waiter who stood at the counter, and swinging his arms\nhe walked through all the rooms to the way out.",
      "Chapter 9\n\n Oblonsky s carriage!",
      "the porter shouted in an angry bass.",
      "The\ncarriage drove up and both got in.",
      "It was only for the first few\nmoments, while the carriage was driving out of the clubhouse gates,\nthat Levin was still under the influence of the club atmosphere of\nrepose, comfort, and unimpeachable good form.",
      "But as soon as the\ncarriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the\nuneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards\nthem, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the\nshops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his\nactions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna.",
      "What would Kitty say?",
      "But Stepan Arkadyevitch gave him no time for\nreflection, and, as though divining his doubts, he scattered them.",
      "How glad I am,  he said,  that you should know her!",
      "You know Dolly has\nlong wished for it.",
      "And Lvov s been to see her, and often goes.",
      "Though\nshe is my sister,  Stepan Arkadyevitch pursued,  I don t hesitate to\nsay that she s a remarkable woman.",
      "But you will see.",
      "Her position is\nvery painful, especially now.",
      "Why especially now?",
      "We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce.",
      "And\nhe s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the\nbusiness, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging\non for three months past.",
      "As soon as the divorce is over, she will\nmarry Vronsky.",
      "How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one\nbelieves in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch put in.",
      "Well, then their position will be as regular as\nmine, as yours.",
      "What is the difficulty?",
      "said Levin.",
      "Oh, it s a long and tedious story!",
      "The whole business is in such an\nanomalous position with us.",
      "But the point is she has been for three\nmonths in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce;\nshe goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you\nunderstand, she doesn t care to have people come as a favor.",
      "That fool\nPrincess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of\npropriety.",
      "Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not\nhave found resources in herself.",
      "But you ll see how she has arranged\nher life how calm, how dignified she is.",
      "To the left, in the crescent\nopposite the church!",
      "shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch, leaning out of the\nwindow.",
      "Phew!",
      "how hot it is!",
      "he said, in spite of twelve degrees of\nfrost, flinging his open overcoat still wider open.",
      "But she has a daughter: no doubt she s busy looking after her?",
      "said\nLevin.",
      "I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, _une couveuse,_ \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "If she s occupied, it must be with her\nchildren.",
      "No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one doesn t\nhear about her.",
      "She s busy, in the first place, with what she writes.",
      "I\nsee you re smiling ironically, but you re wrong.",
      "She s writing a\nchildren s book, and doesn t talk about it to anyone, but she read it\nto me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ... you know the publisher\n... and he s an author himself too, I fancy.",
      "He understands those\nthings, and he says it s a remarkable piece of work.",
      "But are you\nfancying she s an authoress?",
      "not a bit of it.",
      "She s a woman with a\nheart, before everything, but you ll see.",
      "Now she has a little English\ngirl with her, and a whole family she s looking after.",
      "Oh, something in a philanthropic way?",
      "Why, you will look at everything in the worst light.",
      "It s not from\nphilanthropy, it s from the heart.",
      "They that is, Vronsky had a trainer,\nan Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard.",
      "He s\ncompletely given up to drink delirium tremens and the family were cast\non the world.",
      "She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested\nin them, and now the whole family is on her hands.",
      "But not by way of\npatronage, you know, helping with money; she s herself preparing the\nboys in Russian for the high school, and she s taken the little girl to\nlive with her.",
      "But you ll see her for yourself.",
      "The carriage drove into the courtyard, and Stepan Arkadyevitch rang\nloudly at the entrance where sledges were standing.",
      "And without asking the servant who opened the door whether the lady\nwere at home, Stepan Arkadyevitch walked into the hall.",
      "Levin followed\nhim, more and more doubtful whether he was doing right or wrong.",
      "Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the\nface, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan\nArkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs.",
      "At the top Stepan Arkadyevitch\ninquired of the footman, who bowed to him as to an intimate friend, who\nwas with Anna Arkadyevna, and received the answer that it was M.\nVorkuev.",
      "Where are they?",
      "In the study.",
      "Passing through the dining-room, a room not very large, with dark,\npaneled walls, Stepan Arkadyevitch and Levin walked over the soft\ncarpet to the half-dark study, lighted up by a single lamp with a big\ndark shade.",
      "Another lamp with a reflector was hanging on the wall,\nlighting up a big full-length portrait of a woman, which Levin could\nnot help looking at.",
      "It was the portrait of Anna, painted in Italy by\nMihailov.",
      "While Stepan Arkadyevitch went behind the _treillage_, and\nthe man s voice which had been speaking paused, Levin gazed at the\nportrait, which stood out from the frame in the brilliant light thrown\non it, and he could not tear himself away from it.",
      "He positively forgot\nwhere he was, and not even hearing what was said, he could not take his\neyes off the marvelous portrait.",
      "It was not a picture, but a living,\ncharming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders,\nwith a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down; triumphantly\nand softly she looked at him with eyes that baffled him.",
      "She was not\nliving only because she was more beautiful than a living woman can be.",
      "I am delighted!",
      "He heard suddenly near him a voice, unmistakably\naddressing him, the voice of the very woman he had been admiring in the\nportrait.",
      "Anna had come from behind the _treillage_ to meet him, and\nLevin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait,\nin a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same\nexpression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had\ncaught in the portrait.",
      "She was less dazzling in reality, but, on the\nother hand, there was something fresh and seductive in the living woman\nwhich was not in the portrait.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nShe had risen to meet him, not concealing her pleasure at seeing him;\nand in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand,\nintroduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little\ngirl who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized\nand liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always\nself-possessed and natural.",
      "I am delighted, delighted,  she repeated, and on her lips these simple\nwords took for Levin s ears a special significance.",
      "I have known you\nand liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva\nand for your wife s sake....",
      "I knew her for a very short time, but she\nleft on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower.",
      "And\nto think she will soon be a mother!",
      "She spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from Levin to\nher brother, and Levin felt that the impression he was making was good,\nand he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though\nhe had known her from childhood.",
      "Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey s study,  she said in answer\nto Stepan Arkadyevitch s question whether he might smoke,  just so as\nto be able to smoke and glancing at Levin, instead of asking whether\nhe would smoke, she pulled closer a tortoise-shell cigar-case and took\na cigarette.",
      "How are you feeling today?",
      "her brother asked her.",
      "Oh, nothing.",
      "Nerves, as usual.",
      "Yes, isn t it extraordinarily fine?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nnoticing that Levin was scrutinizing the picture.",
      "I have never seen a better portrait.",
      "And extraordinarily like, isn t it?",
      "said Vorkuev.",
      "Levin looked from the portrait to the original.",
      "A peculiar brilliance\nlighted up Anna s face when she felt his eyes on her.",
      "Levin flushed,\nand to cover his confusion would have asked whether she had seen Darya\nAlexandrovna lately; but at that moment Anna spoke.",
      "We were just\ntalking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov s last pictures.",
      "Have\nyou seen them?",
      "Yes, I have seen them,  answered Levin.",
      "But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were saying?...",
      "Levin asked if she had seen Dolly lately.",
      "She was here yesterday.",
      "She was very indignant with the high school\npeople on Grisha s account.",
      "The Latin teacher, it seems, had been\nunfair to him.",
      "Yes, I have seen his pictures.",
      "I didn t care for them very much, \nLevin went back to the subject she had started.",
      "Levin talked now not at all with that purely businesslike attitude to\nthe subject with which he had been talking all the morning.",
      "Every word\nin his conversation with her had a special significance.",
      "And talking to\nher was pleasant; still pleasanter it was to listen to her.",
      "Anna talked not merely naturally and cleverly, but cleverly and\ncarelessly, attaching no value to her own ideas and giving great weight\nto the ideas of the person she was talking to.",
      "The conversation turned on the new movement in art, on the new\nillustrations of the Bible by a French artist.",
      "Vorkuev attacked the\nartist for a realism carried to the point of coarseness.",
      "Levin said that the French had carried conventionality further than\nanyone, and that consequently they see a great merit in the return to\nrealism.",
      "In the fact of not lying they see poetry.",
      "Never had anything clever said by Levin given him so much pleasure as\nthis remark.",
      "Anna s face lighted up at once, as at once she appreciated\nthe thought.",
      "She laughed.",
      "I laugh,  she said,  as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.",
      "What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and\nliterature too, indeed Zola, Daudet.",
      "But perhaps it is always so, that\nmen form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and\nthen all the _combinaisons_ made they are tired of the fictitious\nfigures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.",
      "That s perfectly true,  said Vorknev.",
      "So you ve been at the club?",
      "she said to her brother.",
      "Yes, yes, this is a woman!",
      "Levin thought, forgetting himself and\nstaring persistently at her lovely, mobile face, which at that moment\nwas all at once completely transformed.",
      "Levin did not hear what she was\ntalking of as she leaned over to her brother, but he was struck by the\nchange of her expression.",
      "Her face so handsome a moment before in its\nrepose suddenly wore a look of strange curiosity, anger, and pride.",
      "But\nthis lasted only an instant.",
      "She dropped her eyelids, as though\nrecollecting something.",
      "Oh, well, but that s of no interest to anyone,  she said, and she\nturned to the English girl.",
      "Please order the tea in the drawing-room,  she said in English.",
      "The girl got up and went out.",
      "Well, how did she get through her examination?",
      "asked Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "Splendidly!",
      "She s a very gifted child and a sweet character.",
      "It will end in your loving her more than your own.",
      "There a man speaks.",
      "In love there s no more nor less.",
      "I love my\ndaughter with one love, and her with another.",
      "I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,  said Vorkuev,  that if she were\nto put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl\nto the public question of the education of Russian children, she would\nbe doing a great and useful work.",
      "Yes, but I can t help it; I couldn t do it.",
      "Count Alexey Kirillovitch\nurged me very much  (as she uttered the words _Count Alexey\nKirillovitch_ she glanced with appealing timidity at Levin, and he\nunconsciously responded with a respectful and reassuring look);  he\nurged me to take up the school in the village.",
      "I visited it several\ntimes.",
      "The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the\nwork.",
      "You speak of energy.",
      "Energy rests upon love; and come as it will,\nthere s no forcing it.",
      "I took to this child I could not myself say\nwhy.",
      "And she glanced again at Levin.",
      "And her smile and her glance all told\nhim that it was to him only she was addressing her words, valuing his\ngood opinion, and at the same time sure beforehand that they understood\neach other.",
      "I quite understand that,  Levin answered.",
      "It s impossible to give\none s heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe\nthat s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor\nresults.",
      "She was silent for a while, then she smiled.",
      "Yes, yes,  she agreed;  I never could.",
      "_Je n ai pas le c ur assez_\nlarge to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls.",
      "_Cela ne m a\njamais r ussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une\nposition sociale_ in that way.",
      "And now more than ever,  she said with a\nmournful, confiding expression, ostensibly addressing her brother, but\nunmistakably intending her words only for Levin,  now when I have such\nneed of some occupation, I cannot.",
      "And suddenly frowning (Levin saw\nthat she was frowning at herself for talking about herself) she changed\nthe subject.",
      "I know about you,  she said to Levin;  that you re not a\npublic-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my\nability.",
      "How have you defended me?",
      "Oh, according to the attacks made on you.",
      "But won t you have some\ntea?",
      "She rose and took up a book bound in morocco.",
      "Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,  said Vorkuev, indicating the book.",
      "It s well worth taking up.",
      "Oh, no, it s all so sketchy.",
      "I told him about it,  Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his sister, nodding\nat Levin.",
      "You shouldn t have.",
      "My writing is something after the fashion of those\nlittle baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from\nthe prisons.",
      "She had the direction of the prison department in that\nsociety,  she turned to Levin;  and they were miracles of patience, the\nwork of those poor wretches.",
      "And Levin saw a new trait in this woman, who attracted him so\nextraordinarily.",
      "Besides wit, grace, and beauty, she had truth.",
      "She had\nno wish to hide from him all the bitterness of her position.",
      "As she\nsaid that she sighed, and her face suddenly taking a hard expression,\nlooked as it were turned to stone.",
      "With that expression on her face she\nwas more beautiful than ever; but the expression was new; it was\nutterly unlike that expression, radiant with happiness and creating\nhappiness, which had been caught by the painter in her portrait.",
      "Levin\nlooked more than once at the portrait and at her figure, as taking her\nbrother s arm she walked with him to the high doors and he felt for her\na tenderness and pity at which he wondered himself.",
      "She asked Levin and Vorkuev to go into the drawing-room, while she\nstayed behind to say a few words to her brother.",
      "About her divorce,\nabout Vronsky, and what he s doing at the club, about me?",
      "wondered\nLevin.",
      "And he was so keenly interested by the question of what she was\nsaying to Stepan Arkadyevitch, that he scarcely heard what Vorkuev was\ntelling him of the qualities of the story for children Anna Arkadyevna\nhad written.",
      "At tea the same pleasant sort of talk, full of interesting matter,\ncontinued.",
      "There was not a single instant when a subject for\nconversation was to seek; on the contrary, it was felt that one had\nhardly time to say what one had to say, and eagerly held back to hear\nwhat the others were saying.",
      "And all that was said, not only by her,\nbut by Vorkuev and Stepan Arkadyevitch all, so it seemed to Levin,\ngained peculiar significance from her appreciation and her criticism.",
      "While he followed this interesting conversation, Levin was all the time\nadmiring her her beauty, her intelligence, her culture, and at the same\ntime her directness and genuine depth of feeling.",
      "He listened and\ntalked, and all the while he was thinking of her inner life, trying to\ndivine her feelings.",
      "And though he had judged her so severely hitherto,\nnow by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her and was\nalso sorry for her, and afraid that Vronsky did not fully understand\nher.",
      "At eleven o clock, when Stepan Arkadyevitch got up to go (Vorkuev\nhad left earlier), it seemed to Levin that he had only just come.",
      "Regretfully Levin too rose.",
      "Good-bye,  she said, holding his hand and glancing into his face with\na winning look.",
      "I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._ \n\nShe dropped his hand, and half closed her eyes.",
      "Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot\npardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never\npardon it.",
      "To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through,\nand may God spare her that.",
      "Certainly, yes, I will tell her....  Levin said, blushing.",
      "Chapter 11\n\n What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!",
      "he was thinking, as he\nstepped out into the frosty air with Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Well, didn t I tell you?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, seeing that Levin\nhad been completely won over.",
      "Yes,  said Levin dreamily,  an extraordinary woman!",
      "It s not her\ncleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling.",
      "I m awfully\nsorry for her!",
      "Now, please God, everything will soon be settled.",
      "Well, well, don t be\nhard on people in future,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, opening the\ncarriage door.",
      "Good-bye; we don t go the same way.",
      "Still thinking of Anna, of everything, even the simplest phrase in\ntheir conversation with her, and recalling the minutest changes in her\nexpression, entering more and more into her position, and feeling\nsympathy for her, Levin reached home.",
      "At home Kouzma told Levin that Katerina Alexandrovna was quite well,\nand that her sisters had not long been gone, and he handed him two\nletters.",
      "Levin read them at once in the hall, that he might not\noverlook them later.",
      "One was from Sokolov, his bailiff.",
      "Sokolov wrote\nthat the corn could not be sold, that it was fetching only five and a\nhalf roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it.",
      "The\nother letter was from his sister.",
      "She scolded him for her business\nbeing still unsettled.",
      "Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can t get more,  Levin\ndecided the first question, which had always before seemed such a\nweighty one, with extraordinary facility on the spot.",
      "It s\nextraordinary how all one s time is taken up here,  he thought,\nconsidering the second letter.",
      "He felt himself to blame for not having\ngot done what his sister had asked him to do for her.",
      "Today, again,\nI ve not been to the court, but today I ve certainly not had time.",
      "And\nresolving that he would not fail to do it next day, he went up to his\nwife.",
      "As he went in, Levin rapidly ran through mentally the day he had\nspent.",
      "All the events of the day were conversations, conversations he\nhad heard and taken part in.",
      "All the conversations were upon subjects\nwhich, if he had been alone at home, he would never have taken up, but\nhere they were very interesting.",
      "And all these conversations were right\nenough, only in two places there was something not quite right.",
      "One was\nwhat he had said about the carp, the other was something not  quite the\nthing  in the tender sympathy he was feeling for Anna.",
      "Levin found his wife low-spirited and dull.",
      "The dinner of the three\nsisters had gone off very well, but then they had waited and waited for\nhim, all of them had felt dull, the sisters had departed, and she had\nbeen left alone.",
      "Well, and what have you been doing?",
      "she asked him, looking straight\ninto his eyes, which shone with rather a suspicious brightness.",
      "But\nthat she might not prevent his telling her everything, she concealed\nher close scrutiny of him, and with an approving smile listened to his\naccount of how he had spent the evening.",
      "Well, I m very glad I met Vronsky.",
      "I felt quite at ease and natural\nwith him.",
      "You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I m glad that\nthis awkwardness is all over,  he said, and remembering that by way of\ntrying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on Anna, he\nblushed.",
      "We talk about the peasants drinking; I don t know which\ndrinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on\nholidays, but....",
      "But Kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking\nhabits of the peasants.",
      "She saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know\nwhy.",
      "Well, and then where did you go?",
      "Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.",
      "And as he said this, Levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to\nwhether he had done right in going to see Anna were settled once for\nall.",
      "He knew now that he ought not to have done so.",
      "Kitty s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at Anna s name, but\ncontrolling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and\ndeceived him.",
      "Oh!",
      "was all she said.",
      "I m sure you won t be angry at my going.",
      "Stiva begged me to, and Dolly\nwished it,  Levin went on.",
      "Oh, no!",
      "she said, but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him\nno good.",
      "She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,  he said, telling\nher about Anna, her occupations, and what she had told him to say to\nher.",
      "Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,  said Kitty, when he\nhad finished.",
      "Whom was your letter from?",
      "He told her, and believing in her calm tone, he went to change his\ncoat.",
      "Coming back, he found Kitty in the same easy chair.",
      "When he went up to\nher, she glanced at him and broke into sobs.",
      "What?",
      "what is it?",
      "he asked, knowing beforehand what.",
      "You re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you!",
      "I saw\nit in your eyes.",
      "Yes, yes!",
      "What can it all lead to?",
      "You were drinking\nat the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to her of all\npeople!",
      "No, we must go away....",
      "I shall go away tomorrow.",
      "It was a long while before Levin could soothe his wife.",
      "At last he\nsucceeded in calming her, only by confessing that a feeling of pity, in\nconjunction with the wine he had drunk, had been too much for him, that\nhe had succumbed to Anna s artful influence, and that he would avoid\nher.",
      "One thing he did with more sincerity confess to was that living so\nlong in Moscow, a life of nothing but conversation, eating and\ndrinking, he was degenerating.",
      "They talked till three o clock in the\nmorning.",
      "Only at three o clock were they sufficiently reconciled to be\nable to go to sleep.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nAfter taking leave of her guests, Anna did not sit down, but began\nwalking up and down the room.",
      "She had unconsciously the whole evening\ndone her utmost to arouse in Levin a feeling of love as of late she had\nfallen into doing with all young men and she knew she had attained her\naim, as far as was possible in one evening, with a married and\nconscientious man.",
      "She liked him indeed extremely, and, in spite of the\nstriking difference, from the masculine point of view, between Vronsky\nand Levin, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had\nmade Kitty able to love both.",
      "Yet as soon as he was out of the room,\nshe ceased to think of him.",
      "One thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused\nto be shaken off.",
      "If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who\nloves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?...",
      "not\ncold exactly, he loves me, I know that!",
      "But something new is drawing us\napart now.",
      "Why wasn t he here all the evening?",
      "He told Stiva to say he\ncould not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play.",
      "Is Yashvin a\nchild?",
      "But supposing it s true.",
      "He never tells a lie.",
      "But there s\nsomething else in it if it s true.",
      "He is glad of an opportunity of\nshowing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that.",
      "But\nwhy prove that to me?",
      "He wants to show me that his love for me is not\nto interfere with his freedom.",
      "But I need no proofs, I need love.",
      "He\nought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in\nMoscow.",
      "Is this life?",
      "I am not living, but waiting for an event, which\nis continually put off and put off.",
      "No answer again!",
      "And Stiva says he\ncannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "And I can t write again.",
      "I can do\nnothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I\nwait, inventing amusements for myself the English family, writing,\nreading but it s all nothing but a sham, it s all the same as morphine.",
      "He ought to feel for me,  she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming\ninto her eyes.",
      "She heard Vronsky s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tears not only\ndried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and opened a book, affecting\ncomposure.",
      "She wanted to show him that she was displeased that he had\nnot come home as he had promised displeased only, and not on any\naccount to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity.",
      "She might pity herself, but he must not pity her.",
      "She did not want\nstrife, she blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put\nherself into an attitude of antagonism.",
      "Well, you ve not been dull?",
      "he said, eagerly and good-humoredly,\ngoing up to her.",
      "What a terrible passion it is gambling!",
      "No, I ve not been dull; I ve learned long ago not to be dull.",
      "Stiva\nhas been here and Levin.",
      "Yes, they meant to come and see you.",
      "Well, how did you like Levin?",
      "he\nsaid, sitting down beside her.",
      "Very much.",
      "They have not long been gone.",
      "What was Yashvin doing?",
      "He was winning seventeen thousand.",
      "I got him away.",
      "He had really\nstarted home, but he went back again, and now he s losing.",
      "Then what did you stay for?",
      "she asked, suddenly lifting her eyes to\nhim.",
      "The expression of her face was cold and ungracious.",
      "You told\nStiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away.",
      "And you have left him\nthere.",
      "The same expression of cold readiness for the conflict appeared on his\nface too.",
      "In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; and\nsecondly, I never tell lies.",
      "But what s the chief point, I wanted to\nstay, and I stayed,  he said, frowning.",
      "Anna, what is it for, why will\nyou?",
      "he said after a moment s silence, bending over towards her, and\nhe opened his hand, hoping she would lay hers in it.",
      "She was glad of this appeal for tenderness.",
      "But some strange force of\nevil would not let her give herself up to her feelings, as though the\nrules of warfare would not permit her to surrender.",
      "Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed.",
      "You do everything you\nwant to.",
      "But what do you tell me that for?",
      "With what object?",
      "she said,\ngetting more and more excited.",
      "Does anyone contest your rights?",
      "But\nyou want to be right, and you re welcome to be right.",
      "His hand closed, he turned away, and his face wore a still more\nobstinate expression.",
      "For you it s a matter of obstinacy,  she said, watching him intently\nand suddenly finding the right word for that expression that irritated\nher,  simply obstinacy.",
      "For you it s a question of whether you keep the\nupper hand of me, while for me....  Again she felt sorry for herself,\nand she almost burst into tears.",
      "If you knew what it is for me!",
      "When I\nfeel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew\nwhat this means for me!",
      "If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity\nat this instant, how afraid I am of myself!",
      "And she turned away,\nhiding her sobs.",
      "But what are you talking about?",
      "he said, horrified at her expression\nof despair, and again bending over her, he took her hand and kissed it.",
      "What is it for?",
      "Do I seek amusements outside our home?",
      "Don t I avoid\nthe society of women?",
      "Well, yes!",
      "If that were all!",
      "she said.",
      "Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind?",
      "I am ready\nto do anything to make you happy,  he said, touched by her expression\nof despair;  what wouldn t I do to save you from distress of any sort,\nas now, Anna!",
      "he said.",
      "It s nothing, nothing!",
      "she said.",
      "I don t know myself whether it s\nthe solitary life, my nerves.... Come, don t let us talk of it.",
      "What\nabout the race?",
      "You haven t told me!",
      "she inquired, trying to conceal\nher triumph at the victory, which had anyway been on her side.",
      "He asked for supper, and began telling her about the races; but in his\ntone, in his eyes, which became more and more cold, she saw that he did\nnot forgive her for her victory, that the feeling of obstinacy with\nwhich she had been struggling had asserted itself again in him.",
      "He was\ncolder to her than before, as though he were regretting his surrender.",
      "And she, remembering the words that had given her the victory,  how I\nfeel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself,  saw that\nthis weapon was a dangerous one, and that it could not be used a second\ntime.",
      "And she felt that beside the love that bound them together there\nhad grown up between them some evil spirit of strife, which she could\nnot exorcise from his, and still less from her own heart.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nThere are no conditions to which a man cannot become used, especially\nif he sees that all around him are living in the same way.",
      "Levin could\nnot have believed three months before that he could have gone quietly\nto sleep in the condition in which he was that day, that leading an\naimless, irrational life, living too beyond his means, after drinking\nto excess (he could not call what happened at the club anything else),\nforming inappropriately friendly relations with a man with whom his\nwife had once been in love, and a still more inappropriate call upon a\nwoman who could only be called a lost woman, after being fascinated by\nthat woman and causing his wife distress he could still go quietly to\nsleep.",
      "But under the influence of fatigue, a sleepless night, and the\nwine he had drunk, his sleep was sound and untroubled.",
      "At five o clock the creak of a door opening waked him.",
      "He jumped up and\nlooked round.",
      "Kitty was not in bed beside him.",
      "But there was a light\nmoving behind the screen, and he heard her steps.",
      "What is it?...",
      "what is it?",
      "he said, half-asleep.",
      "Kitty!",
      "What is it?",
      "Nothing,  she said, coming from behind the screen with a candle in her\nhand.",
      "I felt unwell,  she said, smiling a particularly sweet and\nmeaning smile.",
      "What?",
      "has it begun?",
      "he said in terror.",
      "We ought to send....  and\nhurriedly he reached after his clothes.",
      "No, no,  she said, smiling and holding his hand.",
      "It s sure to be\nnothing.",
      "I was rather unwell, only a little.",
      "It s all over now.",
      "And getting into bed, she blew out the candle, lay down and was still.",
      "Though he thought her stillness suspicious, as though she were holding\nher breath, and still more suspicious the expression of peculiar\ntenderness and excitement with which, as she came from behind the\nscreen, she said  nothing,  he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at\nonce.",
      "Only later he remembered the stillness of her breathing, and\nunderstood all that must have been passing in her sweet, precious heart\nwhile she lay beside him, not stirring, in anticipation of the greatest\nevent in a woman s life.",
      "At seven o clock he was waked by the touch of\nher hand on his shoulder, and a gentle whisper.",
      "She seemed struggling\nbetween regret at waking him, and the desire to talk to him.",
      "Kostya, don t be frightened.",
      "It s all right.",
      "But I fancy.... We ought\nto send for Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "The candle was lighted again.",
      "She was sitting up in bed, holding some\nknitting, which she had been busy upon during the last few days.",
      "Please, don t be frightened, it s all right.",
      "I m not a bit afraid, \nshe said, seeing his scared face, and she pressed his hand to her bosom\nand then to her lips.",
      "He hurriedly jumped up, hardly awake, and kept his eyes fixed on her,\nas he put on his dressing gown; then he stopped, still looking at her.",
      "He had to go, but he could not tear himself from her eyes.",
      "He thought\nhe loved her face, knew her expression, her eyes, but never had he seen\nit like this.",
      "How hateful and horrible he seemed to himself, thinking\nof the distress he had caused her yesterday.",
      "Her flushed face, fringed\nwith soft curling hair under her night cap, was radiant with joy and\ncourage.",
      "Though there was so little that was complex or artificial in Kitty s\ncharacter in general, Levin was struck by what was revealed now, when\nsuddenly all disguises were thrown off and the very kernel of her soul\nshone in her eyes.",
      "And in this simplicity and nakedness of her soul,\nshe, the very woman he loved in her, was more manifest than ever.",
      "She\nlooked at him, smiling; but all at once her brows twitched, she threw\nup her head, and going quickly up to him, clutched his hand and pressed\nclose up to him, breathing her hot breath upon him.",
      "She was in pain and\nwas, as it were, complaining to him of her suffering.",
      "And for the first\nminute, from habit, it seemed to him that he was to blame.",
      "But in her\neyes there was a tenderness that told him that she was far from\nreproaching him, that she loved him for her sufferings.",
      "If not I, who\nis to blame for it?",
      "he thought unconsciously, seeking someone\nresponsible for this suffering for him to punish; but there was no one\nresponsible.",
      "She was suffering, complaining, and triumphing in her\nsufferings, and rejoicing in them, and loving them.",
      "He saw that\nsomething sublime was being accomplished in her soul, but what?",
      "He\ncould not make it out.",
      "It was beyond his understanding.",
      "I have sent to mamma.",
      "You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...",
      "Kostya!...",
      "Nothing, it s over.",
      "She moved away from him and rang the bell.",
      "Well, go now; Pasha s coming.",
      "I am all right.",
      "And Levin saw with astonishment that she had taken up the knitting she\nhad brought in in the night and begun working at it again.",
      "As Levin was going out of one door, he heard the maid-servant come in\nat the other.",
      "He stood at the door and heard Kitty giving exact\ndirections to the maid, and beginning to help her move the bedstead.",
      "He dressed, and while they were putting in his horses, as a hired\nsledge was not to be seen yet, he ran again up to the bedroom, not on\ntiptoe, it seemed to him, but on wings.",
      "Two maid-servants were\ncarefully moving something in the bedroom.",
      "Kitty was walking about knitting rapidly and giving directions.",
      "I m going for the doctor.",
      "They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but\nI ll go on there too.",
      "Isn t there anything wanted?",
      "Yes, shall I go to\nDolly s?",
      "She looked at him, obviously not hearing what he was saying.",
      "Yes, yes.",
      "Do go,  she said quickly, frowning and waving her hand to\nhim.",
      "He had just gone into the drawing-room, when suddenly a plaintive moan\nsounded from the bedroom, smothered instantly.",
      "He stood still, and for\na long while he could not understand.",
      "Yes, that is she,  he said to himself, and clutching at his head he\nran downstairs.",
      "Lord have mercy on us!",
      "pardon us!",
      "aid us!",
      "he repeated the words that\nfor some reason came suddenly to his lips.",
      "And he, an unbeliever,\nrepeated these words not with his lips only.",
      "At that instant he knew\nthat all his doubts, even the impossibility of believing with his\nreason, of which he was aware in himself, did not in the least hinder\nhis turning to God.",
      "All of that now floated out of his soul like dust.",
      "To whom was he to turn if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself,\nhis soul, and his love?",
      "The horse was not yet ready, but feeling a peculiar concentration of\nhis physical forces and his intellect on what he had to do, he started\noff on foot without waiting for the horse, and told Kouzma to overtake\nhim.",
      "At the corner he met a night cabman driving hurriedly.",
      "In the little\nsledge, wrapped in a velvet cloak, sat Lizaveta Petrovna with a\nkerchief round her head.",
      "Thank God!",
      "thank God!",
      "he said, overjoyed to\nrecognize her little fair face which wore a peculiarly serious, even\nstern expression.",
      "Telling the driver not to stop, he ran along beside\nher.",
      "For two hours, then?",
      "Not more?",
      "she inquired.",
      "You should let Pyotr\nDmitrievitch know, but don t hurry him.",
      "And get some opium at the\nchemist s. \n\n So you think that it may go on well?",
      "Lord have mercy on us and help\nus!",
      "Levin said, seeing his own horse driving out of the gate.",
      "Jumping\ninto the sledge beside Kouzma, he told him to drive to the doctor s.\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nThe doctor was not yet up, and the footman said that  he had been up\nlate, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.",
      "The\nfootman was cleaning the lamp-chimneys, and seemed very busy about\nthem.",
      "This concentration of the footman upon his lamps, and his\nindifference to what was passing in Levin, at first astounded him, but\nimmediately on considering the question he realized that no one knew or\nwas bound to know his feelings, and that it was all the more necessary\nto act calmly, sensibly, and resolutely to get through this wall of\nindifference and attain his aim.",
      "Don t be in a hurry or let anything slip,  Levin said to himself,\nfeeling a greater and greater flow of physical energy and attention to\nall that lay before him to do.",
      "Having ascertained that the doctor was not getting up, Levin considered\nvarious plans, and decided on the following one: that Kouzma should go\nfor another doctor, while he himself should go to the chemist s for\nopium, and if when he came back the doctor had not yet begun to get up,\nhe would either by tipping the footman, or by force, wake the doctor at\nall hazards.",
      "At the chemist s the lank shopman sealed up a packet of powders for a\ncoachman who stood waiting, and refused him opium with the same\ncallousness with which the doctor s footman had cleaned his lamp\nchimneys.",
      "Trying not to get flurried or out of temper, Levin mentioned\nthe names of the doctor and midwife, and explaining what the opium was\nneeded for, tried to persuade him.",
      "The assistant inquired in German\nwhether he should give it, and receiving an affirmative reply from\nbehind the partition, he took out a bottle and a funnel, deliberately\npoured the opium from a bigger bottle into a little one, stuck on a\nlabel, sealed it up, in spite of Levin s request that he would not do\nso, and was about to wrap it up too.",
      "This was more than Levin could\nstand; he took the bottle firmly out of his hands, and ran to the big\nglass doors.",
      "The doctor was not even now getting up, and the footman,\nbusy now in putting down the rugs, refused to wake him.",
      "Levin\ndeliberately took out a ten rouble note, and, careful to speak slowly,\nthough losing no time over the business, he handed him the note, and\nexplained that Pyotr Dmitrievitch (what a great and important personage\nhe seemed to Levin now, this Pyotr Dmitrievitch, who had been of so\nlittle consequence in his eyes before!)",
      "had promised to come at any\ntime; that he would certainly not be angry!",
      "and that he must therefore\nwake him at once.",
      "The footman agreed, and went upstairs, taking Levin into the waiting\nroom.",
      "Levin could hear through the door the doctor coughing, moving about,\nwashing, and saying something.",
      "Three minutes passed; it seemed to Levin\nthat more than an hour had gone by.",
      "He could not wait any longer.",
      "Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!",
      "he said in an imploring voice\nat the open door.",
      "For God s sake, forgive me!",
      "See me as you are.",
      "It s\nbeen going on more than two hours already.",
      "In a minute; in a minute!",
      "answered a voice, and to his amazement\nLevin heard that the doctor was smiling as he spoke.",
      "For one instant.",
      "In a minute.",
      "Two minutes more passed while the doctor was putting on his boots, and\ntwo minutes more while the doctor put on his coat and combed his hair.",
      "Pyotr Dmitrievitch!",
      "Levin was beginning again in a plaintive voice,\njust as the doctor came in dressed and ready.",
      "These people have no\nconscience,  thought Levin.",
      "Combing his hair, while we re dying!",
      "Good morning!",
      "the doctor said to him, shaking hands, and, as it were,\nteasing him with his composure.",
      "There s no hurry.",
      "Well now?",
      "Trying to be as accurate as possible, Levin began to tell him every\nunnecessary detail of his wife s condition, interrupting his account\nrepeatedly with entreaties that the doctor would come with him at once.",
      "Oh, you needn t be in any hurry.",
      "You don t understand, you know.",
      "I m\ncertain I m not wanted, still I ve promised, and if you like, I ll\ncome.",
      "But there s no hurry.",
      "Please sit down; won t you have some\ncoffee?",
      "Levin stared at him with eyes that asked whether he was laughing at\nhim; but the doctor had no notion of making fun of him.",
      "I know, I know,  the doctor said, smiling;  I m a married man myself;\nand at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied.",
      "I ve a\npatient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such\noccasions.",
      "But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch?",
      "Do you suppose it may go\nall right?",
      "Everything points to a favorable issue.",
      "So you ll come immediately?",
      "said Levin, looking wrathfully at the\nservant who was bringing in the coffee.",
      "In an hour s time.",
      "Oh, for mercy s sake!",
      "Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.",
      "The doctor started upon his coffee.",
      "Both were silent.",
      "The Turks are really getting beaten, though.",
      "Did you read yesterday s\ntelegrams?",
      "said the doctor, munching some roll.",
      "No, I can t stand it!",
      "said Levin, jumping up.",
      "So you ll be with us\nin a quarter of an hour.",
      "In half an hour.",
      "On your honor?",
      "When Levin got home, he drove up at the same time as the princess, and\nthey went up to the bedroom door together.",
      "The princess had tears in\nher eyes, and her hands were shaking.",
      "Seeing Levin, she embraced him,\nand burst into tears.",
      "Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?",
      "she queried, clasping the hand of\nthe midwife, who came out to meet them with a beaming and anxious face.",
      "She s going on well,  she said;  persuade her to lie down.",
      "She will be\neasier so.",
      "From the moment when he had waked up and understood what was going on,\nLevin had prepared his mind to bear resolutely what was before him, and\nwithout considering or anticipating anything, to avoid upsetting his\nwife, and on the contrary to soothe her and keep up her courage.",
      "Without allowing himself even to think of what was to come, of how it\nwould end, judging from his inquiries as to the usual duration of these\nordeals, Levin had in his imagination braced himself to bear up and to\nkeep a tight rein on his feelings for five hours, and it had seemed to\nhim he could do this.",
      "But when he came back from the doctor s and saw\nher sufferings again, he fell to repeating more and more frequently:\n Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!",
      "He sighed, and flung his head\nup, and began to feel afraid he could not bear it, that he would burst\ninto tears or run away.",
      "Such agony it was to him.",
      "And only one hour had\npassed.",
      "But after that hour there passed another hour, two hours, three, the\nfull five hours he had fixed as the furthest limit of his sufferings,\nand the position was still unchanged; and he was still bearing it\nbecause there was nothing to be done but bear it; every instant feeling\nthat he had reached the utmost limits of his endurance, and that his\nheart would break with sympathy and pain.",
      "But still the minutes passed by and the hours, and still hours more,\nand his misery and horror grew and were more and more intense.",
      "All the ordinary conditions of life, without which one can form no\nconception of anything, had ceased to exist for Levin.",
      "He lost all\nsense of time.",
      "Minutes those minutes when she sent for him and he held\nher moist hand, that would squeeze his hand with extraordinary violence\nand then push it away seemed to him hours, and hours seemed to him\nminutes.",
      "He was surprised when Lizaveta Petrovna asked him to light a\ncandle behind a screen, and he found that it was five o clock in the\nafternoon.",
      "If he had been told it was only ten o clock in the morning,\nhe would not have been more surprised.",
      "Where he was all this time, he\nknew as little as the time of anything.",
      "He saw her swollen face,\nsometimes bewildered and in agony, sometimes smiling and trying to\nreassure him.",
      "He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought,\nwith her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her\ntears, biting her lips; he saw Dolly too and the doctor, smoking fat\ncigarettes, and Lizaveta Petrovna with a firm, resolute, reassuring\nface, and the old prince walking up and down the hall with a frowning\nface.",
      "But why they came in and went out, where they were, he did not\nknow.",
      "The princess was with the doctor in the bedroom, then in the\nstudy, where a table set for dinner suddenly appeared; then she was not\nthere, but Dolly was.",
      "Then Levin remembered he had been sent somewhere.",
      "Once he had been sent to move a table and sofa.",
      "He had done this\neagerly, thinking it had to be done for her sake, and only later on he\nfound it was his own bed he had been getting ready.",
      "Then he had been\nsent to the study to ask the doctor something.",
      "The doctor had answered\nand then had said something about the irregularities in the municipal\ncouncil.",
      "Then he had been sent to the bedroom to help the old princess\nto move the holy picture in its silver and gold setting, and with the\nprincess s old waiting maid he had clambered on a shelf to reach it and\nhad broken the little lamp, and the old servant had tried to reassure\nhim about the lamp and about his wife, and he carried the holy picture\nand set it at Kitty s head, carefully tucking it in behind the pillow.",
      "But where, when, and why all this had happened, he could not tell.",
      "He\ndid not understand why the old princess took his hand, and looking\ncompassionately at him, begged him not to worry himself, and Dolly\npersuaded him to eat something and led him out of the room, and even\nthe doctor looked seriously and with commiseration at him and offered\nhim a drop of something.",
      "All he knew and felt was that what was happening was what had happened\nnearly a year before in the hotel of the country town at the deathbed\nof his brother Nikolay.",
      "But that had been grief this was joy.",
      "Yet that\ngrief and this joy were alike outside all the ordinary conditions of\nlife; they were loop-holes, as it were, in that ordinary life through\nwhich there came glimpses of something sublime.",
      "And in the\ncontemplation of this sublime something the soul was exalted to\ninconceivable heights of which it had before had no conception, while\nreason lagged behind, unable to keep up with it.",
      "Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!",
      "he repeated to himself\nincessantly, feeling, in spite of his long and, as it seemed, complete\nalienation from religion, that he turned to God just as trustfully and\nsimply as he had in his childhood and first youth.",
      "All this time he had two distinct spiritual conditions.",
      "One was away\nfrom her, with the doctor, who kept smoking one fat cigarette after\nanother and extinguishing them on the edge of a full ashtray, with\nDolly, and with the old prince, where there was talk about dinner,\nabout politics, about Marya Petrovna s illness, and where Levin\nsuddenly forgot for a minute what was happening, and felt as though he\nhad waked up from sleep; the other was in her presence, at her pillow,\nwhere his heart seemed breaking and still did not break from\nsympathetic suffering, and he prayed to God without ceasing.",
      "And every\ntime he was brought back from a moment of oblivion by a scream reaching\nhim from the bedroom, he fell into the same strange terror that had\ncome upon him the first minute.",
      "Every time he heard a shriek, he jumped\nup, ran to justify himself, remembered on the way that he was not to\nblame, and he longed to defend her, to help her.",
      "But as he looked at\nher, he saw again that help was impossible, and he was filled with\nterror and prayed:  Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!",
      "And as time\nwent on, both these conditions became more intense; the calmer he\nbecame away from her, completely forgetting her, the more agonizing\nbecame both her sufferings and his feeling of helplessness before them.",
      "He jumped up, would have liked to run away, but ran to her.",
      "Sometimes, when again and again she called upon him, he blamed her; but\nseeing her patient, smiling face, and hearing the words,  I am worrying\nyou,  he threw the blame on God; but thinking of God, at once he fell\nto beseeching God to forgive him and have mercy.",
      "Chapter 15\n\nHe did not know whether it was late or early.",
      "The candles had all\nburned out.",
      "Dolly had just been in the study and had suggested to the\ndoctor that he should lie down.",
      "Levin sat listening to the doctor s\nstories of a quack mesmerizer and looking at the ashes of his\ncigarette.",
      "There had been a period of repose, and he had sunk into\noblivion.",
      "He had completely forgotten what was going on now.",
      "He heard\nthe doctor s chat and understood it.",
      "Suddenly there came an unearthly\nshriek.",
      "The shriek was so awful that Levin did not even jump up, but\nholding his breath, gazed in terrified inquiry at the doctor.",
      "The\ndoctor put his head on one side, listened, and smiled approvingly.",
      "Everything was so extraordinary that nothing could strike Levin as\nstrange.",
      "I suppose it must be so,  he thought, and still sat where he\nwas.",
      "Whose scream was this?",
      "He jumped up, ran on tiptoe to the bedroom,\nedged round Lizaveta Petrovna and the princess, and took up his\nposition at Kitty s pillow.",
      "The scream had subsided, but there was some\nchange now.",
      "What it was he did not see and did not comprehend, and he\nhad no wish to see or comprehend.",
      "But he saw it by the face of Lizaveta\nPetrovna.",
      "Lizaveta Petrovna s face was stern and pale, and still as\nresolute, though her jaws were twitching, and her eyes were fixed\nintently on Kitty.",
      "Kitty s swollen and agonized face, a tress of hair\nclinging to her moist brow, was turned to him and sought his eyes.",
      "Her\nlifted hands asked for his hands.",
      "Clutching his chill hands in her\nmoist ones, she began squeezing them to her face.",
      "Don t go, don t go!",
      "I m not afraid, I m not afraid!",
      "she said rapidly.",
      "Mamma, take my earrings.",
      "They bother me.",
      "You re not afraid?",
      "Quick,\nquick, Lizaveta Petrovna.... \n\nShe spoke quickly, very quickly, and tried to smile.",
      "But suddenly her\nface was drawn, she pushed him away.",
      "Oh, this is awful!",
      "I m dying, I m dying!",
      "Go away!",
      "she shrieked, and\nagain he heard that unearthly scream.",
      "Levin clutched at his head and ran out of the room.",
      "It s nothing, it s nothing, it s all right,  Dolly called after him.",
      "But they might say what they liked, he knew now that all was over.",
      "He\nstood in the next room, his head leaning against the door post, and\nheard shrieks, howls such as he had never heard before, and he knew\nthat what had been Kitty was uttering these shrieks.",
      "He had long ago\nceased to wish for the child.",
      "By now he loathed this child.",
      "He did not\neven wish for her life now, all he longed for was the end of this awful\nanguish.",
      "Doctor!",
      "What is it?",
      "What is it?",
      "By God!",
      "he said, snatching at the\ndoctor s hand as he came up.",
      "It s the end,  said the doctor.",
      "And the doctor s face was so grave as\nhe said it that Levin took _the end_ as meaning her death.",
      "Beside himself, he ran into the bedroom.",
      "The first thing he saw was the\nface of Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "It was even more frowning and stern.",
      "Kitty s\nface he did not know.",
      "In the place where it had been was something that\nwas fearful in its strained distortion and in the sounds that came from\nit.",
      "He fell down with his head on the wooden framework of the bed,\nfeeling that his heart was bursting.",
      "The awful scream never paused, it\nbecame still more awful, and as though it had reached the utmost limit\nof terror, suddenly it ceased.",
      "Levin could not believe his ears, but\nthere could be no doubt; the scream had ceased and he heard a subdued\nstir and bustle, and hurried breathing, and her voice, gasping, alive,\ntender, and blissful, uttered softly,  It s over!",
      "He lifted his head.",
      "With her hands hanging exhausted on the quilt,\nlooking extraordinarily lovely and serene, she looked at him in silence\nand tried to smile, and could not.",
      "And suddenly, from the mysterious and awful far-away world in which he\nhad been living for the last twenty-two hours, Levin felt himself all\nin an instant borne back to the old every-day world, glorified though\nnow, by such a radiance of happiness that he could not bear it.",
      "The\nstrained chords snapped, sobs and tears of joy which he had never\nforeseen rose up with such violence that his whole body shook, that for\nlong they prevented him from speaking.",
      "Falling on his knees before the bed, he held his wife s hand before his\nlips and kissed it, and the hand, with a weak movement of the fingers,\nresponded to his kiss.",
      "And meanwhile, there at the foot of the bed, in\nthe deft hands of Lizaveta Petrovna, like a flickering light in a lamp,\nlay the life of a human creature, which had never existed before, and\nwhich would now with the same right, with the same importance to\nitself, live and create in its own image.",
      "Alive!",
      "alive!",
      "And a boy too!",
      "Set your mind at rest!",
      "Levin heard\nLizaveta Petrovna saying, as she slapped the baby s back with a shaking\nhand.",
      "Mamma, is it true?",
      "said Kitty s voice.",
      "The princess s sobs were all the answers she could make.",
      "And in the\nmidst of the silence there came in unmistakable reply to the mother s\nquestion, a voice quite unlike the subdued voices speaking in the room.",
      "It was the bold, clamorous, self-assertive squall of the new human\nbeing, who had so incomprehensibly appeared.",
      "If Levin had been told before that Kitty was dead, and that he had died\nwith her, and that their children were angels, and that God was\nstanding before him, he would have been surprised at nothing.",
      "But now,\ncoming back to the world of reality, he had to make great mental\nefforts to take in that she was alive and well, and that the creature\nsqualling so desperately was his son.",
      "Kitty was alive, her agony was\nover.",
      "And he was unutterably happy.",
      "That he understood; he was\ncompletely happy in it.",
      "But the baby?",
      "Whence, why, who was he?...",
      "He\ncould not get used to the idea.",
      "It seemed to him something extraneous,\nsuperfluous, to which he could not accustom himself.",
      "Chapter 16\n\nAt ten o clock the old prince, Sergey Ivanovitch, and Stepan\nArkadyevitch were sitting at Levin s. Having inquired after Kitty, they\nhad dropped into conversation upon other subjects.",
      "Levin heard them,\nand unconsciously, as they talked, going over the past, over what had\nbeen up to that morning, he thought of himself as he had been yesterday\ntill that point.",
      "It was as though a hundred years had passed since\nthen.",
      "He felt himself exalted to unattainable heights, from which he\nstudiously lowered himself so as not to wound the people he was talking\nto.",
      "He talked, and was all the time thinking of his wife, of her\ncondition now, of his son, in whose existence he tried to school\nhimself into believing.",
      "The whole world of woman, which had taken for\nhim since his marriage a new value he had never suspected before, was\nnow so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination.",
      "He\nheard them talk of yesterday s dinner at the club, and thought:  What\nis happening with her now?",
      "Is she asleep?",
      "How is she?",
      "What is she\nthinking of?",
      "Is he crying, my son Dmitri?",
      "And in the middle of the\nconversation, in the middle of a sentence, he jumped up and went out of\nthe room.",
      "Send me word if I can see her,  said the prince.",
      "Very well, in a minute,  answered Levin, and without stopping, he went\nto her room.",
      "She was not asleep, she was talking gently with her mother, making\nplans about the christening.",
      "Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap\nwith some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her\nback.",
      "Meeting his eyes, her eyes drew him to her.",
      "Her face, bright\nbefore, brightened still more as he drew near her.",
      "There was the same\nchange in it from earthly to unearthly that is seen in the face of the\ndead.",
      "But then it means farewell, here it meant welcome.",
      "Again a rush\nof emotion, such as he had felt at the moment of the child s birth,\nflooded his heart.",
      "She took his hand and asked him if he had slept.",
      "He\ncould not answer, and turned away, struggling with his weakness.",
      "I have had a nap, Kostya!",
      "she said to him;  and I am so comfortable\nnow.",
      "She looked at him, but suddenly her expression changed.",
      "Give him to me,  she said, hearing the baby s cry.",
      "Give him to me,\nLizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.",
      "To be sure, his papa shall look at him,  said Lizaveta Petrovna,\ngetting up and bringing something red, and queer, and wriggling.",
      "Wait\na minute, we ll make him tidy first,  and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the\nred wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the\nbaby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering\nit with something.",
      "Levin, looking at the tiny, pitiful creature, made strenuous efforts to\ndiscover in his heart some traces of fatherly feeling for it.",
      "He felt\nnothing towards it but disgust.",
      "But when it was undressed and he caught\na glimpse of wee, wee, little hands, little feet, saffron-colored, with\nlittle toes, too, and positively with a little big toe different from\nthe rest, and when he saw Lizaveta Petrovna closing the wide-open\nlittle hands, as though they were soft springs, and putting them into\nlinen garments, such pity for the little creature came upon him, and\nsuch terror that she would hurt it, that he held her hand back.",
      "Lizaveta Petrovna laughed.",
      "Don t be frightened, don t be frightened!",
      "When the baby had been put to rights and transformed into a firm doll,\nLizaveta Petrovna dandled it as though proud of her handiwork, and\nstood a little away so that Levin might see his son in all his glory.",
      "Kitty looked sideways in the same direction, never taking her eyes off\nthe baby.",
      "Give him to me!",
      "give him to me!",
      "she said, and even made as\nthough she would sit up.",
      "What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn t move like\nthat!",
      "Wait a minute.",
      "I ll give him to you.",
      "Here we re showing papa what\na fine fellow we are!",
      "And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head,\nlifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head\nwas lost in its swaddling clothes.",
      "But it had a nose, too, and slanting\neyes and smacking lips.",
      "A splendid baby!",
      "said Lizaveta Petrovna.",
      "Levin sighed with mortification.",
      "This splendid baby excited in him no\nfeeling but disgust and compassion.",
      "It was not at all the feeling he\nhad looked forward to.",
      "He turned away while Lizaveta Petrovna put the baby to the unaccustomed\nbreast.",
      "Suddenly laughter made him look round.",
      "The baby had taken the breast.",
      "Come, that s enough, that s enough!",
      "said Lizaveta Petrovna, but Kitty\nwould not let the baby go.",
      "He fell asleep in her arms.",
      "Look, now,  said Kitty, turning the baby so that he could see it.",
      "The\naged-looking little face suddenly puckered up still more and the baby\nsneezed.",
      "Smiling, hardly able to restrain his tears, Levin kissed his wife and\nwent out of the dark room.",
      "What he felt towards this little creature\nwas utterly unlike what he had expected.",
      "There was nothing cheerful and\njoyous in the feeling; on the contrary, it was a new torture of\napprehension.",
      "It was the consciousness of a new sphere of liability to\npain.",
      "And this sense was so painful at first, the apprehension lest\nthis helpless creature should suffer was so intense, that it prevented\nhim from noticing the strange thrill of senseless joy and even pride\nthat he had felt when the baby sneezed.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch s affairs were in a very bad way.",
      "The money for two-thirds of the forest had all been spent already, and\nhe had borrowed from the merchant in advance at ten per cent discount,\nalmost all the remaining third.",
      "The merchant would not give more,\nespecially as Darya Alexandrovna, for the first time that winter\ninsisting on her right to her own property, had refused to sign the\nreceipt for the payment of the last third of the forest.",
      "All his salary\nwent on household expenses and in payment of petty debts that could not\nbe put off.",
      "There was positively no money.",
      "This was unpleasant and awkward, and in Stepan Arkadyevitch s opinion\nthings could not go on like this.",
      "The explanation of the position was,\nin his view, to be found in the fact that his salary was too small.",
      "The\npost he filled had been unmistakably very good five years ago, but it\nwas so no longer.",
      "Petrov, the bank director, had twelve thousand; Sventitsky, a company\ndirector, had seventeen thousand; Mitin, who had founded a bank,\nreceived fifty thousand.",
      "Clearly I ve been napping, and they ve overlooked me,  Stepan\nArkadyevitch thought about himself.",
      "And he began keeping his eyes and\nears open, and towards the end of the winter he had discovered a very\ngood berth and had formed a plan of attack upon it, at first from\nMoscow through aunts, uncles, and friends, and then, when the matter\nwas well advanced, in the spring, he went himself to Petersburg.",
      "It was\none of those snug, lucrative berths of which there are so many more\nnowadays than there used to be, with incomes ranging from one thousand\nto fifty thousand roubles.",
      "It was the post of secretary of the\ncommittee of the amalgamated agency of the southern railways, and of\ncertain banking companies.",
      "This position, like all such appointments,\ncalled for such immense energy and such varied qualifications, that it\nwas difficult for them to be found united in any one man.",
      "And since a\nman combining all the qualifications was not to be found, it was at\nleast better that the post be filled by an honest than by a dishonest\nman.",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch was not merely an honest\nman unemphatically in the common acceptation of the words, he was an\nhonest man emphatically in that special sense which the word has in\nMoscow, when they talk of an  honest  politician, an  honest  writer,\nan  honest  newspaper, an  honest  institution, an  honest  tendency,\nmeaning not simply that the man or the institution is not dishonest,\nbut that they are capable on occasion of taking a line of their own in\nopposition to the authorities.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch moved in those circles in Moscow in which that\nexpression had come into use, was regarded there as an honest man, and\nso had more right to this appointment than others.",
      "The appointment yielded an income of from seven to ten thousand a year,\nand Oblonsky could fill it without giving up his government position.",
      "It was in the hands of two ministers, one lady, and two Jews, and all\nthese people, though the way had been paved already with them, Stepan\nArkadyevitch had to see in Petersburg.",
      "Besides this business, Stepan\nArkadyevitch had promised his sister Anna to obtain from Karenin a\ndefinite answer on the question of divorce.",
      "And begging fifty roubles\nfrom Dolly, he set off for Petersburg.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch sat in Karenin s study listening to his report on\nthe causes of the unsatisfactory position of Russian finance, and only\nwaiting for the moment when he would finish to speak about his own\nbusiness or about Anna.",
      "Yes, that s very true,  he said, when Alexey Alexandrovitch took off\nthe pince-nez, without which he could not read now, and looked\ninquiringly at his former brother-in-law,  that s very true in\nparticular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.",
      "Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of\nfreedom,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, with emphasis on the word\n embracing,  and he put on his pince-nez again, so as to read the\npassage in which this statement was made.",
      "And turning over the\nbeautifully written, wide-margined manuscript, Alexey Alexandrovitch\nread aloud over again the conclusive passage.",
      "I don t advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for\nthe public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally,  he said,\nlooking over his pince-nez at Oblonsky.",
      "But _they_ cannot grasp that,\n_they_ are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by\nphrases.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch knew that when Karenin began to talk of what _they_\nwere doing and thinking, the persons who would not accept his report\nand were the cause of everything wrong in Russia, that it was coming\nnear the end.",
      "And so now he eagerly abandoned the principle of\nfree-trade, and fully agreed.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch paused,\nthoughtfully turning over the pages of his manuscript.",
      "Oh, by the way,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,  I wanted to ask you, some\ntime when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I should be very\nglad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the\namalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was familiar by now with the title of the post he\ncoveted, and he brought it out rapidly without mistake.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch questioned him as to the duties of this new\ncommittee, and pondered.",
      "He was considering whether the new committee\nwould not be acting in some way contrary to the views he had been\nadvocating.",
      "But as the influence of the new committee was of a very\ncomplex nature, and his views were of very wide application, he could\nnot decide this straight off, and taking off his pince-nez, he said:\n\n Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason precisely\nfor wishing to obtain the appointment?",
      "It s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means.... \n\n Nine thousand!",
      "repeated Alexey Alexandrovitch, and he frowned.",
      "The\nhigh figure of the salary made him reflect that on that side Stepan\nArkadyevitch s proposed position ran counter to the main tendency of\nhis own projects of reform, which always leaned towards economy.",
      "I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject,\nthat in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound\neconomic _assiette_ of our finances.",
      "But what s to be done?",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Suppose a bank\ndirector gets ten thousand well, he s worth it; or an engineer gets\ntwenty thousand after all, it s a growing thing, you know!",
      "I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought\nto conform with the law of supply and demand.",
      "If the salary is fixed\nwithout any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two\nengineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and\nefficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied\nwith two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special\nqualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense\nsalaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with\nthe law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest.",
      "And\nthis is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts\ninjuriously on the government service.",
      "I consider.... \n\nStepan Arkadyevitch made haste to interrupt his brother-in-law.",
      "Yes; but you must agree that it s a new institution of undoubted\nutility that s being started.",
      "After all, you know, it s a growing\nthing!",
      "What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on\nhonestly,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch with emphasis.",
      "But the Moscow significance of the word  honest  was lost on Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Honesty is only a negative qualification,  he said.",
      "Well, you ll do me a great service, anyway,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\n by putting in a word to Pomorsky just in the way of conversation....",
      "But I fancy it s more in Volgarinov s hands,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he s concerned,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, turning red.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch reddened at the mention\nof that name, because he had been that morning at the Jew Volgarinov s,\nand the visit had left an unpleasant recollection.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch believed most positively that the committee in\nwhich he was trying to get an appointment was a new, genuine, and\nhonest public body, but that morning when Volgarinov had intentionally,\nbeyond a doubt kept him two hours waiting with other petitioners in his\nwaiting room, he had suddenly felt uneasy.",
      "Whether he was uncomfortable that he, a descendant of Rurik, Prince\nOblonsky, had been kept for two hours waiting to see a Jew, or that for\nthe first time in his life he was not following the example of his\nancestors in serving the government, but was turning off into a new\ncareer, anyway he was very uncomfortable.",
      "During those two hours in\nVolgarinov s waiting room Stepan Arkadyevitch, stepping jauntily about\nthe room, pulling his whiskers, entering into conversation with the\nother petitioners, and inventing an epigram on his position,\nassiduously concealed from others, and even from himself, the feeling\nhe was experiencing.",
      "But all the time he was uncomfortable and angry, he could not have said\nwhy whether because he could not get his epigram just right, or from\nsome other reason.",
      "When at last Volgarinov had received him with\nexaggerated politeness and unmistakable triumph at his humiliation, and\nhad all but refused the favor asked of him, Stepan Arkadyevitch had\nmade haste to forget it all as soon as possible.",
      "And now, at the mere\nrecollection, he blushed.",
      "Chapter 18\n\n Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.",
      "About Anna,  Stepan Arkadyevitch said, pausing for a brief space, and\nshaking off the unpleasant impression.",
      "As soon as Oblonsky uttered Anna s name, the face of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch was completely transformed; all the life was gone out of\nit, and it looked weary and dead.",
      "What is it exactly that you want from me?",
      "he said, moving in his\nchair and snapping his pince-nez.",
      "A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of the\nposition.",
      "I m appealing to you  ( not as an injured husband,  Stepan\nArkadyevitch was going to say, but afraid of wrecking his negotiation\nby this, he changed the words)  not as a statesman  (which did not\nsound _  propos_),  but simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a\nChristian.",
      "You must have pity on her,  he said.",
      "That is, in what way precisely?",
      "Karenin said softly.",
      "Yes, pity on her.",
      "If you had seen her as I have!",
      "I have been spending\nall the winter with her you would have pity on her.",
      "Her position is\nawful, simply awful!",
      "I had imagined,  answered Alexey Alexandrovitch in a higher, almost\nshrill voice,  that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she had desired for\nherself.",
      "Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven s sake, don t let us indulge in\nrecriminations!",
      "What is past is past, and you know what she wants and\nis waiting for divorce.",
      "But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a\ncondition to leave me my son.",
      "I replied in that sense, and supposed\nthat the matter was ended.",
      "I consider it at an end,  shrieked Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "But, for heaven s sake, don t get hot!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\ntouching his brother-in-law s knee.",
      "The matter is not ended.",
      "If you\nwill allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you\nwere as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her\neverything freedom, divorce even.",
      "She appreciated that.",
      "No, don t think\nthat.",
      "She did appreciate it to such a degree that at the first moment,\nfeeling how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not\nconsider everything.",
      "She gave up everything.",
      "But experience, time, have\nshown that her position is unbearable, impossible.",
      "The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch put in, lifting his eyebrows.",
      "Allow me to disbelieve that,  Stepan Arkadyevitch replied gently.",
      "Her\nposition is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever.",
      "She has deserved it, you will say.",
      "She knows that and asks you for\nnothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you.",
      "But I, all of us,\nher relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you.",
      "Why should she\nsuffer?",
      "Who is any the better for it?",
      "Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party, \nobserved Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Oh, no, oh, no, not at all!",
      "please understand me,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, touching his hand again, as though feeling sure this\nphysical contact would soften his brother-in-law.",
      "All I say is this:\nher position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you, and you\nwill lose nothing by it.",
      "I will arrange it all for you, so that you ll\nnot notice it.",
      "You did promise it, you know.",
      "The promise was given before.",
      "And I had supposed that the question of\nmy son had settled the matter.",
      "Besides, I had hoped that Anna\nArkadyevna had enough generosity....  Alexey Alexandrovitch articulated\nwith difficulty, his lips twitching and his face white.",
      "She leaves it all to your generosity.",
      "She begs, she implores one thing\nof you to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is\nplaced.",
      "She does not ask for her son now.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch, you\nare a good man.",
      "Put yourself in her position for a minute.",
      "The question\nof divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death.",
      "If\nyou had not promised it once, she would have reconciled herself to her\nposition, she would have gone on living in the country.",
      "But you\npromised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow.",
      "And here she s\nbeen for six months in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to\nthe heart, every day expecting an answer.",
      "Why, it s like keeping a\ncondemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck,\npromising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy.",
      "Have pity on her, and I\nwill undertake to arrange everything.",
      "_Vos scrupules_....",
      "I am not talking about that, about that....  Alexey Alexandrovitch\ninterrupted with disgust.",
      "But, perhaps, I promised what I had no right\nto promise.",
      "So you go back from your promise?",
      "I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time to\nconsider how much of what I promised is possible.",
      "No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!",
      "cried Oblonsky, jumping up,  I won t\nbelieve that!",
      "She s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be, and you\ncannot refuse in such.... \n\n As much of what I promised as is possible.",
      "_Vous professez d tre\nlibre penseur._ But I as a believer cannot, in a matter of such\ngravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.",
      "But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I m aware, divorce\nis allowed,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Divorce is sanctioned even by\nour church.",
      "And we see....",
      "It is allowed, but not in the sense.... \n\n Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself,  said Oblonsky,\nafter a brief pause.",
      "Wasn t it you (and didn t we all appreciate it in\nyou?)",
      "who forgave everything, and moved simply by Christian feeling was\nready to make any sacrifice?",
      "You said yourself: if a man take thy coat,\ngive him thy cloak also, and now....",
      "I beg,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting suddenly onto his\nfeet, his face white and his jaws twitching,  I beg you to drop this\n... to drop ... this subject!",
      "Oh, no!",
      "Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,  said Stepan\nArkadyevitch, holding out his hand with a smile of embarrassment;  but\nlike a messenger I have simply performed the commission given me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch gave him his hand, pondered a little, and said:\n\n I must think it over and seek for guidance.",
      "The day after tomorrow I\nwill give you a final answer,  he said, after considering a moment.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch was about to go away when Korney came in to\nannounce:\n\n Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "Who s Sergey Alexyevitch?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was beginning, but he\nremembered immediately.",
      "Ah, Seryozha!",
      "he said aloud.",
      "Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "I thought it was\nthe director of a department.",
      "Anna asked me to see him too,  he\nthought.",
      "And he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which Anna had said\nto him at parting:  Anyway, you will see him.",
      "Find out exactly where he\nis, who is looking after him.",
      "And Stiva ... if it were possible!",
      "Could\nit be possible?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that  if it\nwere possible, if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let\nher have her son.... Stepan Arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to\ndream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke\nto the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single\nword about her.",
      "He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we had not\nforeseen,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Indeed, we feared for his life.",
      "But with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the summer, he regained\nhis strength, and now, by the doctor s advice, I have let him go to\nschool.",
      "And certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect\non him, and he is perfectly well, and making good progress.",
      "What a fine fellow he s grown!",
      "He s not Seryozha now, but quite\nfull-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as\nhe looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in blue coat and long\ntrousers, who walked in alertly and confidently.",
      "The boy looked healthy\nand good-humored.",
      "He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger, but\nrecognizing him, he blushed and turned hurriedly away from him, as\nthough offended and irritated at something.",
      "The boy went up to his\nfather and handed him a note of the marks he had gained in school.",
      "Well, that s very fair,  said his father,  you can go.",
      "He s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a\nboy; I like that,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Do you remember me?",
      "The boy looked back quickly at his uncle.",
      "Yes, _mon oncle_,  he answered, glancing at his father, and again he\nlooked downcast.",
      "His uncle called him to him, and took his hand.",
      "Well, and how are you getting on?",
      "he said, wanting to talk to him,\nand not knowing what to say.",
      "The boy, blushing and making no answer, cautiously drew his hand away.",
      "As soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch let go his hand, he glanced doubtfully\nat his father, and like a bird set free, he darted out of the room.",
      "A year had passed since the last time Seryozha had seen his mother.",
      "Since then he had heard nothing more of her.",
      "And in the course of that\nyear he had gone to school, and made friends among his schoolfellows.",
      "The dreams and memories of his mother, which had made him ill after\nseeing her, did not occupy his thoughts now.",
      "When they came back to\nhim, he studiously drove them away, regarding them as shameful and\ngirlish, below the dignity of a boy and a schoolboy.",
      "He knew that his\nfather and mother were separated by some quarrel, he knew that he had\nto remain with his father, and he tried to get used to that idea.",
      "He disliked seeing his uncle, so like his mother, for it called up\nthose memories of which he was ashamed.",
      "He disliked it all the more as\nfrom some words he had caught as he waited at the study door, and still\nmore from the faces of his father and uncle, he guessed that they must\nhave been talking of his mother.",
      "And to avoid condemning the father\nwith whom he lived and on whom he was dependent, and, above all, to\navoid giving way to sentimentality, which he considered so degrading,\nSeryozha tried not to look at his uncle who had come to disturb his\npeace of mind, and not to think of what he recalled to him.",
      "But when Stepan Arkadyevitch, going out after him, saw him on the\nstairs, and calling to him, asked him how he spent his playtime at\nschool, Seryozha talked more freely to him away from his father s\npresence.",
      "We have a railway now,  he said in answer to his uncle s question.",
      "It s like this, do you see: two sit on a bench they re the passengers;\nand one stands up straight on the bench.",
      "And all are harnessed to it by\ntheir arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms the\ndoors are left open beforehand.",
      "Well, and it s pretty hard work being\nthe conductor!",
      "That s the one that stands?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch inquired, smiling.",
      "Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they\nstop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.",
      "Yes, that must be a serious matter,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nwatching with mournful interest the eager eyes, like his mother s; not\nchildish now no longer fully innocent.",
      "And though he had promised\nAlexey Alexandrovitch not to speak of Anna, he could not restrain\nhimself.",
      "Do you remember your mother?",
      "he asked suddenly.",
      "No, I don t,  Seryozha said quickly.",
      "He blushed crimson, and his face\nclouded over.",
      "And his uncle could get nothing more out of him.",
      "His\ntutor found his pupil on the staircase half an hour later, and for a\nlong while he could not make out whether he was ill-tempered or crying.",
      "What is it?",
      "I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?",
      "said the\ntutor.",
      "I told you it was a dangerous game.",
      "And we shall have to speak\nto the director.",
      "If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that s\ncertain.",
      "Well, what is it, then?",
      "Leave me alone!",
      "If I remember, or if I don t remember?...",
      "what\nbusiness is it of his?",
      "Why should I remember?",
      "Leave me in peace!",
      "he\nsaid, addressing not his tutor, but the whole world.",
      "Chapter 20\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch, as usual, did not waste his time in Petersburg.",
      "In\nPetersburg, besides business, his sister s divorce, and his coveted\nappointment, he wanted, as he always did, to freshen himself up, as he\nsaid, after the mustiness of Moscow.",
      "In spite of its _caf s chantants_ and its omnibuses, Moscow was yet a\nstagnant bog.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch always felt it.",
      "After living for some\ntime in Moscow, especially in close relations with his family, he was\nconscious of a depression of spirits.",
      "After being a long time in Moscow\nwithout a change, he reached a point when he positively began to be\nworrying himself over his wife s ill-humor and reproaches, over his\nchildren s health and education, and the petty details of his official\nwork; even the fact of being in debt worried him.",
      "But he had only to go\nand stay a little while in Petersburg, in the circle there in which he\nmoved, where people lived really lived instead of vegetating as in\nMoscow, and all such ideas vanished and melted away at once, like wax\nbefore the fire.",
      "His wife?...",
      "Only that day he had been talking to\nPrince Tchetchensky.",
      "Prince Tchetchensky had a wife and family,\ngrown-up pages in the corps, ... and he had another illegitimate family\nof children also.",
      "Though the first family was very nice too, Prince\nTchetchensky felt happier in his second family; and he used to take his\neldest son with him to his second family, and told Stepan Arkadyevitch\nthat he thought it good for his son, enlarging his ideas.",
      "What would\nhave been said to that in Moscow?",
      "His children?",
      "In Petersburg children did not prevent their parents from\nenjoying life.",
      "The children were brought up in schools, and there was\nno trace of the wild idea that prevailed in Moscow, in Lvov s\nhousehold, for instance, that all the luxuries of life were for the\nchildren, while the parents have nothing but work and anxiety.",
      "Here\npeople understood that a man is in duty bound to live for himself, as\nevery man of culture should live.",
      "His official duties?",
      "Official work here was not the stiff, hopeless\ndrudgery that it was in Moscow.",
      "Here there was some interest in\nofficial life.",
      "A chance meeting, a service rendered, a happy phrase, a\nknack of facetious mimicry, and a man s career might be made in a\ntrice.",
      "So it had been with Bryantsev, whom Stepan Arkadyevitch had met\nthe previous day, and who was one of the highest functionaries in\ngovernment now.",
      "There was some interest in official work like that.",
      "The Petersburg attitude on pecuniary matters had an especially soothing\neffect on Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Bartnyansky, who must spend at least\nfifty thousand to judge by the style he lived in, had made an\ninteresting comment the day before on that subject.",
      "As they were talking before dinner, Stepan Arkadyevitch said to\nBartnyansky:\n\n You re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor:\nsay a word to him, please, for me.",
      "There s an appointment I should like\nto get secretary of the agency.... \n\n Oh, I shan t remember all that, if you tell it to me....",
      "But what\npossesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?...",
      "Take it as you\nwill, it s a low business.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch did not say to Bartnyansky that it was a  growing\nthing Bartnyansky would not have understood that.",
      "I want the money, I ve nothing to live on.",
      "You re living, aren t you?",
      "Yes, but in debt.",
      "Are you, though?",
      "Heavily?",
      "said Bartnyansky sympathetically.",
      "Very heavily: twenty thousand.",
      "Bartnyansky broke into good-humored laughter.",
      "Oh, lucky fellow!",
      "said he.",
      "My debts mount up to a million and a\nhalf, and I ve nothing, and still I can live, as you see!",
      "And Stepan Arkadyevitch saw the correctness of this view not in words\nonly but in actual fact.",
      "Zhivahov owed three hundred thousand, and\nhadn t a farthing to bless himself with, and he lived, and in style\ntoo!",
      "Count Krivtsov was considered a hopeless case by everyone, and yet\nhe kept two mistresses.",
      "Petrovsky had run through five millions, and\nstill lived in just the same style, and was even a manager in the\nfinancial department with a salary of twenty thousand.",
      "But besides\nthis, Petersburg had physically an agreeable effect on Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "It made him younger.",
      "In Moscow he sometimes found a gray\nhair in his head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly\nupstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women,\nand did not dance at balls.",
      "In Petersburg he always felt ten years\nyounger.",
      "His experience in Petersburg was exactly what had been described to him\non the previous day by Prince Pyotr Oblonsky, a man of sixty, who had\njust come back from abroad:\n\n We don t know the way to live here,  said Pyotr Oblonsky.",
      "I spent the\nsummer in Baden, and you wouldn t believe it, I felt quite a young man.",
      "At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts.... One dines and drinks a\nglass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything.",
      "I came home to\nRussia had to see my wife, and, what s more, go to my country place;\nand there, you d hardly believe it, in a fortnight I d got into a\ndressing gown and given up dressing for dinner.",
      "Needn t say I had no\nthoughts left for pretty women.",
      "I became quite an old gentleman.",
      "There\nwas nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation.",
      "I went\noff to Paris I was as right as could be at once.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch felt exactly the difference that Pyotr Oblonsky\ndescribed.",
      "In Moscow he degenerated so much that if he had had to be\nthere for long together, he might in good earnest have come to\nconsidering his salvation; in Petersburg he felt himself a man of the\nworld again.",
      "Between Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Stepan Arkadyevitch there had long\nexisted rather curious relations.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch always flirted\nwith her in jest, and used to say to her, also in jest, the most\nunseemly things, knowing that nothing delighted her so much.",
      "The day\nafter his conversation with Karenin, Stepan Arkadyevitch went to see\nher, and felt so youthful that in this jesting flirtation and nonsense\nhe recklessly went so far that he did not know how to extricate\nhimself, as unluckily he was so far from being attracted by her that he\nthought her positively disagreeable.",
      "What made it hard to change the\nconversation was the fact that he was very attractive to her.",
      "So that\nhe was considerably relieved at the arrival of Princess Myakaya, which\ncut short their _t te- -t te_.",
      "Ah, so you re here!",
      "said she when she saw him.",
      "Well, and what news\nof your poor sister?",
      "You needn t look at me like that,  she added.",
      "Ever since they ve all turned against her, all those who re a thousand\ntimes worse than she, I ve thought she did a very fine thing.",
      "I can t\nforgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg.",
      "I d\nhave gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.",
      "Please give\nher my love.",
      "Come, tell me about her.",
      "Yes, her position is very difficult; she....  began Stepan\nArkadyevitch, in the simplicity of his heart accepting as sterling coin\nPrincess Myakaya s words  tell me about her.",
      "Princess Myakaya\ninterrupted him immediately, as she always did, and began talking\nherself.",
      "She s done what they all do, except me only they hide it.",
      "But she\nwouldn t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing.",
      "And she did better\nstill in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours.",
      "You must\nexcuse me.",
      "Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I\nwas the only one that said he was a fool.",
      "Now that he s so thick with\nLidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he s crazy, and I should prefer\nnot to agree with everybody, but this time I can t help it.",
      "Oh, do please explain,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch;  what does it mean?",
      "Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister s behalf, and I asked him to\ngive me a final answer.",
      "He gave me no answer, and said he would think\nit over.",
      "But this morning, instead of an answer, I received an\ninvitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.",
      "Ah, so that s it, that s it!",
      "said Princess Myakaya gleefully,\n they re going to ask Landau what he s to say.",
      "Ask Landau?",
      "What for?",
      "Who or what s Landau?",
      "What!",
      "you don t know Jules Landau, _le fameux Jules Landau, le\nclairvoyant_?",
      "He s crazy too, but on him your sister s fate depends.",
      "See what comes of living in the provinces you know nothing about\nanything.",
      "Landau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Paris, and he\nwent to a doctor s; and in the doctor s waiting room he fell asleep,\nand in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients.",
      "And\nwonderful advice it was!",
      "Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky you know, the\ninvalid?",
      "heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband.",
      "And he\ncured her husband, though I can t say that I see he did him much good,\nfor he s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in\nhim, and took him along with them and brought him to Russia.",
      "Here\nthere s been a general rush to him, and he s begun doctoring everyone.",
      "He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she\nadopted him.",
      "Adopted him?",
      "Yes, as her son.",
      "He s not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov.",
      "That s neither here nor there, though; but Lidia I m very fond of her,\nbut she has a screw loose somewhere has lost her heart to this Landau\nnow, and nothing is settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch s\nwithout him, and so your sister s fate is now in the hands of Landau,\n_alias_ Count Bezzubov.",
      "Chapter 21\n\nAfter a capital dinner and a great deal of cognac drunk at\nBartnyansky s, Stepan Arkadyevitch, only a little later than the\nappointed time, went in to Countess Lidia Ivanovna s.\n\n Who else is with the countess?",
      "a Frenchman?",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch asked\nthe hall-porter, as he glanced at the familiar overcoat of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch and a queer, rather artless-looking overcoat with\nclasps.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,  the porter answered\nseverely.",
      "Princess Myakaya guessed right,  thought Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he\nwent upstairs.",
      "Curious!",
      "It would be quite as well, though, to get on\nfriendly terms with her.",
      "She has immense influence.",
      "If she would say a\nword to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.",
      "It was still quite light out-of-doors, but in Countess Lidia Ivanovna s\nlittle drawing-room the blinds were drawn and the lamps lighted.",
      "At a\nround table under a lamp sat the countess and Alexey Alexandrovitch,\ntalking softly.",
      "A short, thinnish man, very pale and handsome, with\nfeminine hips and knock-kneed legs, with fine brilliant eyes and long\nhair lying on the collar of his coat, was standing at the end of the\nroom gazing at the portraits on the wall.",
      "After greeting the lady of\nthe house and Alexey Alexandrovitch, Stepan Arkadyevitch could not\nresist glancing once more at the unknown man.",
      "Monsieur Landau!",
      "the countess addressed him with a softness and\ncaution that impressed Oblonsky.",
      "And she introduced them.",
      "Landau looked round hurriedly, came up, and smiling, laid his moist,\nlifeless hand in Stepan Arkadyevitch s outstretched hand and\nimmediately walked away and fell to gazing at the portraits again.",
      "The\ncountess and Alexey Alexandrovitch looked at each other significantly.",
      "I am very glad to see you, particularly today,  said Countess Lidia\nIvanovna, pointing Stepan Arkadyevitch to a seat beside Karenin.",
      "I introduced you to him as Landau,  she said in a soft voice, glancing\nat the Frenchman and again immediately after at Alexey Alexandrovitch,\n but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you re probably aware.",
      "Only he\ndoes not like the title.",
      "Yes, I heard so,  answered Stepan Arkadyevitch;  they say he\ncompletely cured Countess Bezzubova.",
      "She was here today, poor thing!",
      "the countess said, turning to Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "This separation is awful for her.",
      "It s such a blow to\nher!",
      "And he positively is going?",
      "queried Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "Yes, he s going to Paris.",
      "He heard a voice yesterday,  said Countess\nLidia Ivanovna, looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Ah, a voice!",
      "repeated Oblonsky, feeling that he must be as\ncircumspect as he possibly could in this society, where something\npeculiar was going on, or was to go on, to which he had not the key.",
      "A moment s silence followed, after which Countess Lidia Ivanovna, as\nthough approaching the main topic of conversation, said with a fine\nsmile to Oblonsky:\n\n I ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer\nacquaintance with you.",
      "_Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis._ But to be\na true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one s friend,\nand I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch.",
      "You understand what I mean?",
      "she said, lifting her fine\npensive eyes.",
      "In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch....  said Oblonsky.",
      "Having no clear idea what they were\ntalking about, he wanted to confine himself to generalities.",
      "The change is not in his external position,  Countess Lidia Ivanovna\nsaid sternly, following with eyes of love the figure of Alexey\nAlexandrovitch as he got up and crossed over to Landau;  his heart is\nchanged, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you don t\nfully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.",
      "Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change.",
      "We have\nalways been friendly, and now....  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, responding\nwith a sympathetic glance to the expression of the countess, and\nmentally balancing the question with which of the two ministers she was\nmost intimate, so as to know about which to ask her to speak for him.",
      "The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his\nneighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his\nheart.",
      "But I am afraid you do not understand me.",
      "Won t you have some\ntea?",
      "she said, with her eyes indicating the footman, who was handing\nround tea on a tray.",
      "Not quite, countess.",
      "Of course, his misfortune....",
      "Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when his\nheart was made new, was filled full of it,  she said, gazing with eyes\nfull of love at Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,  thought Stepan\nArkadyevitch.",
      "Oh, of course, countess,  he said;  but I imagine such changes are a\nmatter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, would\ncare to speak of them.",
      "On the contrary!",
      "We ought to speak freely and help one another.",
      "Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions,\nand besides....  said Oblonsky with a soft smile.",
      "There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.",
      "Oh, no, of course; but....  and Stepan Arkadyevitch paused in\nconfusion.",
      "He understood at last that they were talking of religion.",
      "I fancy he will fall asleep immediately,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch\nin a whisper full of meaning, going up to Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch looked round.",
      "Landau was sitting at the window,\nleaning on his elbow and the back of his chair, his head drooping.",
      "Noticing that all eyes were turned on him he raised his head and smiled\na smile of childlike artlessness.",
      "Don t take any notice,  said Lidia Ivanovna, and she lightly moved a\nchair up for Alexey Alexandrovitch.",
      "I have observed....  she was\nbeginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter.",
      "Lidia\nIvanovna rapidly ran her eyes over the note, and excusing herself,\nwrote an answer with extraordinary rapidity, handed it to the man, and\ncame back to the table.",
      "I have observed,  she went on,  that Moscow\npeople, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than\nanyone.",
      "Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of being\nthe firmest in the faith,  answered Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the\nindifferent ones,  said Alexey Alexandrovitch, turning to him with a\nweary smile.",
      "How anyone can be indifferent!",
      "said Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in\nsuspense,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, with his most deprecating smile.",
      "I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna looked at each other.",
      "We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,  said\nAlexey Alexandrovitch severely.",
      "We ought not to think whether we are\nready or not ready.",
      "God s grace is not guided by human considerations:\nsometimes it comes not to those that strive for it, and comes to those\nthat are unprepared, like Saul.",
      "No, I believe it won t be just yet,  said Lidia Ivanovna, who had been\nmeanwhile watching the movements of the Frenchman.",
      "Landau got up and\ncame to them.",
      "Do you allow me to listen?",
      "he asked.",
      "Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,  said Lidia Ivanovna, gazing\ntenderly at him;  sit here with us.",
      "One has only not to close one s eyes to shut out the light,  Alexey\nAlexandrovitch went on.",
      "Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever in\nour hearts!",
      "said Countess Lidia Ivanovna with a rapturous smile.",
      "But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height, \nsaid Stepan Arkadyevitch, conscious of hypocrisy in admitting this\nreligious height, but at the same time unable to bring himself to\nacknowledge his free-thinking views before a person who, by a single\nword to Pomorsky, might procure him the coveted appointment.",
      "That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?",
      "said Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "But\nthat is a false idea.",
      "There is no sin for believers, their sin has been\natoned for.",
      "_Pardon,_  she added, looking at the footman, who came in\nagain with another letter.",
      "She read it and gave a verbal answer:\n Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess s, say.",
      "For the believer sin is not, \nshe went on.",
      "Yes, but faith without works is dead,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nrecalling the phrase from the catechism, and only by his smile clinging\nto his independence.",
      "There you have it from the epistle of St. James,  said Alexey\nAlexandrovitch, addressing Lidia Ivanovna, with a certain\nreproachfulness in his tone.",
      "It was unmistakably a subject they had\ndiscussed more than once before.",
      "What harm has been done by the false\ninterpretation of that passage!",
      "Nothing holds men back from belief like\nthat misinterpretation.",
      "I have not works, so I cannot believe,  though\nall the while that is not said.",
      "But the very opposite is said.",
      "Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,  said Countess Lidia\nIvanovna, with disgusted contempt,  those are the crude ideas of our\nmonks....",
      "Yet that is nowhere said.",
      "It is far simpler and easier,  she\nadded, looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which\nat court she encouraged youthful maids of honor, disconcerted by the\nnew surroundings of the court.",
      "We are saved by Christ who suffered for us.",
      "We are saved by faith, \nAlexey Alexandrovitch chimed in, with a glance of approval at her\nwords.",
      "_ Vous comprenez l anglais?",
      "_ asked Lidia Ivanovna, and receiving a\nreply in the affirmative, she got up and began looking through a shelf\nof books.",
      "I want to read him  Safe and Happy,  or  Under the Wing,  she said,\nlooking inquiringly at Karenin.",
      "And finding the book, and sitting down\nagain in her place, she opened it.",
      "It s very short.",
      "In it is described\nthe way by which faith can be reached, and the happiness, above all\nearthly bliss, with which it fills the soul.",
      "The believer cannot be\nunhappy because he is not alone.",
      "But you will see.",
      "She was just\nsettling herself to read when the footman came in again.",
      "Madame\nBorozdina?",
      "Tell her, tomorrow at two o clock.",
      "Yes,  she said, putting\nher finger in the place in the book, and gazing before her with her\nfine pensive eyes,  that is how true faith acts.",
      "You know Marie Sanina?",
      "You know about her trouble?",
      "She lost her only child.",
      "She was in\ndespair.",
      "And what happened?",
      "She found this comforter, and she thanks\nGod now for the death of her child.",
      "Such is the happiness faith\nbrings!",
      "Oh, yes, that is most....  said Stepan Arkadyevitch, glad they were\ngoing to read, and let him have a chance to collect his faculties.",
      "No,\nI see I d better not ask her about anything today,  he thought.",
      "If\nonly I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!",
      "It will be dull for you,  said Countess Lidia Ivanovna, addressing\nLandau;  you don t know English, but it s short.",
      "Oh, I shall understand,  said Landau, with the same smile, and he\nclosed his eyes.",
      "Alexey Alexandrovitch and Lidia Ivanovna exchanged\nmeaningful glances, and the reading began.",
      "Chapter 22\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch felt completely nonplussed by the strange talk\nwhich he was hearing for the first time.",
      "The complexity of Petersburg,\nas a rule, had a stimulating effect on him, rousing him out of his\nMoscow stagnation.",
      "But he liked these complications, and understood\nthem only in the circles he knew and was at home in.",
      "In these\nunfamiliar surroundings he was puzzled and disconcerted, and could not\nget his bearings.",
      "As he listened to Countess Lidia Ivanovna, aware of\nthe beautiful, artless or perhaps artful, he could not decide\nwhich eyes of Landau fixed upon him, Stepan Arkadyevitch began to be\nconscious of a peculiar heaviness in his head.",
      "The most incongruous ideas were in confusion in his head.",
      "Marie Sanina\nis glad her child s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!...",
      "To be\nsaved, one need only believe, and the monks don t know how the thing s\nto be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my\nhead so heavy?",
      "Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer?",
      "Anyway, I\nfancy I ve done nothing unsuitable so far.",
      "But anyway, it won t do to\nask her now.",
      "They say they make one say one s prayers.",
      "I only hope they\nwon t make me!",
      "That ll be too imbecile.",
      "And what stuff it is she s\nreading!",
      "but she has a good accent.",
      "Landau Bezzubov what s he Bezzubov\nfor?",
      "All at once Stepan Arkadyevitch became aware that his lower jaw\nwas uncontrollably forming a yawn.",
      "He pulled his whiskers to cover the\nyawn, and shook himself together.",
      "But soon after he became aware that\nhe was dropping asleep and on the very point of snoring.",
      "He recovered\nhimself at the very moment when the voice of Countess Lidia Ivanovna\nwas saying  he s asleep.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch started with dismay,\nfeeling guilty and caught.",
      "But he was reassured at once by seeing that\nthe words  he s asleep  referred not to him, but to Landau.",
      "The\nFrenchman was asleep as well as Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "But Stepan\nArkadyevitch s being asleep would have offended them, as he thought\n(though even this, he thought, might not be so, as everything seemed so\nqueer), while Landau s being asleep delighted them extremely,\nespecially Countess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "_ Mon ami, _ said Lidia Ivanovna, carefully holding the folds of her\nsilk gown so as not to rustle, and in her excitement calling Karenin\nnot Alexey Alexandrovitch, but _ mon ami,   donnez-lui la main.",
      "Vous\nvoyez?_ Sh!",
      "she hissed at the footman as he came in again.",
      "Not at\nhome.",
      "The Frenchman was asleep, or pretending to be asleep, with his head on\nthe back of his chair, and his moist hand, as it lay on his knee, made\nfaint movements, as though trying to catch something.",
      "Alexey\nAlexandrovitch got up, tried to move carefully, but stumbled against\nthe table, went up and laid his hand in the Frenchman s hand.",
      "Stepan\nArkadyevitch got up too, and opening his eyes wide, trying to wake\nhimself up if he were asleep, he looked first at one and then at the\nother.",
      "It was all real.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch felt that his head was\ngetting worse and worse.",
      "_Que la personne qui est arriv e la derni re, celle qui demande,\nqu elle sorte!",
      "Qu elle sorte!_  articulated the Frenchman, without\nopening his eyes.",
      "_Vous m excuserez, mais vous voyez.... Revenez vers dix heures, encore\nmieux demain._ \n\n _Qu elle sorte!_  repeated the Frenchman impatiently.",
      "_C est moi, n est-ce pas?_  And receiving an answer in the\naffirmative, Stepan Arkadyevitch, forgetting the favor he had meant to\nask of Lidia Ivanovna, and forgetting his sister s affairs, caring for\nnothing, but filled with the sole desire to get away as soon as\npossible, went out on tiptoe and ran out into the street as though from\na plague-stricken house.",
      "For a long while he chatted and joked with his\ncab-driver, trying to recover his spirits.",
      "At the French theater where he arrived for the last act, and afterwards\nat the Tatar restaurant after his champagne, Stepan Arkadyevitch felt a\nlittle refreshed in the atmosphere he was used to.",
      "But still he felt\nquite unlike himself all that evening.",
      "On getting home to Pyotr Oblonsky s, where he was staying, Stepan\nArkadyevitch found a note from Betsy.",
      "She wrote to him that she was\nvery anxious to finish their interrupted conversation, and begged him\nto come next day.",
      "He had scarcely read this note, and frowned at its\ncontents, when he heard below the ponderous tramp of the servants,\ncarrying something heavy.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch went out to look.",
      "It was the rejuvenated Pyotr\nOblonsky.",
      "He was so drunk that he could not walk upstairs; but he told\nthem to set him on his legs when he saw Stepan Arkadyevitch, and\nclinging to him, walked with him into his room and there began telling\nhim how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep doing so.",
      "Stepan Arkadyevitch was in very low spirits, which happened rarely with\nhim, and for a long while he could not go to sleep.",
      "Everything he could\nrecall to his mind, everything was disgusting; but most disgusting of\nall, as if it were something shameful, was the memory of the evening he\nhad spent at Countess Lidia Ivanovna s.\n\nNext day he received from Alexey Alexandrovitch a final answer,\nrefusing to grant Anna s divorce, and he understood that this decision\nwas based on what the Frenchman had said in his real or pretended\ntrance.",
      "Chapter 23\n\nIn order to carry through any undertaking in family life, there must\nnecessarily be either complete division between the husband and wife,\nor loving agreement.",
      "When the relations of a couple are vacillating and\nneither one thing nor the other, no sort of enterprise can be\nundertaken.",
      "Many families remain for years in the same place, though both husband\nand wife are sick of it, simply because there is neither complete\ndivision nor agreement between them.",
      "Both Vronsky and Anna felt life in Moscow insupportable in the heat and\ndust, when the spring sunshine was followed by the glare of summer, and\nall the trees in the boulevards had long since been in full leaf, and\nthe leaves were covered with dust.",
      "But they did not go back to\nVozdvizhenskoe, as they had arranged to do long before; they went on\nstaying in Moscow, though they both loathed it, because of late there\nhad been no agreement between them.",
      "The irritability that kept them apart had no external cause, and all\nefforts to come to an understanding intensified it, instead of removing\nit.",
      "It was an inner irritation, grounded in her mind on the conviction\nthat his love had grown less; in his, on regret that he had put himself\nfor her sake in a difficult position, which she, instead of lightening,\nmade still more difficult.",
      "Neither of them gave full utterance to their\nsense of grievance, but they considered each other in the wrong, and\ntried on every pretext to prove this to one another.",
      "In her eyes the whole of him, with all his habits, ideas, desires, with\nall his spiritual and physical temperament, was one thing love for\nwomen, and that love, she felt, ought to be entirely concentrated on\nher alone.",
      "That love was less; consequently, as she reasoned, he must\nhave transferred part of his love to other women or to another\nwoman and she was jealous.",
      "She was jealous not of any particular woman\nbut of the decrease of his love.",
      "Not having got an object for her\njealousy, she was on the lookout for it.",
      "At the slightest hint she\ntransferred her jealousy from one object to another.",
      "At one time she\nwas jealous of those low women with whom he might so easily renew his\nold bachelor ties; then she was jealous of the society women he might\nmeet; then she was jealous of the imaginary girl whom he might want to\nmarry, for whose sake he would break with her.",
      "And this last form of\njealousy tortured her most of all, especially as he had unwarily told\nher, in a moment of frankness, that his mother knew him so little that\nshe had had the audacity to try and persuade him to marry the young\nPrincess Sorokina.",
      "And being jealous of him, Anna was indignant against him and found\ngrounds for indignation in everything.",
      "For everything that was\ndifficult in her position she blamed him.",
      "The agonizing condition of\nsuspense she had passed in Moscow, the tardiness and indecision of\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, her solitude she put it all down to him.",
      "If he\nhad loved her he would have seen all the bitterness of her position,\nand would have rescued her from it.",
      "For her being in Moscow and not in\nthe country, he was to blame too.",
      "He could not live buried in the\ncountry as she would have liked to do.",
      "He must have society, and he had\nput her in this awful position, the bitterness of which he would not\nsee.",
      "And again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from\nher son.",
      "Even the rare moments of tenderness that came from time to time did not\nsoothe her; in his tenderness now she saw a shade of complacency, of\nself-confidence, which had not been of old, and which exasperated her.",
      "It was dusk.",
      "Anna was alone, and waiting for him to come back from a\nbachelor dinner.",
      "She walked up and down in his study (the room where\nthe noise from the street was least heard), and thought over every\ndetail of their yesterday s quarrel.",
      "Going back from the\nwell-remembered, offensive words of the quarrel to what had been the\nground of it, she arrived at last at its origin.",
      "For a long while she\ncould hardly believe that their dissension had arisen from a\nconversation so inoffensive, of so little moment to either.",
      "But so it\nactually had been.",
      "It all arose from his laughing at the girls  high\nschools, declaring they were useless, while she defended them.",
      "He had\nspoken slightingly of women s education in general, and had said that\nHannah, Anna s English prot g e, had not the slightest need to know\nanything of physics.",
      "This irritated Anna.",
      "She saw in this a contemptuous reference to her\noccupations.",
      "And she bethought her of a phrase to pay him back for the\npain he had given her.",
      "I don t expect you to understand me, my\nfeelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did\nexpect,  she said.",
      "And he had actually flushed with vexation, and had said something\nunpleasant.",
      "She could not recall her answer, but at that point, with an\nunmistakable desire to wound her too, he had said:\n\n I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that s true,\nbecause I see it s unnatural.",
      "The cruelty with which he shattered the world she had built up for\nherself so laboriously to enable her to endure her hard life, the\ninjustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of\nartificiality, aroused her.",
      "I am very sorry that nothing but what s coarse and material is\ncomprehensible and natural to you,  she said and walked out of the\nroom.",
      "When he had come in to her yesterday evening, they had not referred to\nthe quarrel, but both felt that the quarrel had been smoothed over, but\nwas not at an end.",
      "Today he had not been at home all day, and she felt so lonely and\nwretched in being on bad terms with him that she wanted to forget it\nall, to forgive him, and be reconciled with him; she wanted to throw\nthe blame on herself and to justify him.",
      "I am myself to blame.",
      "I m irritable, I m insanely jealous.",
      "I will make\nit up with him, and we ll go away to the country; there I shall be more\nat peace.",
      "Unnatural!",
      "She suddenly recalled the word that had stung her most of\nall, not so much the word itself as the intent to wound her with which\nit was said.",
      "I know what he meant; he meant unnatural, not loving my\nown daughter, to love another person s child.",
      "What does he know of love\nfor children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I ve sacrificed for him?",
      "But that wish to wound me!",
      "No, he loves another woman, it must be so.",
      "And perceiving that, while trying to regain her peace of mind, she had\ngone round the same circle that she had been round so often before, and\nhad come back to her former state of exasperation, she was horrified at\nherself.",
      "Can it be impossible?",
      "Can it be beyond me to control myself?",
      "she said to herself, and began again from the beginning.",
      "He s\ntruthful, he s honest, he loves me.",
      "I love him, and in a few days the\ndivorce will come.",
      "What more do I want?",
      "I want peace of mind and trust,\nand I will take the blame on myself.",
      "Yes, now when he comes in, I will\ntell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away\ntomorrow.",
      "And to escape thinking any more, and being overcome by irritability,\nshe rang, and ordered the boxes to be brought up for packing their\nthings for the country.",
      "At ten o clock Vronsky came in.",
      "Chapter 24\n\n Well, was it nice?",
      "she asked, coming out to meet him with a penitent\nand meek expression.",
      "Just as usual,  he answered, seeing at a glance that she was in one of\nher good moods.",
      "He was used by now to these transitions, and he was\nparticularly glad to see it today, as he was in a specially good humor\nhimself.",
      "What do I see?",
      "Come, that s good!",
      "he said, pointing to the boxes in\nthe passage.",
      "Yes, we must go.",
      "I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed\nto be in the country.",
      "There s nothing to keep you, is there?",
      "It s the one thing I desire.",
      "I ll be back directly, and we ll talk it\nover; I only want to change my coat.",
      "Order some tea.",
      "And he went into his room.",
      "There was something mortifying in the way he had said  Come, that s\ngood,  as one says to a child when it leaves off being naughty, and\nstill more mortifying was the contrast between her penitent and his\nself-confident tone; and for one instant she felt the lust of strife\nrising up in her again, but making an effort she conquered it, and met\nVronsky as good-humoredly as before.",
      "When he came in she told him, partly repeating phrases she had prepared\nbeforehand, how she had spent the day, and her plans for going away.",
      "You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,  she said.",
      "Why\nwait here for the divorce?",
      "Won t it be just the same in the country?",
      "I\ncan t wait any longer!",
      "I don t want to go on hoping, I don t want to\nhear anything about the divorce.",
      "I have made up my mind it shall not\nhave any more influence on my life.",
      "Do you agree?",
      "Oh, yes!",
      "he said, glancing uneasily at her excited face.",
      "What did you do?",
      "Who was there?",
      "she said, after a pause.",
      "Vronsky mentioned the names of the guests.",
      "The dinner was first rate,\nand the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they\ncan never do anything without something _ridicule_.",
      "A lady of a sort\nappeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and\ngave us an exhibition of her skill.",
      "How?",
      "did she swim?",
      "asked Anna, frowning.",
      "In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.",
      "So when shall we go?",
      "What an absurd fancy!",
      "Why, did she swim in some special way, then?",
      "said Anna, not answering.",
      "There was absolutely nothing in it.",
      "That s just what I say, it was\nawfully stupid.",
      "Well, then, when do you think of going?",
      "Anna shook her head as though trying to drive away some unpleasant\nidea.",
      "When?",
      "Why, the sooner the better!",
      "By tomorrow we shan t be ready.",
      "The\nday after tomorrow.",
      "Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute!",
      "The day after tomorrow s Sunday, I have\nto be at maman s,  said Vronsky, embarrassed, because as soon as he\nuttered his mother s name he was aware of her intent, suspicious eyes.",
      "His embarrassment confirmed her suspicion.",
      "She flushed hotly and drew\naway from him.",
      "It was now not the Queen of Sweden s swimming-mistress\nwho filled Anna s imagination, but the young Princess Sorokina.",
      "She was\nstaying in a village near Moscow with Countess Vronskaya.",
      "Can t you go tomorrow?",
      "she said.",
      "Well, no!",
      "The deeds and the money for the business I m going there for\nI can t get by tomorrow,  he answered.",
      "If so, we won t go at all.",
      "But why so?",
      "I shall not go later.",
      "Monday or never!",
      "What for?",
      "said Vronsky, as though in amazement.",
      "Why, there s no\nmeaning in it!",
      "There s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me.",
      "You\ndon t care to understand my life.",
      "The one thing that I cared for here\nwas Hannah.",
      "You say it s affectation.",
      "Why, you said yesterday that I\ndon t love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it s\nunnatural.",
      "I should like to know what life there is for me that could\nbe natural!",
      "For an instant she had a clear vision of what she was doing, and was\nhorrified at how she had fallen away from her resolution.",
      "But even\nthough she knew it was her own ruin, she could not restrain herself,\ncould not keep herself from proving to him that he was wrong, could not\ngive way to him.",
      "I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden\npassion.",
      "How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you don t\ntell the truth?",
      "I never boast, and I never tell lies,  he said slowly, restraining his\nrising anger.",
      "It s a great pity if you can t respect....",
      "Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.",
      "And if you don t love me any more, it would be better and more honest\nto say so.",
      "No, this is becoming unbearable!",
      "cried Vronsky, getting up from his\nchair; and stopping short, facing her, he said, speaking deliberately:\n What do you try my patience for?",
      "looking as though he might have said\nmuch more, but was restraining himself.",
      "It has limits.",
      "What do you mean by that?",
      "she cried, looking with terror at the\nundisguised hatred in his whole face, and especially in his cruel,\nmenacing eyes.",
      "I mean to say....  he was beginning, but he checked himself.",
      "I must\nask what it is you want of me?",
      "What can I want?",
      "All I can want is that you should not desert me, as\nyou think of doing,  she said, understanding all he had not uttered.",
      "But that I don t want; that s secondary.",
      "I want love, and there is\nnone.",
      "So then all is over.",
      "She turned towards the door.",
      "Stop!",
      "sto-op!",
      "said Vronsky, with no change in the gloomy lines of his\nbrows, though he held her by the hand.",
      "What is it all about?",
      "I said\nthat we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I\nwas lying, that I was not an honorable man.",
      "Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having\nsacrificed everything for me,  she said, recalling the words of a still\nearlier quarrel,  that he s worse than a dishonorable man he s a\nheartless man.",
      "Oh, there are limits to endurance!",
      "he cried, and hastily let go her\nhand.",
      "He hates me, that s clear,  she thought, and in silence, without\nlooking round, she walked with faltering steps out of the room.",
      "He\nloves another woman, that s even clearer,  she said to herself as she\nwent into her own room.",
      "I want love, and there is none.",
      "So, then, all\nis over.",
      "She repeated the words she had said,  and it must be ended.",
      "But how?",
      "she asked herself, and she sat down in a low chair before\nthe looking-glass.",
      "Thoughts of where she would go now, whether to the aunt who had brought\nher up, to Dolly, or simply alone abroad, and of what _he_ was doing\nnow alone in his study; whether this was the final quarrel, or whether\nreconciliation were still possible; and of what all her old friends at\nPetersburg would say of her now; and of how Alexey Alexandrovitch would\nlook at it, and many other ideas of what would happen now after this\nrupture, came into her head; but she did not give herself up to them\nwith all her heart.",
      "At the bottom of her heart was some obscure idea\nthat alone interested her, but she could not get clear sight of it.",
      "Thinking once more of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she recalled the time of\nher illness after her confinement, and the feeling which never left her\nat that time.",
      "Why didn t I die?",
      "and the words and the feeling of that\ntime came back to her.",
      "And all at once she knew what was in her soul.",
      "Yes, it was that idea which alone solved all.",
      "Yes, to die!...",
      "And the\nshame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my\nawful shame, it will all be saved by death.",
      "To die!",
      "and he will feel\nremorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.",
      "With the trace of a smile of commiseration for herself she sat down in\nthe armchair, taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand,\nvividly picturing from different sides his feelings after her death.",
      "Approaching footsteps his steps distracted her attention.",
      "As though\nabsorbed in the arrangement of her rings, she did not even turn to him.",
      "He went up to her, and taking her by the hand, said softly:\n\n Anna, we ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like.",
      "I agree to\neverything.",
      "She did not speak.",
      "What is it?",
      "he urged.",
      "You know,  she said, and at the same instant, unable to restrain\nherself any longer, she burst into sobs.",
      "Cast me off!",
      "she articulated between her sobs.",
      "I ll go away tomorrow\n...",
      "I ll do more.",
      "What am I?",
      "An immoral woman!",
      "A stone round your neck.",
      "I don t want to make you wretched, I don t want to!",
      "I ll set you free.",
      "You don t love me; you love someone else!",
      "Vronsky besought her to be calm, and declared that there was no trace\nof foundation for her jealousy; that he had never ceased, and never\nwould cease, to love her; that he loved her more than ever.",
      "Anna, why distress yourself and me so?",
      "he said to her, kissing her\nhands.",
      "There was tenderness now in his face, and she fancied she caught\nthe sound of tears in his voice, and she felt them wet on her hand.",
      "And\ninstantly Anna s despairing jealousy changed to a despairing passion of\ntenderness.",
      "She put her arms round him, and covered with kisses his\nhead, his neck, his hands.",
      "Chapter 25\n\nFeeling that the reconciliation was complete, Anna set eagerly to work\nin the morning preparing for their departure.",
      "Though it was not settled\nwhether they should go on Monday or Tuesday, as they had each given way\nto the other, Anna packed busily, feeling absolutely indifferent\nwhether they went a day earlier or later.",
      "She was standing in her room\nover an open box, taking things out of it, when he came in to see her\nearlier than usual, dressed to go out.",
      "I m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by\nYegorov.",
      "And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,  he said.",
      "Though she was in such a good mood, the thought of his visit to his\nmother s gave her a pang.",
      "No, I shan t be ready by then myself,  she said; and at once\nreflected,  so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.",
      "No,\ndo as you meant to do.",
      "Go into the dining-room, I m coming directly.",
      "It s only to turn out those things that aren t wanted,  she said,\nputting something more on the heap of frippery that lay in Annushka s\narms.",
      "Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she came into the dining-room.",
      "You wouldn t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me, \nshe said, sitting down beside him to her coffee.",
      "There s nothing more\nawful than these _chambres garnies_.",
      "There s no individuality in them,\nno soul.",
      "These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the\nwallpapers they re a nightmare.",
      "I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the\npromised land.",
      "You re not sending the horses off yet?",
      "No, they will come after us.",
      "Where are you going to?",
      "I wanted to go to Wilson s to take some dresses to her.",
      "So it s really\nto be tomorrow?",
      "she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face\nchanged.",
      "Vronsky s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram\nfrom Petersburg.",
      "There was nothing out of the way in Vronsky s getting\na telegram, but he said, as though anxious to conceal something from\nher, that the receipt was in his study, and he turned hurriedly to her.",
      "By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.",
      "From whom is the telegram?",
      "she asked, not hearing him.",
      "From Stiva,  he answered reluctantly.",
      "Why didn t you show it to me?",
      "What secret can there be between Stiva\nand me?",
      "Vronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.",
      "I didn t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion for\ntelegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?",
      "About the divorce?",
      "Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet.",
      "He has\npromised a decisive answer in a day or two.",
      "But here it is; read it.",
      "With trembling hands Anna took the telegram, and read what Vronsky had\ntold her.",
      "At the end was added:  Little hope; but I will do everything\npossible and impossible.",
      "I said yesterday that it s absolutely nothing to me when I get, or\nwhether I never get, a divorce,  she said, flushing crimson.",
      "There was\nnot the slightest necessity to hide it from me.",
      "So he may hide and\ndoes hide his correspondence with women from me,  she thought.",
      "Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov,  said Vronsky;  I\nbelieve he s won from Pyevtsov all and more than he can pay, about\nsixty thousand.",
      "No,  she said, irritated by his so obviously showing by this change of\nsubject that he was irritated,  why did you suppose that this news\nwould affect me so, that you must even try to hide it?",
      "I said I don t\nwant to consider it, and I should have liked you to care as little\nabout it as I do.",
      "I care about it because I like definiteness,  he said.",
      "Definiteness is not in the form but the love,  she said, more and more\nirritated, not by his words, but by the tone of cool composure in which\nhe spoke.",
      "What do you want it for?",
      "My God!",
      "love again,  he thought, frowning.",
      "Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children s in the\nfuture.",
      "There won t be children in the future.",
      "That s a great pity,  he said.",
      "You want it for the children s sake, but you don t think of me?",
      "she\nsaid, quite forgetting or not having heard that he had said,  _For your\nsake_ and the children s. \n\nThe question of the possibility of having children had long been a\nsubject of dispute and irritation to her.",
      "His desire to have children\nshe interpreted as a proof he did not prize her beauty.",
      "Oh, I said: for your sake.",
      "Above all for your sake,  he repeated,\nfrowning as though in pain,  because I am certain that the greater part\nof your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.",
      "Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred for\nme is apparent,  she thought, not hearing his words, but watching with\nterror the cold, cruel judge who looked mocking her out of his eyes.",
      "The cause is not that,  she said,  and, indeed, I don t see how the\ncause of my irritability, as you call it, can be that I am completely\nin your power.",
      "What indefiniteness is there in the position?",
      "on the\ncontrary....",
      "I am very sorry that you don t care to understand,  he interrupted,\nobstinately anxious to give utterance to his thought.",
      "The\nindefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free.",
      "On that score you can set your mind quite at rest,  she said, and\nturning away from him, she began drinking her coffee.",
      "She lifted her cup, with her little finger held apart, and put it to\nher lips.",
      "After drinking a few sips she glanced at him, and by his\nexpression, she saw clearly that he was repelled by her hand, and her\ngesture, and the sound made by her lips.",
      "I don t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she\nwants to make for you,  she said, putting the cup down with a shaking\nhand.",
      "But we are not talking about that.",
      "Yes, that s just what we are talking about.",
      "And let me tell you that a\nheartless woman, whether she s old or not old, your mother or anyone\nelse, is of no consequence to me, and I would not consent to know her.",
      "Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.",
      "A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son s happiness and\nhonor lie has no heart.",
      "I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my\nmother, whom I respect,  he said, raising his voice and looking sternly\nat her.",
      "She did not answer.",
      "Looking intently at him, at his face, his hands,\nshe recalled all the details of their reconciliation the previous day,\nand his passionate caresses.",
      "There, just such caresses he has\nlavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!",
      "she\nthought.",
      "You don t love your mother.",
      "That s all talk, and talk, and talk!",
      "she\nsaid, looking at him with hatred in her eyes.",
      "Even if so, you must.... \n\n Must decide, and I have decided,  she said, and she would have gone\naway, but at that moment Yashvin walked into the room.",
      "Anna greeted him\nand remained.",
      "Why, when there was a tempest in her soul, and she felt she was\nstanding at a turning point in her life, which might have fearful\nconsequences why, at that minute, she had to keep up appearances before\nan outsider, who sooner or later must know it all she did not know.",
      "But\nat once quelling the storm within her, she sat down and began talking\nto their guest.",
      "Well, how are you getting on?",
      "Has your debt been paid you?",
      "she asked\nYashvin.",
      "Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan t get it all, but I shall get a good\nhalf.",
      "And when are you off?",
      "said Yashvin, looking at Vronsky, and\nunmistakably guessing at a quarrel.",
      "The day after tomorrow, I think,  said Vronsky.",
      "You ve been meaning to go so long, though.",
      "But now it s quite decided,  said Anna, looking Vronsky straight in\nthe face with a look which told him not to dream of the possibility of\nreconciliation.",
      "Don t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?",
      "she went on, talking\nto Yashvin.",
      "I ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I m\nsorry for him or not.",
      "You see, all my fortune s here he touched his\nbreast pocket and just now I m a wealthy man.",
      "But today I m going to\nthe club, and I may come out a beggar.",
      "You see, whoever sits down to\nplay with me he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do\nI him.",
      "And so we fight it out, and that s the pleasure of it.",
      "Well, but suppose you were married,  said Anna,  how would it be for\nyour wife?",
      "Yashvin laughed.",
      "That s why I m not married, and never mean to be.",
      "And Helsingfors?",
      "said Vronsky, entering into the conversation and\nglancing at Anna s smiling face.",
      "Meeting his eyes, Anna s face\ninstantly took a coldly severe expression as though she were saying to\nhim:  It s not forgotten.",
      "It s all the same.",
      "Were you really in love?",
      "she said to Yashvin.",
      "Oh heavens!",
      "ever so many times!",
      "But you see, some men can play but\nonly so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a\n_rendezvous_ comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be\nlate for my cards in the evening.",
      "That s how I manage things.",
      "No, I didn t mean that, but the real thing.",
      "She would have said\n_Helsingfors_, but would not repeat the word used by Vronsky.",
      "Voytov, who was buying the horse, came in.",
      "Anna got up and went out of\nthe room.",
      "Before leaving the house, Vronsky went into her room.",
      "She would have\npretended to be looking for something on the table, but ashamed of\nmaking a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.",
      "What do you want?",
      "she asked in French.",
      "To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I ve sold him,  he said, in a tone\nwhich said more clearly than words,  I ve no time for discussing\nthings, and it would lead to nothing.",
      "I m not to blame in any way,  he thought.",
      "If she will punish herself,\n_tant pis pour elle._ But as he was going he fancied that she said\nsomething, and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her.",
      "Eh, Anna?",
      "he queried.",
      "I said nothing,  she answered just as coldly and calmly.",
      "Oh, nothing, _tant pis_ then,  he thought, feeling cold again, and he\nturned and went out.",
      "As he was going out he caught a glimpse in the\nlooking-glass of her face, white, with quivering lips.",
      "He even wanted\nto stop and to say some comforting word to her, but his legs carried\nhim out of the room before he could think what to say.",
      "The whole of\nthat day he spent away from home, and when he came in late in the\nevening the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and\nbegged him not to go in to her.",
      "Chapter 26\n\nNever before had a day been passed in quarrel.",
      "Today was the first\ntime.",
      "And this was not a quarrel.",
      "It was the open acknowledgment of\ncomplete coldness.",
      "Was it possible to glance at her as he had glanced\nwhen he came into the room for the guarantee?",
      "to look at her, see her\nheart was breaking with despair, and go out without a word with that\nface of callous composure?",
      "He was not merely cold to her, he hated her\nbecause he loved another woman that was clear.",
      "And remembering all the cruel words he had said, Anna supplied, too,\nthe words that he had unmistakably wished to say and could have said to\nher, and she grew more and more exasperated.",
      "I won t prevent you,  he might say.",
      "You can go where you like.",
      "You\nwere unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you\nmight go back to him.",
      "Go back to him.",
      "If you want money, I ll give it\nto you.",
      "How many roubles do you want?",
      "All the most cruel words that a brutal man could say, he said to her in\nher imagination, and she could not forgive him for them, as though he\nhad actually said them.",
      "But didn t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful and\nsincere man?",
      "Haven t I despaired for nothing many times already?",
      "she\nsaid to herself afterwards.",
      "All that day, except for the visit to Wilson s, which occupied two\nhours, Anna spent in doubts whether everything were over or whether\nthere were still hope of reconciliation, whether she should go away at\nonce or see him once more.",
      "She was expecting him the whole day, and in\nthe evening, as she went to her own room, leaving a message for him\nthat her head ached, she said to herself,  If he comes in spite of what\nthe maid says, it means that he loves me still.",
      "If not, it means that\nall is over, and then I will decide what I m to do!...",
      "In the evening she heard the rumbling of his carriage stop at the\nentrance, his ring, his steps and his conversation with the servant; he\nbelieved what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to\nhis own room.",
      "So then everything was over.",
      "And death rose clearly and vividly before her mind as the sole means of\nbringing back love for her in his heart, of punishing him and of\ngaining the victory in that strife which the evil spirit in possession\nof her heart was waging with him.",
      "Now nothing mattered: going or not going to Vozdvizhenskoe, getting or\nnot getting a divorce from her husband all that did not matter.",
      "The one\nthing that mattered was punishing him.",
      "When she poured herself out her\nusual dose of opium, and thought that she had only to drink off the\nwhole bottle to die, it seemed to her so simple and easy, that she\nbegan musing with enjoyment on how he would suffer, and repent and love\nher memory when it would be too late.",
      "She lay in bed with open eyes, by\nthe light of a single burned-down candle, gazing at the carved cornice\nof the ceiling and at the shadow of the screen that covered part of it,\nwhile she vividly pictured to herself how he would feel when she would\nbe no more, when she would be only a memory to him.",
      "How could I say\nsuch cruel things to her?",
      "he would say.",
      "How could I go out of the\nroom without saying anything to her?",
      "But now she is no more.",
      "She has\ngone away from us forever.",
      "She is....",
      "Suddenly the shadow of the\nscreen wavered, pounced on the whole cornice, the whole ceiling; other\nshadows from the other side swooped to meet it, for an instant the\nshadows flitted back, but then with fresh swiftness they darted\nforward, wavered, commingled, and all was darkness.",
      "Death!",
      "she\nthought.",
      "And such horror came upon her that for a long while she could\nnot realize where she was, and for a long while her trembling hands\ncould not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one\nthat had burned down and gone out.",
      "No, anything only to live!",
      "Why, I\nlove him!",
      "Why, he loves me!",
      "This has been before and will pass,  she\nsaid, feeling that tears of joy at the return to life were trickling\ndown her cheeks.",
      "And to escape from her panic she went hurriedly to his\nroom.",
      "He was asleep there, and sleeping soundly.",
      "She went up to him, and\nholding the light above his face, she gazed a long while at him.",
      "Now\nwhen he was asleep, she loved him so that at the sight of him she could\nnot keep back tears of tenderness.",
      "But she knew that if he waked up he\nwould look at her with cold eyes, convinced that he was right, and that\nbefore telling him of her love, she would have to prove to him that he\nhad been wrong in his treatment of her.",
      "Without waking him, she went\nback, and after a second dose of opium she fell towards morning into a\nheavy, incomplete sleep, during which she never quite lost\nconsciousness.",
      "In the morning she was waked by a horrible nightmare, which had\nrecurred several times in her dreams, even before her connection with\nVronsky.",
      "A little old man with unkempt beard was doing something bent\ndown over some iron, muttering meaningless French words, and she, as\nshe always did in this nightmare (it was what made the horror of it),\nfelt that this peasant was taking no notice of her, but was doing\nsomething horrible with the iron over her.",
      "And she waked up in a cold\nsweat.",
      "When she got up, the previous day came back to her as though veiled in\nmist.",
      "There was a quarrel.",
      "Just what has happened several times.",
      "I said I\nhad a headache, and he did not come in to see me.",
      "Tomorrow we re going\naway; I must see him and get ready for the journey,  she said to\nherself.",
      "And learning that he was in his study, she went down to him.",
      "As she passed through the drawing-room she heard a carriage stop at the\nentrance, and looking out of the window she saw the carriage, from\nwhich a young girl in a lilac hat was leaning out giving some direction\nto the footman ringing the bell.",
      "After a parley in the hall, someone\ncame upstairs, and Vronsky s steps could be heard passing the\ndrawing-room.",
      "He went rapidly downstairs.",
      "Anna went again to the\nwindow.",
      "She saw him come out onto the steps without his hat and go up\nto the carriage.",
      "The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel.",
      "Vronsky, smiling, said something to her.",
      "The carriage drove away, he\nran rapidly upstairs again.",
      "The mists that had shrouded everything in her soul parted suddenly.",
      "The\nfeelings of yesterday pierced the sick heart with a fresh pang.",
      "She\ncould not understand now how she could have lowered herself by spending\na whole day with him in his house.",
      "She went into his room to announce\nher determination.",
      "That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter.",
      "They came and brought me\nthe money and the deeds from maman.",
      "I couldn t get them yesterday.",
      "How\nis your head, better?",
      "he said quietly, not wishing to see and to\nunderstand the gloomy and solemn expression of her face.",
      "She looked silently, intently at him, standing in the middle of the\nroom.",
      "He glanced at her, frowned for a moment, and went on reading a\nletter.",
      "She turned, and went deliberately out of the room.",
      "He still\nmight have turned her back, but she had reached the door, he was still\nsilent, and the only sound audible was the rustling of the note paper\nas he turned it.",
      "Oh, by the way,  he said at the very moment she was in the doorway,\n we re going tomorrow for certain, aren t we?",
      "You, but not I,  she said, turning round to him.",
      "Anna, we can t go on like this.... \n\n You, but not I,  she repeated.",
      "This is getting unbearable!",
      "You ... you will be sorry for this,  she said, and went out.",
      "Frightened by the desperate expression with which these words were\nuttered, he jumped up and would have run after her, but on second\nthoughts he sat down and scowled, setting his teeth.",
      "This vulgar as he\nthought it threat of something vague exasperated him.",
      "I ve tried\neverything,  he thought;  the only thing left is not to pay attention, \nand he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother s\nto get her signature to the deeds.",
      "She heard the sound of his steps about the study and the dining-room.",
      "At the drawing-room he stood still.",
      "But he did not turn in to see her,\nhe merely gave an order that the horse should be given to Voytov if he\ncame while he was away.",
      "Then she heard the carriage brought round, the\ndoor opened, and he came out again.",
      "But he went back into the porch\nagain, and someone was running upstairs.",
      "It was the valet running up\nfor his gloves that had been forgotten.",
      "She went to the window and saw\nhim take the gloves without looking, and touching the coachman on the\nback he said something to him.",
      "Then without looking up at the window he\nsettled himself in his usual attitude in the carriage, with his legs\ncrossed, and drawing on his gloves he vanished round the corner.",
      "Chapter 27\n\n He has gone!",
      "It is over!",
      "Anna said to herself, standing at the\nwindow; and in answer to this statement the impression of the darkness\nwhen the candle had flickered out, and of her fearful dream mingling\ninto one, filled her heart with cold terror.",
      "No, that cannot be!",
      "she cried, and crossing the room she rang the\nbell.",
      "She was so afraid now of being alone, that without waiting for\nthe servant to come in, she went out to meet him.",
      "Inquire where the count has gone,  she said.",
      "The servant answered that\nthe count had gone to the stable.",
      "His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage would\nbe back immediately.",
      "Very good.",
      "Wait a minute.",
      "I ll write a note at once.",
      "Send Mihail with\nthe note to the stables.",
      "Make haste.",
      "She sat down and wrote:\n\n I was wrong.",
      "Come back home; I must explain.",
      "For God s sake come!",
      "I m\nafraid.",
      "She sealed it up and gave it to the servant.",
      "She was afraid of being left alone now; she followed the servant out of\nthe room, and went to the nursery.",
      "Why, this isn t it, this isn t he!",
      "Where are his blue eyes, his sweet,\nshy smile?",
      "was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy little\ngirl with her black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle\nof her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery.",
      "The little girl\nsitting at the table was obstinately and violently battering on it with\na cork, and staring aimlessly at her mother with her pitch-black eyes.",
      "Answering the English nurse that she was quite well, and that she was\ngoing to the country tomorrow, Anna sat down by the little girl and\nbegan spinning the cork to show her.",
      "But the child s loud, ringing\nlaugh, and the motion of her eyebrows, recalled Vronsky so vividly that\nshe got up hurriedly, restraining her sobs, and went away.",
      "Can it be\nall over?",
      "No, it cannot be!",
      "she thought.",
      "He will come back.",
      "But how\ncan he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to\nher?",
      "But even if he doesn t explain, I will believe.",
      "If I don t\nbelieve, there s only one thing left for me, and I can t. \n\nShe looked at her watch.",
      "Twenty minutes had passed.",
      "By now he has\nreceived the note and is coming back.",
      "Not long, ten minutes more....",
      "But what if he doesn t come?",
      "No, that cannot be.",
      "He mustn t see me with\ntear-stained eyes.",
      "I ll go and wash.",
      "Yes, yes; did I do my hair or\nnot?",
      "she asked herself.",
      "And she could not remember.",
      "She felt her head\nwith her hand.",
      "Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can t\nin the least remember.",
      "She could not believe the evidence of her hand,\nand went up to the pier-glass to see whether she really had done her\nhair.",
      "She certainly had, but she could not think when she had done it.",
      "Who s that?",
      "she thought, looking in the looking-glass at the swollen\nface with strangely glittering eyes, that looked in a scared way at\nher.",
      "Why, it s I!",
      "she suddenly understood, and looking round, she\nseemed all at once to feel his kisses on her, and twitched her\nshoulders, shuddering.",
      "Then she lifted her hand to her lips and kissed\nit.",
      "What is it?",
      "Why, I m going out of my mind!",
      "and she went into her\nbedroom, where Annushka was tidying the room.",
      "Annushka,  she said, coming to a standstill before her, and she stared\nat the maid, not knowing what to say to her.",
      "You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,  said the girl, as though\nshe understood.",
      "Darya Alexandrovna?",
      "Yes, I ll go.",
      "Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back.",
      "He s coming, he ll be\nhere soon.",
      "She took out her watch and looked at it.",
      "But how could he\ngo away, leaving me in such a state?",
      "How can he live, without making it\nup with me?",
      "She went to the window and began looking into the street.",
      "Judging by the time, he might be back now.",
      "But her calculations might\nbe wrong, and she began once more to recall when he had started and to\ncount the minutes.",
      "At the moment when she had moved away to the big clock to compare it\nwith her watch, someone drove up.",
      "Glancing out of the window, she saw\nhis carriage.",
      "But no one came upstairs, and voices could be heard\nbelow.",
      "It was the messenger who had come back in the carriage.",
      "She went\ndown to him.",
      "We didn t catch the count.",
      "The count had driven off on the lower city\nroad.",
      "What do you say?",
      "What!...",
      "she said to the rosy, good-humored Mihail,\nas he handed her back her note.",
      "Why, then, he has never received it!",
      "she thought.",
      "Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya s place, you know?",
      "and bring\nan answer back immediately,  she said to the messenger.",
      "And I, what am I going to do?",
      "she thought.",
      "Yes, I m going to\nDolly s, that s true or else I shall go out of my mind.",
      "Yes, and I can\ntelegraph, too.",
      "And she wrote a telegram.",
      "I absolutely must talk to\nyou; come at once.",
      "After sending off the telegram, she went to dress.",
      "When she was dressed and in her hat, she glanced again into the eyes of\nthe plump, comfortable-looking Annushka.",
      "There was unmistakable\nsympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes.",
      "Annushka, dear, what am I to do?",
      "said Anna, sobbing and sinking\nhelplessly into a chair.",
      "Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna?",
      "Why, there s nothing out of the\nway.",
      "You drive out a little, and it ll cheer you up,  said the maid.",
      "Yes, I m going,  said Anna, rousing herself and getting up.",
      "And if\nthere s a telegram while I m away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna s\n... but no, I shall be back myself.",
      "Yes, I mustn t think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most\nof all, get out of this house,  she said, feeling with terror the\nstrange turmoil going on in her own heart, and she made haste to go out\nand get into the carriage.",
      "Where to?",
      "asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.",
      "To Znamenka, the Oblonskys .",
      "Chapter 28\n\nIt was bright and sunny.",
      "A fine rain had been falling all the morning,\nand now it had not long cleared up.",
      "The iron roofs, the flags of the\nroads, the flints of the pavements, the wheels and leather, the brass\nand the tinplate of the carriages all glistened brightly in the May\nsunshine.",
      "It was three o clock, and the very liveliest time in the\nstreets.",
      "As she sat in a corner of the comfortable carriage, that hardly swayed\non its supple springs, while the grays trotted swiftly, in the midst of\nthe unceasing rattle of wheels and the changing impressions in the pure\nair, Anna ran over the events of the last days, and she saw her\nposition quite differently from how it had seemed at home.",
      "Now the\nthought of death seemed no longer so terrible and so clear to her, and\ndeath itself no longer seemed so inevitable.",
      "Now she blamed herself for\nthe humiliation to which she had lowered herself.",
      "I entreat him to\nforgive me.",
      "I have given in to him.",
      "I have owned myself in fault.",
      "What\nfor?",
      "Can t I live without him?",
      "And leaving unanswered the question how\nshe was going to live without him, she fell to reading the signs on the\nshops.",
      "Office and warehouse.",
      "Dental surgeon.",
      "Yes, I ll tell Dolly all\nabout it.",
      "She doesn t like Vronsky.",
      "I shall be sick and ashamed, but\nI ll tell her.",
      "She loves me, and I ll follow her advice.",
      "I won t give\nin to him; I won t let him train me as he pleases.",
      "Filippov, bun shop.",
      "They say they send their dough to Petersburg.",
      "The Moscow water is so\ngood for it.",
      "Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!",
      "And she remembered how, long, long ago, when she was a girl of\nseventeen, she had gone with her aunt to Troitsa.",
      "Riding, too.",
      "Was\nthat really me, with red hands?",
      "How much that seemed to me then\nsplendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then\nhas gone out of my reach forever!",
      "Could I ever have believed then that\nI could come to such humiliation?",
      "How conceited and self-satisfied he\nwill be when he gets my note!",
      "But I will show him.... How horrid that\npaint smells!",
      "Why is it they re always painting and building?",
      "_Modes et\nrobes_, she read.",
      "A man bowed to her.",
      "It was Annushka s husband.",
      "Our\nparasites ; she remembered how Vronsky had said that.",
      "Our?",
      "Why our?",
      "What s so awful is that one can t tear up the past by its roots.",
      "One\ncan t tear it out, but one can hide one s memory of it.",
      "And I ll hide\nit.",
      "And then she thought of her past with Alexey Alexandrovitch, of\nhow she had blotted the memory of it out of her life.",
      "Dolly will think\nI m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.",
      "As if I cared to be right!",
      "I can t help it!",
      "she said, and she wanted\nto cry.",
      "But at once she fell to wondering what those two girls could be\nsmiling about.",
      "Love, most likely.",
      "They don t know how dreary it is,\nhow low....",
      "The boulevard and the children.",
      "Three boys running, playing\nat horses.",
      "Seryozha!",
      "And I m losing everything and not getting him\nback.",
      "Yes, I m losing everything, if he doesn t return.",
      "Perhaps he was\nlate for the train and has come back by now.",
      "Longing for humiliation\nagain!",
      "she said to herself.",
      "No, I ll go to Dolly, and say straight\nout to her, I m unhappy, I deserve this, I m to blame, but still I m\nunhappy, help me.",
      "These horses, this carriage how loathsome I am to\nmyself in this carriage all his; but I won t see them again.",
      "Thinking over the words in which she would tell Dolly, and mentally\nworking her heart up to great bitterness, Anna went upstairs.",
      "Is there anyone with her?",
      "she asked in the hall.",
      "Katerina Alexandrovna Levin,  answered the footman.",
      "Kitty!",
      "Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!",
      "thought Anna,  the girl\nhe thinks of with love.",
      "He s sorry he didn t marry her.",
      "But me he\nthinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me.",
      "The sisters were having a consultation about nursing when Anna called.",
      "Dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their\nconversation.",
      "Well, so you ve not gone away yet?",
      "I meant to have come to you,  she\nsaid;  I had a letter from Stiva today.",
      "We had a telegram too,  answered Anna, looking round for Kitty.",
      "He writes that he can t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch\nwants, but he won t go away without a decisive answer.",
      "I thought you had someone with you.",
      "Can I see the letter?",
      "Yes; Kitty,  said Dolly, embarrassed.",
      "She stayed in the nursery.",
      "She\nhas been very ill.",
      "So I heard.",
      "May I see the letter?",
      "I ll get it directly.",
      "But he doesn t refuse; on the contrary, Stiva\nhas hopes,  said Dolly, stopping in the doorway.",
      "I haven t, and indeed I don t wish it,  said Anna.",
      "What s this?",
      "Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?",
      "thought\nAnna when she was alone.",
      "Perhaps she s right, too.",
      "But it s not for\nher, the girl who was in love with Vronsky, it s not for her to show me\nthat, even if it is true.",
      "I know that in my position I can t be\nreceived by any decent woman.",
      "I knew that from the first moment I\nsacrificed everything to him.",
      "And this is my reward!",
      "Oh, how I hate\nhim!",
      "And what did I come here for?",
      "I m worse here, more miserable.",
      "She\nheard from the next room the sisters  voices in consultation.",
      "And what\nam I going to say to Dolly now?",
      "Amuse Kitty by the sight of my\nwretchedness, submit to her patronizing?",
      "No; and besides, Dolly\nwouldn t understand.",
      "And it would be no good my telling her.",
      "It would\nonly be interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone\nand everything, how nothing matters to me now.",
      "Dolly came in with the letter.",
      "Anna read it and handed it back in\nsilence.",
      "I knew all that,  she said,  and it doesn t interest me in the least.",
      "Oh, why so?",
      "On the contrary, I have hopes,  said Dolly, looking\ninquisitively at Anna.",
      "She had never seen her in such a strangely\nirritable condition.",
      "When are you going away?",
      "she asked.",
      "Anna, half-closing her eyes, looked straight before her and did not\nanswer.",
      "Why does Kitty shrink from me?",
      "she said, looking at the door and\nflushing red.",
      "Oh, what nonsense!",
      "She s nursing, and things aren t going right with\nher, and I ve been advising her.... She s delighted.",
      "She ll be here in\na minute,  said Dolly awkwardly, not clever at lying.",
      "Yes, here she\nis.",
      "Hearing that Anna had called, Kitty had wanted not to appear, but Dolly\npersuaded her.",
      "Rallying her forces, Kitty went in, walked up to her,\nblushing, and shook hands.",
      "I am so glad to see you,  she said with a trembling voice.",
      "Kitty had been thrown into confusion by the inward conflict between her\nantagonism to this bad woman and her desire to be nice to her.",
      "But as\nsoon as she saw Anna s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of\nantagonism disappeared.",
      "I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me.",
      "I m\nused to everything.",
      "You have been ill?",
      "Yes, you are changed,  said\nAnna.",
      "Kitty felt that Anna was looking at her with hostile eyes.",
      "She ascribed\nthis hostility to the awkward position in which Anna, who had once\npatronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.",
      "They talked of Kitty s illness, of the baby, of Stiva, but it was\nobvious that nothing interested Anna.",
      "I came to say good-bye to you,  she said, getting up.",
      "Oh, when are you going?",
      "But again not answering, Anna turned to Kitty.",
      "Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,  she said with a smile.",
      "I have\nheard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband.",
      "He came to\nsee me, and I liked him exceedingly,  she said, unmistakably with\nmalicious intent.",
      "Where is he?",
      "He has gone back to the country,  said Kitty, blushing.",
      "Remember me to him, be sure you do.",
      "I ll be sure to!",
      "Kitty said na vely, looking compassionately into her\neyes.",
      "So good-bye, Dolly.",
      "And kissing Dolly and shaking hands with Kitty,\nAnna went out hurriedly.",
      "She s just the same and just as charming!",
      "She s very lovely!",
      "said\nKitty, when she was alone with her sister.",
      "But there s something\npiteous about her.",
      "Awfully piteous!",
      "Yes, there s something unusual about her today,  said Dolly.",
      "When I\nwent with her into the hall, I fancied she was almost crying.",
      "Chapter 29\n\nAnna got into the carriage again in an even worse frame of mind than\nwhen she set out from home.",
      "To her previous tortures was added now that\nsense of mortification and of being an outcast which she had felt so\ndistinctly on meeting Kitty.",
      "Where to?",
      "Home?",
      "asked Pyotr.",
      "Yes, home,  she said, not even thinking now where she was going.",
      "How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and\ncurious!",
      "What can he be telling the other with such warmth?",
      "she\nthought, staring at two men who walked by.",
      "Can one ever tell anyone\nwhat one is feeling?",
      "I meant to tell Dolly, and it s a good thing I\ndidn t tell her.",
      "How pleased she would have been at my misery!",
      "She\nwould have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight\nat my being punished for the happiness she envied me for.",
      "Kitty, she\nwould have been even more pleased.",
      "How I can see through her!",
      "She knows\nI was more than usually sweet to her husband.",
      "And she s jealous and\nhates me.",
      "And she despises me.",
      "In her eyes I m an immoral woman.",
      "If I\nwere an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with\nme ... if I d cared to.",
      "And, indeed, I did care to.",
      "There s someone\nwho s pleased with himself,  she thought, as she saw a fat, rubicund\ngentleman coming towards her.",
      "He took her for an acquaintance, and\nlifted his glossy hat above his bald, glossy head, and then perceived\nhis mistake.",
      "He thought he knew me.",
      "Well, he knows me as well as\nanyone in the world knows me.",
      "I don t know myself.",
      "I know my appetites,\nas the French say.",
      "They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know\nfor certain,  she thought, looking at two boys stopping an ice cream\nseller, who took a barrel off his head and began wiping his perspiring\nface with a towel.",
      "We all want what is sweet and nice.",
      "If not\nsweetmeats, then a dirty ice.",
      "And Kitty s the same if not Vronsky, then\nLevin.",
      "And she envies me, and hates me.",
      "And we all hate each other.",
      "I\nKitty, Kitty me.",
      "Yes, that s the truth.",
      "_Tiutkin, coiffeur._  _Je me\nfais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I ll tell him that when he comes,  she\nthought and smiled.",
      "But the same instant she remembered that she had no\none now to tell anything amusing to.",
      "And there s nothing amusing,\nnothing mirthful, really.",
      "It s all hateful.",
      "They re singing for\nvespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses himself!",
      "as if he were\nafraid of missing something.",
      "Why these churches and this singing and\nthis humbug?",
      "Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these\ncab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily.",
      "Yashvin says,  He\nwants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.",
      "Yes, that s the\ntruth!",
      "She was plunged in these thoughts, which so engrossed her that she left\noff thinking of her own position, when the carriage drew up at the\nsteps of her house.",
      "It was only when she saw the porter running out to\nmeet her that she remembered she had sent the note and the telegram.",
      "Is there an answer?",
      "she inquired.",
      "I ll see this minute,  answered the porter, and glancing into his\nroom, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram.",
      "I can t come before ten o clock.",
      "Vronsky,  she read.",
      "And hasn t the messenger come back?",
      "No,  answered the porter.",
      "Then, since it s so, I know what I must do,  she said, and feeling a\nvague fury and craving for revenge rising up within her, she ran\nupstairs.",
      "I ll go to him myself.",
      "Before going away forever, I ll tell\nhim all.",
      "Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!",
      "she thought.",
      "Seeing his hat on the rack, she shuddered with aversion.",
      "She did not\nconsider that his telegram was an answer to her telegram and that he\nhad not yet received her note.",
      "She pictured him to herself as talking\ncalmly to his mother and Princess Sorokina and rejoicing at her\nsufferings.",
      "Yes, I must go quickly,  she said, not knowing yet where\nshe was going.",
      "She longed to get away as quickly as possible from the\nfeelings she had gone through in that awful house.",
      "The servants, the\nwalls, the things in that house all aroused repulsion and hatred in her\nand lay like a weight upon her.",
      "Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he s not there, then go\nthere and catch him.",
      "Anna looked at the railway timetable in the\nnewspapers.",
      "An evening train went at two minutes past eight.",
      "Yes, I\nshall be in time.",
      "She gave orders for the other horses to be put in\nthe carriage, and packed in a traveling-bag the things needed for a few\ndays.",
      "She knew she would never come back here again.",
      "Among the plans that came into her head she vaguely determined that\nafter what would happen at the station or at the countess s house, she\nwould go as far as the first town on the Nizhni road and stop there.",
      "Dinner was on the table; she went up, but the smell of the bread and\ncheese was enough to make her feel that all food was disgusting.",
      "She\nordered the carriage and went out.",
      "The house threw a shadow now right\nacross the street, but it was a bright evening and still warm in the\nsunshine.",
      "Annushka, who came down with her things, and Pyotr, who put\nthe things in the carriage, and the coachman, evidently out of humor,\nwere all hateful to her, and irritated her by their words and actions.",
      "I don t want you, Pyotr.",
      "But how about the ticket?",
      "Well, as you like, it doesn t matter,  she said crossly.",
      "Pyotr jumped on the box, and putting his arms akimbo, told the coachman\nto drive to the booking-office.",
      "Chapter 30\n\n Here it is again!",
      "Again I understand it all!",
      "Anna said to herself, as\nsoon as the carriage had started and swaying lightly, rumbled over the\ntiny cobbles of the paved road, and again one impression followed\nrapidly upon another.",
      "Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?",
      "she tried to\nrecall it.",
      "_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_ no, not that.",
      "Yes, of what Yashvin\nsays, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds\nmen together.",
      "No, it s a useless journey you re making,  she said,\nmentally addressing a party in a coach and four, evidently going for an\nexcursion into the country.",
      "And the dog you re taking with you will be\nno help to you.",
      "You can t get away from yourselves.",
      "Turning her eyes\nin the direction Pyotr had turned to look, she saw a factory-hand\nalmost dead-drunk, with hanging head, being led away by a policeman.",
      "Come, he s found a quicker way,  she thought.",
      "Count Vronsky and I did\nnot find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.",
      "And now for the first time Anna turned that glaring light in which she\nwas seeing everything on to her relations with him, which she had\nhitherto avoided thinking about.",
      "What was it he sought in me?",
      "Not love\nso much as the satisfaction of vanity.",
      "She remembered his words, the\nexpression of his face, that recalled an abject setter-dog, in the\nearly days of their connection.",
      "And everything now confirmed this.",
      "Yes, there was the triumph of success in him.",
      "Of course there was love\ntoo, but the chief element was the pride of success.",
      "He boasted of me.",
      "Now that s over.",
      "There s nothing to be proud of.",
      "Not to be proud of,\nbut to be ashamed of.",
      "He has taken from me all he could, and now I am\nno use to him.",
      "He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable\nin his behavior to me.",
      "He let that out yesterday he wants divorce and\nmarriage so as to burn his ships.",
      "He loves me, but how?",
      "The zest is\ngone, as the English say.",
      "That fellow wants everyone to admire him and\nis very much pleased with himself,  she thought, looking at a red-faced\nclerk, riding on a riding-school horse.",
      "Yes, there s not the same\nflavor about me for him now.",
      "If I go away from him, at the bottom of\nhis heart he will be glad.",
      "This was not mere supposition, she saw it distinctly in the piercing\nlight, which revealed to her now the meaning of life and human\nrelations.",
      "My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is\nwaning and waning, and that s why we re drifting apart.",
      "She went on\nmusing.",
      "And there s no help for it.",
      "He is everything for me, and I\nwant him more and more to give himself up to me entirely.",
      "And he wants\nmore and more to get away from me.",
      "We walked to meet each other up to\nthe time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in\ndifferent directions.",
      "And there s no altering that.",
      "He tells me I m\ninsanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous;\nbut it s not true.",
      "I m not jealous, but I m unsatisfied.",
      "But....  she\nopened her lips, and shifted her place in the carriage in the\nexcitement, aroused by the thought that suddenly struck her.",
      "If I\ncould be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but\nhis caresses; but I can t and I don t care to be anything else.",
      "And by\nthat desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it\ncannot be different.",
      "Don t I know that he wouldn t deceive me, that he\nhas no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he s not in love with\nKitty, that he won t desert me!",
      "I know all that, but it makes it no\nbetter for me.",
      "If without loving me, from _duty_ he ll be good and kind\nto me, without what I want, that s a thousand times worse than\nunkindness!",
      "That s hell!",
      "And that s just how it is.",
      "For a long while\nnow he hasn t loved me.",
      "And where love ends, hate begins.",
      "I don t know\nthese streets at all.",
      "Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses....\nAnd in the houses always people and people.... How many of them, no\nend, and all hating each other!",
      "Come, let me try and think what I want,\nto make me happy.",
      "Well?",
      "Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey\nAlexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.",
      "Thinking of\nAlexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with extraordinary\nvividness as though he were alive before her, with his mild, lifeless,\ndull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his intonations and the\ncracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling which had existed\nbetween them, and which was also called love, she shuddered with\nloathing.",
      "Well, I m divorced, and become Vronsky s wife.",
      "Well, will\nKitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today?",
      "No.",
      "And will\nSeryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands?",
      "And is\nthere any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and me?",
      "Is there\npossible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery?",
      "No, no!",
      "she\nanswered now without the slightest hesitation.",
      "Impossible!",
      "We are\ndrawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and\nthere s no altering him or me.",
      "Every attempt has been made, the screw\nhas come unscrewed.",
      "Oh, a beggar woman with a baby.",
      "She thinks I m\nsorry for her.",
      "Aren t we all flung into the world only to hate each\nother, and so to torture ourselves and each other?",
      "Schoolboys\ncoming laughing Seryozha?",
      "she thought.",
      "I thought, too, that I loved\nhim, and used to be touched by my own tenderness.",
      "But I have lived\nwithout him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the\nexchange till that love was satisfied.",
      "And with loathing she thought\nof what she meant by that love.",
      "And the clearness with which she saw\nlife now, her own and all men s, was a pleasure to her.",
      "It s so with\nme and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the\npeople living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go,\nand everywhere and always,  she thought when she had driven under the\nlow-pitched roof of the Nizhigorod station, and the porters ran to meet\nher.",
      "A ticket to Obiralovka?",
      "said Pyotr.",
      "She had utterly forgotten where and why she was going, and only by a\ngreat effort she understood the question.",
      "Yes,  she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in\nher hand, she got out of the carriage.",
      "Making her way through the crowd to the first-class waiting-room, she\ngradually recollected all the details of her position, and the plans\nbetween which she was hesitating.",
      "And again at the old sore places,\nhope and then despair poisoned the wounds of her tortured, fearfully\nthrobbing heart.",
      "As she sat on the star-shaped sofa waiting for the\ntrain, she gazed with aversion at the people coming and going (they\nwere all hateful to her), and thought how she would arrive at the\nstation, would write him a note, and what she would write to him, and\nhow he was at this moment complaining to his mother of his position,\nnot understanding her sufferings, and how she would go into the room,\nand what she would say to him.",
      "Then she thought that life might still\nbe happy, and how miserably she loved and hated him, and how fearfully\nher heart was beating.",
      "Chapter 31\n\nA bell rang, some young men, ugly and impudent, and at the same time\ncareful of the impression they were making, hurried by.",
      "Pyotr, too,\ncrossed the room in his livery and top-boots, with his dull, animal\nface, and came up to her to take her to the train.",
      "Some noisy men were\nquiet as she passed them on the platform, and one whispered something\nabout her to another something vile, no doubt.",
      "She stepped up on the\nhigh step, and sat down in a carriage by herself on a dirty seat that\nhad been white.",
      "Her bag lay beside her, shaken up and down by the\nspringiness of the seat.",
      "With a foolish smile Pyotr raised his hat,\nwith its colored band, at the window, in token of farewell; an impudent\nconductor slammed the door and the latch.",
      "A grotesque-looking lady\nwearing a bustle (Anna mentally undressed the woman, and was appalled\nat her hideousness), and a little girl laughing affectedly ran down the\nplatform.",
      "Katerina Andreevna, she s got them all, _ma tante!_  cried the girl.",
      "Even the child s hideous and affected,  thought Anna.",
      "To avoid seeing\nanyone, she got up quickly and seated herself at the opposite window of\nthe empty carriage.",
      "A misshapen-looking peasant covered with dirt, in a\ncap from which his tangled hair stuck out all round, passed by that\nwindow, stooping down to the carriage wheels.",
      "There s something\nfamiliar about that hideous peasant,  thought Anna.",
      "And remembering her\ndream, she moved away to the opposite door, shaking with terror.",
      "The\nconductor opened the door and let in a man and his wife.",
      "Do you wish to get out?",
      "Anna made no answer.",
      "The conductor and her two fellow-passengers did\nnot notice under her veil her panic-stricken face.",
      "She went back to her\ncorner and sat down.",
      "The couple seated themselves on the opposite side,\nand intently but surreptitiously scrutinized her clothes.",
      "Both husband\nand wife seemed repulsive to Anna.",
      "The husband asked, would she allow\nhim to smoke, obviously not with a view to smoking but to getting into\nconversation with her.",
      "Receiving her assent, he said to his wife in\nFrench something about caring less to smoke than to talk.",
      "They made\ninane and affected remarks to one another, entirely for her benefit.",
      "Anna saw clearly that they were sick of each other, and hated each\nother.",
      "And no one could have helped hating such miserable\nmonstrosities.",
      "A second bell sounded, and was followed by moving of luggage, noise,\nshouting and laughter.",
      "It was so clear to Anna that there was nothing\nfor anyone to be glad of, that this laughter irritated her agonizingly,\nand she would have liked to stop up her ears not to hear it.",
      "At last\nthe third bell rang, there was a whistle and a hiss of steam, and a\nclank of chains, and the man in her carriage crossed himself.",
      "It would\nbe interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,  thought\nAnna, looking angrily at him.",
      "She looked past the lady out of the\nwindow at the people who seemed whirling by as they ran beside the\ntrain or stood on the platform.",
      "The train, jerking at regular intervals\nat the junctions of the rails, rolled by the platform, past a stone\nwall, a signal-box, past other trains; the wheels, moving more smoothly\nand evenly, resounded with a slight clang on the rails.",
      "The window was\nlighted up by the bright evening sun, and a slight breeze fluttered the\ncurtain.",
      "Anna forgot her fellow passengers, and to the light swaying of\nthe train she fell to thinking again, as she breathed the fresh air.",
      "Yes, what did I stop at?",
      "That I couldn t conceive a position in which\nlife would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable,\nand that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.",
      "And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?",
      "That s what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him, \nsaid the lady in French, lisping affectedly, and obviously pleased with\nher phrase.",
      "The words seemed an answer to Anna s thoughts.",
      "To escape from what worries him,  repeated Anna.",
      "And glancing at the\nred-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife\nconsidered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and\nencouraged her in that idea of herself.",
      "Anna seemed to see all their\nhistory and all the crannies of their souls, as it were turning a light\nupon them.",
      "But there was nothing interesting in them, and she pursued\nher thought.",
      "Yes, I m very much worried, and that s what reason was given me for,\nto escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when\nthere s nothing more to look at, when it s sickening to look at it all?",
      "But how?",
      "Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they\nshrieking, those young men in that train?",
      "why are they talking, why are\nthey laughing?",
      "It s all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all\ncruelty!...",
      "When the train came into the station, Anna got out into the crowd of\npassengers, and moving apart from them as if they were lepers, she\nstood on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for, and\nwhat she meant to do.",
      "Everything that had seemed to her possible before\nwas now so difficult to consider, especially in this noisy crowd of\nhideous people who would not leave her alone.",
      "One moment porters ran up\nto her proffering their services, then young men, clacking their heels\non the planks of the platform and talking loudly, stared at her; people\nmeeting her dodged past on the wrong side.",
      "Remembering that she had\nmeant to go on further if there were no answer, she stopped a porter\nand asked if her coachman were not here with a note from Count Vronsky.",
      "Count Vronsky?",
      "They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute,\nto meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter.",
      "And what is the coachman\nlike?",
      "Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and\ncheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so\nsuccessfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a\nletter.",
      "She broke it open, and her heart ached before she had read it.",
      "I am very sorry your note did not reach me.",
      "I will be home at ten, \nVronsky had written carelessly....",
      "Yes, that s what I expected!",
      "she said to herself with an evil smile.",
      "Very good, you can go home then,  she said softly, addressing Mihail.",
      "She spoke softly because the rapidity of her heart s beating hindered\nher breathing.",
      "No, I won t let you make me miserable,  she thought\nmenacingly, addressing not him, not herself, but the power that made\nher suffer, and she walked along the platform.",
      "Two maid-servants walking along the platform turned their heads,\nstaring at her and making some remarks about her dress.",
      "Real,  they\nsaid of the lace she was wearing.",
      "The young men would not leave her in\npeace.",
      "Again they passed by, peering into her face, and with a laugh\nshouting something in an unnatural voice.",
      "The station-master coming up\nasked her whether she was going by train.",
      "A boy selling kvas never took\nhis eyes off her.",
      "My God!",
      "where am I to go?",
      "she thought, going\nfarther and farther along the platform.",
      "At the end she stopped.",
      "Some\nladies and children, who had come to meet a gentleman in spectacles,\npaused in their loud laughter and talking, and stared at her as she\nreached them.",
      "She quickened her pace and walked away from them to the\nedge of the platform.",
      "A luggage train was coming in.",
      "The platform began\nto sway, and she fancied she was in the train again.",
      "And all at once she thought of the man crushed by the train the day she\nhad first met Vronsky, and she knew what she had to do.",
      "With a rapid,\nlight step she went down the steps that led from the tank to the rails\nand stopped quite near the approaching train.",
      "She looked at the lower part of the carriages, at the screws and chains\nand the tall cast-iron wheel of the first carriage slowly moving up,\nand trying to measure the middle between the front and back wheels, and\nthe very minute when that middle point would be opposite her.",
      "There,  she said to herself, looking into the shadow of the carriage,\nat the sand and coal dust which covered the sleepers there, in the\nvery middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from\nmyself.",
      "She tried to fling herself below the wheels of the first carriage as it\nreached her; but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand\ndelayed her, and she was too late; she missed the moment.",
      "She had to\nwait for the next carriage.",
      "A feeling such as she had known when about\nto take the first plunge in bathing came upon her, and she crossed\nherself.",
      "That familiar gesture brought back into her soul a whole\nseries of girlish and childish memories, and suddenly the darkness that\nhad covered everything for her was torn apart, and life rose up before\nher for an instant with all its bright past joys.",
      "But she did not take\nher eyes from the wheels of the second carriage.",
      "And exactly at the\nmoment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped\nthe red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her\nhands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again\nat once, dropped on to her knees.",
      "And at the same instant she was\nterror-stricken at what she was doing.",
      "Where am I?",
      "What am I doing?",
      "What for?",
      "She tried to get up, to drop backwards; but something huge\nand merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back.",
      "Lord,\nforgive me all!",
      "she said, feeling it impossible to struggle.",
      "A peasant\nmuttering something was working at the iron above her.",
      "And the light by\nwhich she had read the book filled with troubles, falsehoods, sorrow,\nand evil, flared up more brightly than ever before, lighted up for her\nall that had been in darkness, flickered, began to grow dim, and was\nquenched forever.",
      "PART EIGHT\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nAlmost two months had passed.",
      "The hot summer was half over, but Sergey\nIvanovitch was only just preparing to leave Moscow.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch s life had not been uneventful during this time.",
      "A\nyear ago he had finished his book, the fruit of six years  labor,\n Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe\nand Russia.",
      "Several sections of this book and its introduction had\nappeared in periodical publications, and other parts had been read by\nSergey Ivanovitch to persons of his circle, so that the leading ideas\nof the work could not be completely novel to the public.",
      "But still\nSergey Ivanovitch had expected that on its appearance his book would be\nsure to make a serious impression on society, and if it did not cause a\nrevolution in social science it would, at any rate, make a great stir\nin the scientific world.",
      "After the most conscientious revision the book had last year been\npublished, and had been distributed among the booksellers.",
      "Though he asked no one about it, reluctantly and with feigned\nindifference answered his friends  inquiries as to how the book was\ngoing, and did not even inquire of the booksellers how the book was\nselling, Sergey Ivanovitch was all on the alert, with strained\nattention, watching for the first impression his book would make in the\nworld and in literature.",
      "But a week passed, a second, a third, and in society no impression\nwhatever could be detected.",
      "His friends who were specialists and\nsavants, occasionally unmistakably from politeness alluded to it.",
      "The\nrest of his acquaintances, not interested in a book on a learned\nsubject, did not talk of it at all.",
      "And society generally just now\nespecially absorbed in other things was absolutely indifferent.",
      "In the\npress, too, for a whole month there was not a word about his book.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch had calculated to a nicety the time necessary for\nwriting a review, but a month passed, and a second, and still there was\nsilence.",
      "Only in the _Northern Beetle_, in a comic article on the singer\nDrabanti, who had lost his voice, there was a contemptuous allusion to\nKoznishev s book, suggesting that the book had been long ago seen\nthrough by everyone, and was a subject of general ridicule.",
      "At last in the third month a critical article appeared in a serious\nreview.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch knew the author of the article.",
      "He had met\nhim once at Golubtsov s.\n\nThe author of the article was a young man, an invalid, very bold as a\nwriter, but extremely deficient in breeding and shy in personal\nrelations.",
      "In spite of his absolute contempt for the author, it was with complete\nrespect that Sergey Ivanovitch set about reading the article.",
      "The\narticle was awful.",
      "The critic had undoubtedly put an interpretation upon the book which\ncould not possibly be put on it.",
      "But he had selected quotations so\nadroitly that for people who had not read the book (and obviously\nscarcely anyone had read it) it seemed absolutely clear that the whole\nbook was nothing but a medley of high-flown phrases, not even as\nsuggested by marks of interrogation used appropriately, and that the\nauthor of the book was a person absolutely without knowledge of the\nsubject.",
      "And all this was so wittily done that Sergey Ivanovitch would\nnot have disowned such wit himself.",
      "But that was just what was so\nawful.",
      "In spite of the scrupulous conscientiousness with which Sergey\nIvanovitch verified the correctness of the critic s arguments, he did\nnot for a minute stop to ponder over the faults and mistakes which were\nridiculed; but unconsciously he began immediately trying to recall\nevery detail of his meeting and conversation with the author of the\narticle.",
      "Didn t I offend him in some way?",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch wondered.",
      "And remembering that when they met he had corrected the young man about\nsomething he had said that betrayed ignorance, Sergey Ivanovitch found\nthe clue to explain the article.",
      "This article was followed by a deadly silence about the book both in\nthe press and in conversation, and Sergey Ivanovitch saw that his six\nyears  task, toiled at with such love and labor, had gone, leaving no\ntrace.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch s position was still more difficult from the fact\nthat, since he had finished his book, he had had no more literary work\nto do, such as had hitherto occupied the greater part of his time.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch was clever, cultivated, healthy, and energetic, and\nhe did not know what use to make of his energy.",
      "Conversations in\ndrawing-rooms, in meetings, assemblies, and committees everywhere where\ntalk was possible took up part of his time.",
      "But being used for years to\ntown life, he did not waste all his energies in talk, as his less\nexperienced younger brother did, when he was in Moscow.",
      "He had a great\ndeal of leisure and intellectual energy still to dispose of.",
      "Fortunately for him, at this period so difficult for him from the\nfailure of his book, the various public questions of the dissenting\nsects, of the American alliance, of the Samara famine, of exhibitions,\nand of spiritualism, were definitely replaced in public interest by the\nSlavonic question, which had hitherto rather languidly interested\nsociety, and Sergey Ivanovitch, who had been one of the first to raise\nthis subject, threw himself into it heart and soul.",
      "In the circle to which Sergey Ivanovitch belonged, nothing was talked\nof or written about just now but the Servian War.",
      "Everything that the\nidle crowd usually does to kill time was done now for the benefit of\nthe Slavonic States.",
      "Balls, concerts, dinners, matchboxes, ladies \ndresses, beer, restaurants everything testified to sympathy with the\nSlavonic peoples.",
      "From much of what was spoken and written on the subject, Sergey\nIvanovitch differed on various points.",
      "He saw that the Slavonic\nquestion had become one of those fashionable distractions which succeed\none another in providing society with an object and an occupation.",
      "He\nsaw, too, that a great many people were taking up the subject from\nmotives of self-interest and self-advertisement.",
      "He recognized that the\nnewspapers published a great deal that was superfluous and exaggerated,\nwith the sole aim of attracting attention and outbidding one another.",
      "He saw that in this general movement those who thrust themselves most\nforward and shouted the loudest were men who had failed and were\nsmarting under a sense of injury generals without armies, ministers not\nin the ministry, journalists not on any paper, party leaders without\nfollowers.",
      "He saw that there was a great deal in it that was frivolous\nand absurd.",
      "But he saw and recognized an unmistakable growing\nenthusiasm, uniting all classes, with which it was impossible not to\nsympathize.",
      "The massacre of men who were fellow Christians, and of the\nsame Slavonic race, excited sympathy for the sufferers and indignation\nagainst the oppressors.",
      "And the heroism of the Servians and\nMontenegrins struggling for a great cause begot in the whole people a\nlonging to help their brothers not in word but in deed.",
      "But in this there was another aspect that rejoiced Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "That was the manifestation of public opinion.",
      "The public had definitely\nexpressed its desire.",
      "The soul of the people had, as Sergey Ivanovitch\nsaid, found expression.",
      "And the more he worked in this cause, the more\nincontestable it seemed to him that it was a cause destined to assume\nvast dimensions, to create an epoch.",
      "He threw himself heart and soul into the service of this great cause,\nand forgot to think about his book.",
      "His whole time now was engrossed by\nit, so that he could scarcely manage to answer all the letters and\nappeals addressed to him.",
      "He worked the whole spring and part of the\nsummer, and it was only in July that he prepared to go away to his\nbrother s in the country.",
      "He was going both to rest for a fortnight, and in the very heart of the\npeople, in the farthest wilds of the country, to enjoy the sight of\nthat uplifting of the spirit of the people, of which, like all\nresidents in the capital and big towns, he was fully persuaded.",
      "Katavasov had long been meaning to carry out his promise to stay with\nLevin, and so he was going with him.",
      "Chapter 2\n\nSergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had only just reached the station of\nthe Kursk line, which was particularly busy and full of people that\nday, when, looking round for the groom who was following with their\nthings, they saw a party of volunteers driving up in four cabs.",
      "Ladies\nmet them with bouquets of flowers, and followed by the rushing crowd\nthey went into the station.",
      "One of the ladies, who had met the volunteers, came out of the hall and\naddressed Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "You too come to see them off?",
      "she asked in French.",
      "No, I m going away myself, princess.",
      "To my brother s for a holiday.",
      "Do\nyou always see them off?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch with a hardly\nperceptible smile.",
      "Oh, that would be impossible!",
      "answered the princess.",
      "Is it true that\neight hundred have been sent from us already?",
      "Malvinsky wouldn t\nbelieve me.",
      "More than eight hundred.",
      "If you reckon those who have been sent not\ndirectly from Moscow, over a thousand,  answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "There!",
      "That s just what I said!",
      "exclaimed the lady.",
      "And it s true\ntoo, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?",
      "Yes, princess.",
      "What do you say to today s telegram?",
      "Beaten the Turks again.",
      "Yes, so I saw,  answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "They were speaking of the\nlast telegram stating that the Turks had been for three days in\nsuccession beaten at all points and put to flight, and that tomorrow a\ndecisive engagement was expected.",
      "Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and\nthey ve made some difficulty, I don t know why.",
      "I meant to ask you; I\nknow him; please write a note about his case.",
      "He s being sent by\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch asked for all the details the princess knew about the\nyoung man, and going into the first-class waiting-room, wrote a note to\nthe person on whom the granting of leave of absence depended, and\nhanded it to the princess.",
      "You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?",
      "said the princess with a smile full of triumph and meaning, when he\nfound her again and gave her the letter.",
      "I had heard he was going, but I did not know when.",
      "By this train?",
      "I ve seen him.",
      "He s here: there s only his mother seeing him off.",
      "It s\nthe best thing, anyway, that he could do.",
      "Oh, yes, of course.",
      "While they were talking the crowd streamed by them into the\ndining-room.",
      "They went forward too, and heard a gentleman with a glass\nin his hand delivering a loud discourse to the volunteers.",
      "In the\nservice of religion, humanity, and our brothers,  the gentleman said,\nhis voice growing louder and louder;  to this great cause mother Moscow\ndedicates you with her blessing.",
      "_Jivio!_  he concluded, loudly and\ntearfully.",
      "Everyone shouted _Jivio!_ and a fresh crowd dashed into the hall,\nalmost carrying the princess off her legs.",
      "Ah, princess!",
      "that was something like!",
      "said Stepan Arkadyevitch,\nsuddenly appearing in the middle of the crowd and beaming upon them\nwith a delighted smile.",
      "Capitally, warmly said, wasn t it?",
      "Bravo!",
      "And\nSergey Ivanovitch!",
      "Why, you ought to have said something just a few\nwords, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well,  he added with\na soft, respectful, and discreet smile, moving Sergey Ivanovitch\nforward a little by the arm.",
      "No, I m just off.",
      "Where to?",
      "To the country, to my brother s,  answered Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Then you ll see my wife.",
      "I ve written to her, but you ll see her\nfirst.",
      "Please tell her that they ve seen me and that it s  all right, \nas the English say.",
      "She ll understand.",
      "Oh, and be so good as to tell\nher I m appointed secretary of the committee....",
      "But she ll understand!",
      "You know, _les petites mis res de la vie humaine,_  he said, as it were\napologizing to the princess.",
      "And Princess Myakaya not Liza, but\nBibish is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses.",
      "Did I tell you?",
      "Yes, I heard so,  answered Koznishev indifferently.",
      "It s a pity you re going away,  said Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Tomorrow\nwe re giving a dinner to two who re setting off Dimer-Bartnyansky from\nPetersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha.",
      "They re both going.",
      "Veslovsky s\nonly lately married.",
      "There s a fine fellow for you!",
      "Eh, princess?",
      "he\nturned to the lady.",
      "The princess looked at Koznishev without replying.",
      "But the fact that\nSergey Ivanovitch and the princess seemed anxious to get rid of him did\nnot in the least disconcert Stepan Arkadyevitch.",
      "Smiling, he stared at\nthe feather in the princess s hat, and then about him as though he were\ngoing to pick something up.",
      "Seeing a lady approaching with a collecting\nbox, he beckoned her up and put in a five-rouble note.",
      "I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I ve money in my\npocket,  he said.",
      "And how about today s telegram?",
      "Fine chaps those\nMontenegrins!",
      "You don t say so!",
      "he cried, when the princess told him that Vronsky\nwas going by this train.",
      "For an instant Stepan Arkadyevitch s face\nlooked sad, but a minute later, when, stroking his mustaches and\nswinging as he walked, he went into the hall where Vronsky was, he had\ncompletely forgotten his own despairing sobs over his sister s corpse,\nand he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.",
      "With all his faults one can t refuse to do him justice,  said the\nprincess to Sergey Ivanovitch as soon as Stepan Arkadyevitch had left\nthem.",
      "What a typically Russian, Slav nature!",
      "Only, I m afraid it won t\nbe pleasant for Vronsky to see him.",
      "Say what you will, I m touched by\nthat man s fate.",
      "Do talk to him a little on the way,  said the\nprincess.",
      "Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.",
      "I never liked him.",
      "But this atones for a great deal.",
      "He s not merely\ngoing himself, he s taking a squadron at his own expense.",
      "Yes, so I heard.",
      "A bell sounded.",
      "Everyone crowded to the doors.",
      "Here he is!",
      "said the\nprincess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by,\nwearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat.",
      "Oblonsky was\nwalking beside him, talking eagerly of something.",
      "Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him, as though he did\nnot hear what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying.",
      "Probably on Oblonsky s pointing them out, he looked round in the\ndirection where the princess and Sergey Ivanovitch were standing, and\nwithout speaking lifted his hat.",
      "His face, aged and worn by suffering,\nlooked stony.",
      "Going onto the platform, Vronsky left his mother and disappeared into a\ncompartment.",
      "On the platform there rang out  God save the Tsar,  then shouts of\n hurrah!",
      "and _ jivio!",
      "_ One of the volunteers, a tall, very young man\nwith a hollow chest, was particularly conspicuous, bowing and waving\nhis felt hat and a nosegay over his head.",
      "Then two officers emerged,\nbowing too, and a stout man with a big beard, wearing a greasy forage\ncap.",
      "Chapter 3\n\nSaying good-bye to the princess, Sergey Ivanovitch was joined by\nKatavasov; together they got into a carriage full to overflowing, and\nthe train started.",
      "At Tsaritsino station the train was met by a chorus of young men\nsinging  Hail to Thee!",
      "Again the volunteers bowed and poked their\nheads out, but Sergey Ivanovitch paid no attention to them.",
      "He had had\nso much to do with the volunteers that the type was familiar to him and\ndid not interest him.",
      "Katavasov, whose scientific work had prevented\nhis having a chance of observing them hitherto, was very much\ninterested in them and questioned Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to go into the second-class and talk to\nthem himself.",
      "At the next station Katavasov acted on this suggestion.",
      "At the first stop he moved into the second-class and made the\nacquaintance of the volunteers.",
      "They were sitting in a corner of the\ncarriage, talking loudly and obviously aware that the attention of the\npassengers and Katavasov as he got in was concentrated upon them.",
      "More\nloudly than all talked the tall, hollow-chested young man.",
      "He was\nunmistakably tipsy, and was relating some story that had occurred at\nhis school.",
      "Facing him sat a middle-aged officer in the Austrian\nmilitary jacket of the Guards uniform.",
      "He was listening with a smile to\nthe hollow-chested youth, and occasionally pulling him up.",
      "The third,\nin an artillery uniform, was sitting on a box beside them.",
      "A fourth was\nasleep.",
      "Entering into conversation with the youth, Katavasov learned that he\nwas a wealthy Moscow merchant who had run through a large fortune\nbefore he was two-and-twenty.",
      "Katavasov did not like him, because he\nwas unmanly and effeminate and sickly.",
      "He was obviously convinced,\nespecially now after drinking, that he was performing a heroic action,\nand he bragged of it in the most unpleasant way.",
      "The second, the retired officer, made an unpleasant impression too upon\nKatavasov.",
      "He was, it seemed, a man who had tried everything.",
      "He had\nbeen on a railway, had been a land-steward, and had started factories,\nand he talked, quite without necessity, of all he had done, and used\nlearned expressions quite inappropriately.",
      "The third, the artilleryman, on the contrary, struck Katavasov very\nfavorably.",
      "He was a quiet, modest fellow, unmistakably impressed by the\nknowledge of the officer and the heroic self-sacrifice of the merchant\nand saying nothing about himself.",
      "When Katavasov asked him what had\nimpelled him to go to Servia, he answered modestly:\n\n Oh, well, everyone s going.",
      "The Servians want help, too.",
      "I m sorry for\nthem.",
      "Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,  said Katavasov.",
      "Oh, I wasn t long in the artillery, maybe they ll put me into the\ninfantry or the cavalry.",
      "Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?",
      "said\nKatavasov, fancying from the artilleryman s apparent age that he must\nhave reached a fairly high grade.",
      "I wasn t long in the artillery; I m a cadet retired,  he said, and he\nbegan to explain how he had failed in his examination.",
      "All of this together made a disagreeable impression on Katavasov, and\nwhen the volunteers got out at a station for a drink, Katavasov would\nhave liked to compare his unfavorable impression in conversation with\nsomeone.",
      "There was an old man in the carriage, wearing a military\novercoat, who had been listening all the while to Katavasov s\nconversation with the volunteers.",
      "When they were left alone, Katavasov\naddressed him.",
      "What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are\ngoing off there,  Katavasov said vaguely, not wishing to express his\nown opinion, and at the same time anxious to find out the old man s\nviews.",
      "The old man was an officer who had served on two campaigns.",
      "He knew\nwhat makes a soldier, and judging by the appearance and the talk of\nthose persons, by the swagger with which they had recourse to the\nbottle on the journey, he considered them poor soldiers.",
      "Moreover, he\nlived in a district town, and he was longing to tell how one soldier\nhad volunteered from his town, a drunkard and a thief whom no one would\nemploy as a laborer.",
      "But knowing by experience that in the present\ncondition of the public temper it was dangerous to express an opinion\nopposed to the general one, and especially to criticize the volunteers\nunfavorably, he too watched Katavasov without committing himself.",
      "Well, men are wanted there,  he said, laughing with his eyes.",
      "And they\nfell to talking of the last war news, and each concealed from the other\nhis perplexity as to the engagement expected next day, since the Turks\nhad been beaten, according to the latest news, at all points.",
      "And so\nthey parted, neither giving expression to his opinion.",
      "Katavasov went back to his own carriage, and with reluctant hypocrisy\nreported to Sergey Ivanovitch his observations of the volunteers, from\nwhich it would appear that they were capital fellows.",
      "At a big station at a town the volunteers were again greeted with\nshouts and singing, again men and women with collecting boxes appeared,\nand provincial ladies brought bouquets to the volunteers and followed\nthem into the refreshment room; but all this was on a much smaller and\nfeebler scale than in Moscow.",
      "Chapter 4\n\nWhile the train was stopping at the provincial town, Sergey Ivanovitch\ndid not go to the refreshment room, but walked up and down the\nplatform.",
      "The first time he passed Vronsky s compartment he noticed that the\ncurtain was drawn over the window; but as he passed it the second time\nhe saw the old countess at the window.",
      "She beckoned to Koznishev.",
      "I m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk,  she said.",
      "Yes, so I heard,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, standing at her window and\npeeping in.",
      "What a noble act on his part!",
      "he added, noticing that\nVronsky was not in the compartment.",
      "Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?",
      "What a terrible thing it was!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Ah, what I have been through!",
      "But do get in.... Ah, what I have been\nthrough!",
      "she repeated, when Sergey Ivanovitch had got in and sat down\nbeside her.",
      "You can t conceive it!",
      "For six weeks he did not speak to\nanyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him.",
      "And not\nfor one minute could we leave him alone.",
      "We took away everything he\ncould have used against himself.",
      "We lived on the ground floor, but\nthere was no reckoning on anything.",
      "You know, of course, that he had\nshot himself once already on her account,  she said, and the old lady s\neyelashes twitched at the recollection.",
      "Yes, hers was the fitting end\nfor such a woman.",
      "Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.",
      "It s not for us to judge, countess,  said Sergey Ivanovitch;  but I\ncan understand that it has been very hard for you.",
      "Ah, don t speak of it!",
      "I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.",
      "A note was brought him.",
      "He wrote an answer and sent it off.",
      "We hadn t\nan idea that she was close by at the station.",
      "In the evening I had only\njust gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself\nunder the train.",
      "Something seemed to strike me at once.",
      "I knew it was\nshe.",
      "The first thing I said was, he was not to be told.",
      "But they d told\nhim already.",
      "His coachman was there and saw it all.",
      "When I ran into his\nroom, he was beside himself it was fearful to see him.",
      "He didn t say a\nword, but galloped off there.",
      "I don t know to this day what happened\nthere, but he was brought back at death s door.",
      "I shouldn t have known\nhim.",
      "_Prostration compl te,_ the doctor said.",
      "And that was followed\nalmost by madness.",
      "Oh, why talk of it!",
      "said the countess with a wave\nof her hand.",
      "It was an awful time!",
      "No, say what you will, she was a\nbad woman.",
      "Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions?",
      "It was\nall to show herself something out of the way.",
      "Well, and that she did\ndo.",
      "She brought herself to ruin and two good men her husband and my\nunhappy son.",
      "And what did her husband do?",
      "asked Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "He has taken her daughter.",
      "Alexey was ready to agree to anything at\nfirst.",
      "Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own\nchild away to another man.",
      "But he can t take back his word.",
      "Karenin\ncame to the funeral.",
      "But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey.",
      "For\nhim, for her husband, it was easier, anyway.",
      "She had set him free.",
      "But\nmy poor son was utterly given up to her.",
      "He had thrown up everything,\nhis career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set\npurpose she made his ruin complete.",
      "No, say what you will, her very\ndeath was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling.",
      "God\nforgive me, but I can t help hating the memory of her, when I look at\nmy son s misery!",
      "But how is he now?",
      "It was a blessing from Providence for us this Servian war.",
      "I m old,\nand I don t understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it s come as a\nprovidential blessing to him.",
      "Of course for me, as his mother, it s\nterrible; and what s worse, they say, _ce n est pas tr s bien vu  \nP tersbourg_.",
      "But it can t be helped!",
      "It was the one thing that could\nrouse him.",
      "Yashvin a friend of his he had lost all he had at cards and\nhe was going to Servia.",
      "He came to see him and persuaded him to go.",
      "Now\nit s an interest for him.",
      "Do please talk to him a little.",
      "I want to\ndistract his mind.",
      "He s so low-spirited.",
      "And as bad luck would have it,\nhe has toothache too.",
      "But he ll be delighted to see you.",
      "Please do talk\nto him; he s walking up and down on that side.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch said he would be very glad to, and crossed over to\nthe other side of the station.",
      "Chapter 5\n\nIn the slanting evening shadows cast by the baggage piled up on the\nplatform, Vronsky in his long overcoat and slouch hat, with his hands\nin his pockets, strode up and down, like a wild beast in a cage,\nturning sharply after twenty paces.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch fancied, as he\napproached him, that Vronsky saw him but was pretending not to see.",
      "This did not affect Sergey Ivanovitch in the slightest.",
      "He was above\nall personal considerations with Vronsky.",
      "At that moment Sergey Ivanovitch looked upon Vronsky as a man taking an\nimportant part in a great cause, and Koznishev thought it his duty to\nencourage him and express his approval.",
      "He went up to him.",
      "Vronsky stood still, looked intently at him, recognized him, and going\na few steps forward to meet him, shook hands with him very warmly.",
      "Possibly you didn t wish to see me,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,  but\ncouldn t I be of use to you?",
      "There s no one I should less dislike seeing than you,  said Vronsky.",
      "Excuse me; and there s nothing in life for me to like.",
      "I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my services,  said\nSergey Ivanovitch, scanning Vronsky s face, full of unmistakable\nsuffering.",
      "Wouldn t it be of use to you to have a letter to\nRistitch to Milan?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "Vronsky said, seeming to understand him with difficulty.",
      "If\nyou don t mind, let s walk on.",
      "It s so stuffy among the carriages.",
      "A\nletter?",
      "No, thank you; to meet death one needs no letters of\nintroduction.",
      "Nor for the Turks....  he said, with a smile that was\nmerely of the lips.",
      "His eyes still kept their look of angry suffering.",
      "Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are\nafter all essential, with anyone prepared to see you.",
      "But that s as you\nlike.",
      "I was very glad to hear of your intention.",
      "There have been so\nmany attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like you raises them in\npublic estimation.",
      "My use as a man,  said Vronsky,  is that life s worth nothing to me.",
      "And that I ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks, and\nto trample on them or fall I know that.",
      "I m glad there s something to\ngive my life for, for it s not simply useless but loathsome to me.",
      "Anyone s welcome to it.",
      "And his jaw twitched impatiently from the\nincessant gnawing toothache, that prevented him from even speaking with\na natural expression.",
      "You will become another man, I predict,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,\nfeeling touched.",
      "To deliver one s brother-men from bondage is an aim\nworth death and life.",
      "God grant you success outwardly and inwardly\npeace,  he added, and he held out his hand.",
      "Vronsky warmly pressed his\noutstretched hand.",
      "Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use.",
      "But as a man, I m a wreck,  he\njerked out.",
      "He could hardly speak for the throbbing ache in his strong teeth, that\nwere like rows of ivory in his mouth.",
      "He was silent, and his eyes\nrested on the wheels of the tender, slowly and smoothly rolling along\nthe rails.",
      "And all at once a different pain, not an ache, but an inner trouble,\nthat set his whole being in anguish, made him for an instant forget his\ntoothache.",
      "As he glanced at the tender and the rails, under the\ninfluence of the conversation with a friend he had not met since his\nmisfortune, he suddenly recalled _her_ that is, what was left of her\nwhen he had run like one distraught into the cloak room of the railway\nstation on the table, shamelessly sprawling out among strangers, the\nbloodstained body so lately full of life; the head unhurt dropping back\nwith its weight of hair, and the curling tresses about the temples, and\nthe exquisite face, with red, half-opened mouth, the strange, fixed\nexpression, piteous on the lips and awful in the still open eyes, that\nseemed to utter that fearful phrase that he would be sorry for it that\nshe had said when they were quarreling.",
      "And he tried to think of her as she was when he met her the first time,\nat a railway station too, mysterious, exquisite, loving, seeking and\ngiving happiness, and not cruelly revengeful as he remembered her on\nthat last moment.",
      "He tried to recall his best moments with her, but\nthose moments were poisoned forever.",
      "He could only think of her as\ntriumphant, successful in her menace of a wholly useless remorse never\nto be effaced.",
      "He lost all consciousness of toothache, and his face\nworked with sobs.",
      "Passing twice up and down beside the baggage in silence and regaining\nhis self-possession, he addressed Sergey Ivanovitch calmly:\n\n You have had no telegrams since yesterday s?",
      "Yes, driven back for a\nthird time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.",
      "And after talking a little more of King Milan s proclamation, and the\nimmense effect it might have, they parted, going to their carriages on\nhearing the second bell.",
      "Chapter 6\n\nSergey Ivanovitch had not telegraphed to his brother to send to meet\nhim, as he did not know when he should be able to leave Moscow.",
      "Levin\nwas not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at\nthe station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as\nMoors from the dust of the road.",
      "Kitty, sitting on the balcony with her\nfather and sister, recognized her brother-in-law, and ran down to meet\nhim.",
      "What a shame not to have let us know,  she said, giving her hand to\nSergey Ivanovitch, and putting her forehead up for him to kiss.",
      "We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,  answered Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "I m so dirty.",
      "I m afraid to touch you.",
      "I ve been so busy,\nI didn t know when I should be able to tear myself away.",
      "And so you re\nstill as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness,  he said,\nsmiling,  out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater.",
      "Here s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting\nhere at last.",
      "But I m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash, \nsaid Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled,\nhis teeth flashing white in his black face.",
      "Kostya will be delighted.",
      "He has gone to his settlement.",
      "It s time he\nshould be home.",
      "Busy as ever with his farming.",
      "It really is a peaceful backwater, \nsaid Katavasov;  while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.",
      "Well, how does our friend look at it?",
      "He s sure not to think like other\npeople.",
      "Oh, I don t know, like everybody else,  Kitty answered, a little\nembarrassed, looking round at Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I ll send to fetch\nhim.",
      "Papa s staying with us.",
      "He s only just come home from abroad.",
      "And making arrangements to send for Levin and for the guests to wash,\none in his room and the other in what had been Dolly s, and giving\norders for their luncheon, Kitty ran out onto the balcony, enjoying the\nfreedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived\nduring the months of her pregnancy.",
      "It s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,  she said.",
      "Oh, that s a bore in this heat,  said the prince.",
      "No, papa, he s very nice, and Kostya s very fond of him,  Kitty said,\nwith a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her father s face.",
      "Oh, I didn t say anything.",
      "You go to them, darling,  said Kitty to her sister,  and entertain\nthem.",
      "They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well.",
      "And I must run\nto Mitya.",
      "As ill-luck would have it, I haven t fed him since tea.",
      "He s\nawake now, and sure to be screaming.",
      "And feeling a rush of milk, she\nhurried to the nursery.",
      "This was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so\nclose, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,\nand knew for certain he was hungry.",
      "She knew he was crying before she reached the nursery.",
      "And he was\nindeed crying.",
      "She heard him and hastened.",
      "But the faster she went, the\nlouder he screamed.",
      "It was a fine healthy scream, hungry and impatient.",
      "Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?",
      "said Kitty hurriedly,\nseating herself on a chair, and preparing to give the baby the breast.",
      "But give me him quickly.",
      "Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are!",
      "There, tie\nthe cap afterwards, do!",
      "The baby s greedy scream was passing into sobs.",
      "But you can t manage so, ma am,  said Agafea Mihalovna, who was almost\nalways to be found in the nursery.",
      "He must be put straight.",
      "A-oo!",
      "a-oo!",
      "she chanted over him, paying no attention to the mother.",
      "The nurse brought the baby to his mother.",
      "Agafea Mihalovna followed him\nwith a face dissolving with tenderness.",
      "He knows me, he knows me.",
      "In God s faith, Katerina Alexandrovna,\nma am, he knew me!",
      "Agafea Mihalovna cried above the baby s screams.",
      "But Kitty did not hear her words.",
      "Her impatience kept growing, like the\nbaby s.\n\nTheir impatience hindered things for a while.",
      "The baby could not get\nhold of the breast right, and was furious.",
      "At last, after despairing, breathless screaming, and vain sucking,\nthings went right, and mother and child felt simultaneously soothed,\nand both subsided into calm.",
      "But poor darling, he s all in perspiration!",
      "said Kitty in a whisper,\ntouching the baby.",
      "What makes you think he knows you?",
      "she added, with a sidelong glance\nat the baby s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under\nhis cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed\nhand he was waving.",
      "Impossible!",
      "If he knew anyone, he would have known me,  said Kitty, in\nresponse to Agafea Mihalovna s statement, and she smiled.",
      "She smiled because, though she said he could not know her, in her heart\nshe was sure that he knew not merely Agafea Mihalovna, but that he knew\nand understood everything, and knew and understood a great deal too\nthat no one else knew, and that she, his mother, had learned and come\nto understand only through him.",
      "To Agafea Mihalovna, to the nurse, to\nhis grandfather, to his father even, Mitya was a living being,\nrequiring only material care, but for his mother he had long been a\nmortal being, with whom there had been a whole series of spiritual\nrelations already.",
      "When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself.",
      "Then when I\ndo like this, he simply beams on me, the darling!",
      "Simply beams like a\nsunny day!",
      "said Agafea Mihalovna.",
      "Well, well; then we shall see,  whispered Kitty.",
      "But now go away,\nhe s going to sleep.",
      "Chapter 7\n\nAgafea Mihalovna went out on tiptoe; the nurse let down the blind,\nchased a fly out from under the muslin canopy of the crib, and a\nbumblebee struggling on the window-frame, and sat down waving a faded\nbranch of birch over the mother and the baby.",
      "How hot it is!",
      "if God would send a drop of rain,  she said.",
      "Yes, yes, sh sh sh  was all Kitty answered, rocking a little, and\ntenderly squeezing the plump little arm, with rolls of fat at the\nwrist, which Mitya still waved feebly as he opened and shut his eyes.",
      "That hand worried Kitty; she longed to kiss the little hand, but was\nafraid to for fear of waking the baby.",
      "At last the little hand ceased\nwaving, and the eyes closed.",
      "Only from time to time, as he went on\nsucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his\nmother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight.",
      "The nurse had\nleft off fanning, and was dozing.",
      "From above came the peals of the old\nprince s voice, and the chuckle of Katavasov.",
      "They have got into talk without me,  thought Kitty,  but still it s\nvexing that Kostya s out.",
      "He s sure to have gone to the bee-house\nagain.",
      "Though it s a pity he s there so often, still I m glad.",
      "It\ndistracts his mind.",
      "He s become altogether happier and better now than\nin the spring.",
      "He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt\nfrightened for him.",
      "And how absurd he is!",
      "she whispered, smiling.",
      "She knew what worried her husband.",
      "It was his unbelief.",
      "Although, if\nshe had been asked whether she supposed that in the future life, if he\ndid not believe, he would be damned, she would have had to admit that\nhe would be damned, his unbelief did not cause her unhappiness.",
      "And\nshe, confessing that for an unbeliever there can be no salvation, and\nloving her husband s soul more than anything in the world, thought with\na smile of his unbelief, and told herself that he was absurd.",
      "What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?",
      "she wondered.",
      "If it s all written in those books, he can understand\nthem.",
      "If it s all wrong, why does he read them?",
      "He says himself that he\nwould like to believe.",
      "Then why is it he doesn t believe?",
      "Surely from\nhis thinking so much?",
      "And he thinks so much from being solitary.",
      "He s\nalways alone, alone.",
      "He can t talk about it all to us.",
      "I fancy he ll be\nglad of these visitors, especially Katavasov.",
      "He likes discussions with\nthem,  she thought, and passed instantly to the consideration of where\nit would be more convenient to put Katavasov, to sleep alone or to\nshare Sergey Ivanovitch s room.",
      "And then an idea suddenly struck her,\nwhich made her shudder and even disturb Mitya, who glanced severely at\nher.",
      "I do believe the laundress hasn t sent the washing yet, and all\nthe best sheets are in use.",
      "If I don t see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will\ngive Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,  and at the very idea of this\nthe blood rushed to Kitty s face.",
      "Yes, I will arrange it,  she decided, and going back to her former\nthoughts, she remembered that some spiritual question of importance had\nbeen interrupted, and she began to recall what.",
      "Yes, Kostya, an\nunbeliever,  she thought again with a smile.",
      "Well, an unbeliever then!",
      "Better let him always be one than like\nMadame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad.",
      "No, he won t\never sham anything.",
      "And a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind.",
      "A\nfortnight ago a penitent letter had come from Stepan Arkadyevitch to\nDolly.",
      "He besought her to save his honor, to sell her estate to pay his\ndebts.",
      "Dolly was in despair, she detested her husband, despised him,\npitied him, resolved on a separation, resolved to refuse, but ended by\nagreeing to sell part of her property.",
      "After that, with an\nirrepressible smile of tenderness, Kitty recalled her husband s\nshamefaced embarrassment, his repeated awkward efforts to approach the\nsubject, and how at last, having thought of the one means of helping\nDolly without wounding her pride, he had suggested to Kitty what had\nnot occurred to her before that she should give up her share of the\nproperty.",
      "He an unbeliever indeed!",
      "With his heart, his dread of offending\nanyone, even a child!",
      "Everything for others, nothing for himself.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya s duty to be his\nsteward.",
      "And it s the same with his sister.",
      "Now Dolly and her children\nare under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every\nday, as though he were bound to be at their service.",
      "Yes, only be like your father, only like him,  she said, handing Mitya\nover to the nurse, and putting her lips to his cheek.",
      "Chapter 8\n\nEver since, by his beloved brother s deathbed, Levin had first glanced\ninto the questions of life and death in the light of these new\nconvictions, as he called them, which had during the period from his\ntwentieth to his thirty-fourth year imperceptibly replaced his childish\nand youthful beliefs he had been stricken with horror, not so much of\ndeath, as of life, without any knowledge of whence, and why, and how,\nand what it was.",
      "The physical organization, its decay, the\nindestructibility of matter, the law of the conservation of energy,\nevolution, were the words which usurped the place of his old belief.",
      "These words and the ideas associated with them were very well for\nintellectual purposes.",
      "But for life they yielded nothing, and Levin\nfelt suddenly like a man who has changed his warm fur cloak for a\nmuslin garment, and going for the first time into the frost is\nimmediately convinced, not by reason, but by his whole nature that he\nis as good as naked, and that he must infallibly perish miserably.",
      "From that moment, though he did not distinctly face it, and still went\non living as before, Levin had never lost this sense of terror at his\nlack of knowledge.",
      "He vaguely felt, too, that what he called his new convictions were not\nmerely lack of knowledge, but that they were part of a whole order of\nideas, in which no knowledge of what he needed was possible.",
      "At first, marriage, with the new joys and duties bound up with it, had\ncompletely crowded out these thoughts.",
      "But of late, while he was\nstaying in Moscow after his wife s confinement, with nothing to do, the\nquestion that clamored for solution had more and more often, more and\nmore insistently, haunted Levin s mind.",
      "The question was summed up for him thus:  If I do not accept the\nanswers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do\nI accept?",
      "And in the whole arsenal of his convictions, so far from\nfinding any satisfactory answers, he was utterly unable to find\nanything at all like an answer.",
      "He was in the position of a man seeking food in toy shops and tool\nshops.",
      "Instinctively, unconsciously, with every book, with every conversation,\nwith every man he met, he was on the lookout for light on these\nquestions and their solution.",
      "What puzzled and distracted him above everything was that the majority\nof men of his age and circle had, like him, exchanged their old beliefs\nfor the same new convictions, and yet saw nothing to lament in this,\nand were perfectly satisfied and serene.",
      "So that, apart from the\nprincipal question, Levin was tortured by other questions too.",
      "Were\nthese people sincere?",
      "he asked himself, or were they playing a part?",
      "or\nwas it that they understood the answers science gave to these problems\nin some different, clearer sense than he did?",
      "And he assiduously\nstudied both these men s opinions and the books which treated of these\nscientific explanations.",
      "One fact he had found out since these questions had engrossed his mind,\nwas that he had been quite wrong in supposing from the recollections of\nthe circle of his young days at college, that religion had outlived its\nday, and that it was now practically non-existent.",
      "All the people\nnearest to him who were good in their lives were believers.",
      "The old\nprince, and Lvov, whom he liked so much, and Sergey Ivanovitch, and all\nthe women believed, and his wife believed as simply as he had believed\nin his earliest childhood, and ninety-nine hundredths of the Russian\npeople, all the working people for whose life he felt the deepest\nrespect, believed.",
      "Another fact of which he became convinced, after reading many\nscientific books, was that the men who shared his views had no other\nconstruction to put on them, and that they gave no explanation of the\nquestions which he felt he could not live without answering, but simply\nignored their existence and attempted to explain other questions of no\npossible interest to him, such as the evolution of organisms, the\nmaterialistic theory of consciousness, and so forth.",
      "Moreover, during his wife s confinement, something had happened that\nseemed extraordinary to him.",
      "He, an unbeliever, had fallen into\npraying, and at the moment he prayed, he believed.",
      "But that moment had\npassed, and he could not make his state of mind at that moment fit into\nthe rest of his life.",
      "He could not admit that at that moment he knew the truth, and that now\nhe was wrong; for as soon as he began thinking calmly about it, it all\nfell to pieces.",
      "He could not admit that he was mistaken then, for his\nspiritual condition then was precious to him, and to admit that it was\na proof of weakness would have been to desecrate those moments.",
      "He was\nmiserably divided against himself, and strained all his spiritual\nforces to the utmost to escape from this condition.",
      "Chapter 9\n\nThese doubts fretted and harassed him, growing weaker or stronger from\ntime to time, but never leaving him.",
      "He read and thought, and the more\nhe read and the more he thought, the further he felt from the aim he\nwas pursuing.",
      "Of late in Moscow and in the country, since he had become convinced\nthat he would find no solution in the materialists, he had read and\nre-read thoroughly Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Schelling, Hegel, and\nSchopenhauer, the philosophers who gave a non-materialistic explanation\nof life.",
      "Their ideas seemed to him fruitful when he was reading or was himself\nseeking arguments to refute other theories, especially those of the\nmaterialists; but as soon as he began to read or sought for himself a\nsolution of problems, the same thing always happened.",
      "As long as he\nfollowed the fixed definition of obscure words such as _spirit, will,\nfreedom, essence,_ purposely letting himself go into the snare of words\nthe philosophers set for him, he seemed to comprehend something.",
      "But he\nhad only to forget the artificial train of reasoning, and to turn from\nlife itself to what had satisfied him while thinking in accordance with\nthe fixed definitions, and all this artificial edifice fell to pieces\nat once like a house of cards, and it became clear that the edifice had\nbeen built up out of those transposed words, apart from anything in\nlife more important than reason.",
      "At one time, reading Schopenhauer, he put in place of his _will_ the\nword _love_, and for a couple of days this new philosophy charmed him,\ntill he removed a little away from it.",
      "But then, when he turned from\nlife itself to glance at it again, it fell away too, and proved to be\nthe same muslin garment with no warmth in it.",
      "His brother Sergey Ivanovitch advised him to read the theological works\nof Homiakov.",
      "Levin read the second volume of Homiakov s works, and in\nspite of the elegant, epigrammatic, argumentative style which at first\nrepelled him, he was impressed by the doctrine of the church he found\nin them.",
      "He was struck at first by the idea that the apprehension of\ndivine truths had not been vouchsafed to man, but to a corporation of\nmen bound together by love to the church.",
      "What delighted him was the\nthought how much easier it was to believe in a still existing living\nchurch, embracing all the beliefs of men, and having God at its head,\nand therefore holy and infallible, and from it to accept the faith in\nGod, in the creation, the fall, the redemption, than to begin with God,\na mysterious, far-away God, the creation, etc.",
      "But afterwards, on\nreading a Catholic writer s history of the church, and then a Greek\northodox writer s history of the church, and seeing that the two\nchurches, in their very conception infallible, each deny the authority\nof the other, Homiakov s doctrine of the church lost all its charm for\nhim, and this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers \nedifices.",
      "All that spring he was not himself, and went through fearful moments of\nhorror.",
      "Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life s impossible; and\nthat I can t know, and so I can t live,  Levin said to himself.",
      "In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a\nbubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that\nbubble is Me.",
      "It was an agonizing error, but it was the sole logical result of ages\nof human thought in that direction.",
      "This was the ultimate belief on which all the systems elaborated by\nhuman thought in almost all their ramifications rested.",
      "It was the\nprevalent conviction, and of all other explanations Levin had\nunconsciously, not knowing when or how, chosen it, as anyway the\nclearest, and made it his own.",
      "But it was not merely a falsehood, it was the cruel jeer of some wicked\npower, some evil, hateful power, to whom one could not submit.",
      "He must escape from this power.",
      "And the means of escape every man had\nin his own hands.",
      "He had but to cut short this dependence on evil.",
      "And\nthere was one means death.",
      "And Levin, a happy father and husband, in perfect health, was several\ntimes so near suicide that he hid the cord that he might not be tempted\nto hang himself, and was afraid to go out with his gun for fear of\nshooting himself.",
      "But Levin did not shoot himself, and did not hang himself; he went on\nliving.",
      "Chapter 10\n\nWhen Levin thought what he was and what he was living for, he could\nfind no answer to the questions and was reduced to despair, but he left\noff questioning himself about it.",
      "It seemed as though he knew both what\nhe was and for what he was living, for he acted and lived resolutely\nand without hesitation.",
      "Indeed, in these latter days he was far more\ndecided and unhesitating in life than he had ever been.",
      "When he went back to the country at the beginning of June, he went back\nalso to his usual pursuits.",
      "The management of the estate, his relations\nwith the peasants and the neighbors, the care of his household, the\nmanagement of his sister s and brother s property, of which he had the\ndirection, his relations with his wife and kindred, the care of his\nchild, and the new bee-keeping hobby he had taken up that spring,\nfilled all his time.",
      "These things occupied him now, not because he justified them to himself\nby any sort of general principles, as he had done in former days; on\nthe contrary, disappointed by the failure of his former efforts for the\ngeneral welfare, and too much occupied with his own thought and the\nmass of business with which he was burdened from all sides, he had\ncompletely given up thinking of the general good, and he busied himself\nwith all this work simply because it seemed to him that he must do what\nhe was doing that he could not do otherwise.",
      "In former days almost from\nchildhood, and increasingly up to full manhood when he had tried to do\nanything that would be good for all, for humanity, for Russia, for the\nwhole village, he had noticed that the idea of it had been pleasant,\nbut the work itself had always been incoherent, that then he had never\nhad a full conviction of its absolute necessity, and that the work that\nhad begun by seeming so great, had grown less and less, till it\nvanished into nothing.",
      "But now, since his marriage, when he had begun\nto confine himself more and more to living for himself, though he\nexperienced no delight at all at the thought of the work he was doing,\nhe felt a complete conviction of its necessity, saw that it succeeded\nfar better than in old days, and that it kept on growing more and more.",
      "Now, involuntarily it seemed, he cut more and more deeply into the soil\nlike a plough, so that he could not be drawn out without turning aside\nthe furrow.",
      "To live the same family life as his father and forefathers that is, in\nthe same condition of culture and to bring up his children in the same,\nwas incontestably necessary.",
      "It was as necessary as dining when one was\nhungry.",
      "And to do this, just as it was necessary to cook dinner, it was\nnecessary to keep the mechanism of agriculture at Pokrovskoe going so\nas to yield an income.",
      "Just as incontestably as it was necessary to\nrepay a debt was it necessary to keep the property in such a condition\nthat his son, when he received it as a heritage, would say  thank you \nto his father as Levin had said  thank you  to his grandfather for all\nhe built and planted.",
      "And to do this it was necessary to look after the\nland himself, not to let it, and to breed cattle, manure the fields,\nand plant timber.",
      "It was impossible not to look after the affairs of Sergey Ivanovitch,\nof his sister, of the peasants who came to him for advice and were\naccustomed to do so as impossible as to fling down a child one is\ncarrying in one s arms.",
      "It was necessary to look after the comfort of\nhis sister-in-law and her children, and of his wife and baby, and it\nwas impossible not to spend with them at least a short time each day.",
      "And all this, together with shooting and his new bee-keeping, filled up\nthe whole of Levin s life, which had no meaning at all for him, when he\nbegan to think.",
      "But besides knowing thoroughly what he had to do, Levin knew in just\nthe same way _how_ he had to do it all, and what was more important\nthan the rest.",
      "He knew he must hire laborers as cheaply as possible; but to hire men\nunder bond, paying them in advance at less than the current rate of\nwages, was what he must not do, even though it was very profitable.",
      "Selling straw to the peasants in times of scarcity of provender was\nwhat he might do, even though he felt sorry for them; but the tavern\nand the pothouse must be put down, though they were a source of income.",
      "Felling timber must be punished as severely as possible, but he could\nnot exact forfeits for cattle being driven onto his fields; and though\nit annoyed the keeper and made the peasants not afraid to graze their\ncattle on his land, he could not keep their cattle as a punishment.",
      "To Pyotr, who was paying a money-lender ten per cent.",
      "a month, he must\nlend a sum of money to set him free.",
      "But he could not let off peasants\nwho did not pay their rent, nor let them fall into arrears.",
      "It was\nimpossible to overlook the bailiff s not having mown the meadows and\nletting the hay spoil; and it was equally impossible to mow those acres\nwhere a young copse had been planted.",
      "It was impossible to excuse a\nlaborer who had gone home in the busy season because his father was\ndying, however sorry he might feel for him, and he must subtract from\nhis pay those costly months of idleness.",
      "But it was impossible not to\nallow monthly rations to the old servants who were of no use for\nanything.",
      "Levin knew that when he got home he must first of all go to his wife,\nwho was unwell, and that the peasants who had been waiting for three\nhours to see him could wait a little longer.",
      "He knew too that,\nregardless of all the pleasure he felt in taking a swarm, he must\nforego that pleasure, and leave the old man to see to the bees alone,\nwhile he talked to the peasants who had come after him to the\nbee-house.",
      "Whether he were acting rightly or wrongly he did not know, and far from\ntrying to prove that he was, nowadays he avoided all thought or talk\nabout it.",
      "Reasoning had brought him to doubt, and prevented him from seeing what\nhe ought to do and what he ought not.",
      "When he did not think, but simply\nlived, he was continually aware of the presence of an infallible judge\nin his soul, determining which of two possible courses of action was\nthe better and which was the worse, and as soon as he did not act\nrightly, he was at once aware of it.",
      "So he lived, not knowing and not seeing any chance of knowing what he\nwas and what he was living for, and harassed at this lack of knowledge\nto such a point that he was afraid of suicide, and yet firmly laying\ndown his own individual definite path in life.",
      "Chapter 11\n\nThe day on which Sergey Ivanovitch came to Pokrovskoe was one of\nLevin s most painful days.",
      "It was the very busiest working time, when\nall the peasantry show an extraordinary intensity of self-sacrifice in\nlabor, such as is never shown in any other conditions of life, and\nwould be highly esteemed if the men who showed these qualities\nthemselves thought highly of them, and if it were not repeated every\nyear, and if the results of this intense labor were not so simple.",
      "To reap and bind the rye and oats and to carry it, to mow the meadows,\nturn over the fallows, thrash the seed and sow the winter corn all this\nseems so simple and ordinary; but to succeed in getting through it all\neveryone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil\nincessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual,\nliving on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the\nsheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the\ntwenty-four to sleep.",
      "And every year this is done all over Russia.",
      "Having lived the greater part of his life in the country and in the\nclosest relations with the peasants, Levin always felt in this busy\ntime that he was infected by this general quickening of energy in the\npeople.",
      "In the early morning he rode over to the first sowing of the rye, and\nto the oats, which were being carried to the stacks, and returning home\nat the time his wife and sister-in-law were getting up, he drank coffee\nwith them and walked to the farm, where a new thrashing machine was to\nbe set working to get ready the seed-corn.",
      "He was standing in the cool granary, still fragrant with the leaves of\nthe hazel branches interlaced on the freshly peeled aspen beams of the\nnew thatch roof.",
      "He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter\ndust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing\nfloor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from\nthe barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew\nchirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the\ncrevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark,\ndusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts.",
      "Why is it all being done?",
      "he thought.",
      "Why am I standing here, making\nthem work?",
      "What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal\nbefore me?",
      "What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for?",
      "(I\ndoctored her, when the beam fell on her in the fire)  he thought,\nlooking at a thin old woman who was raking up the grain, moving\npainfully with her bare, sun-blackened feet over the uneven, rough\nfloor.",
      "Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she\nwon t; they ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of\nthat smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action\nshakes the ears out of their husks.",
      "They ll bury her and this piebald\nhorse, and very soon too,  he thought, gazing at the heavily moving,\npanting horse that kept walking up the wheel that turned under him.",
      "And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard\nfull of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders they will bury\nhim.",
      "He s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the\nwomen, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel.",
      "And\nwhat s more, it s not them alone me they ll bury too, and nothing will\nbe left.",
      "What for?",
      "He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to reckon how\nmuch they thrashed in an hour.",
      "He wanted to know this so as to judge by\nit the task to set for the day.",
      "It ll soon be one, and they re only beginning the third sheaf, \nthought Levin.",
      "He went up to the man that was feeding the machine, and\nshouting over the roar of the machine he told him to put it in more\nslowly.",
      "You put in too much at a time, Fyodor.",
      "Do you see it gets\nchoked, that s why it isn t getting on.",
      "Do it evenly.",
      "Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted\nsomething in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want\nhim to.",
      "Levin, going up to the machine, moved Fyodor aside, and began feeding\nthe corn in himself.",
      "Working on till the peasants  dinner hour, which\nwas not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell\ninto talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on\nthe thrashing floor for seed.",
      "Fyodor came from a village at some distance from the one in which Levin\nhad once allotted land to his cooperative association.",
      "Now it had been\nlet to a former house porter.",
      "Levin talked to Fyodor about this land and asked whether Platon, a\nwell-to-do peasant of good character belonging to the same village,\nwould not take the land for the coming year.",
      "It s a high rent; it wouldn t pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch, \nanswered the peasant, picking the ears off his sweat-drenched shirt.",
      "But how does Kirillov make it pay?",
      "Mituh!",
      "(so the peasant called the house porter, in a tone of\ncontempt),  you may be sure he ll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!",
      "He ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it!",
      "He s no mercy\non a Christian.",
      "But Uncle Fokanitch  (so he called the old peasant\nPlaton),  do you suppose he d flay the skin off a man?",
      "Where there s\ndebt, he ll let anyone off.",
      "And he ll not wring the last penny out.",
      "He s a man too.",
      "But why will he let anyone off?",
      "Oh, well, of course, folks are different.",
      "One man lives for his own\nwants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his\nbelly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man.",
      "He lives for his soul.",
      "He does\nnot forget God.",
      "How thinks of God?",
      "How does he live for his soul?",
      "Levin almost\nshouted.",
      "Why, to be sure, in truth, in God s way.",
      "Folks are different.",
      "Take you\nnow, you wouldn t wrong a man....",
      "Yes, yes, good-bye!",
      "said Levin, breathless with excitement, and\nturning round he took his stick and walked quickly away towards home.",
      "At the peasant s words that Fokanitch lived for his soul, in truth, in\nGod s way, undefined but significant ideas seemed to burst out as\nthough they had been locked up, and all striving towards one goal, they\nthronged whirling through his head, blinding him with their light.",
      "Chapter 12\n\nLevin strode along the highroad, absorbed not so much in his thoughts\n(he could not yet disentangle them) as in his spiritual condition,\nunlike anything he had experienced before.",
      "The words uttered by the peasant had acted on his soul like an electric\nshock, suddenly transforming and combining into a single whole the\nwhole swarm of disjointed, impotent, separate thoughts that incessantly\noccupied his mind.",
      "These thoughts had unconsciously been in his mind\neven when he was talking about the land.",
      "He was aware of something new in his soul, and joyfully tested this new\nthing, not yet knowing what it was.",
      "Not living for his own wants, but for God?",
      "For what God?",
      "And could one\nsay anything more senseless than what he said?",
      "He said that one must\nnot live for one s own wants, that is, that one must not live for what\nwe understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live\nfor something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor\neven define.",
      "What of it?",
      "Didn t I understand those senseless words of\nFyodor s?",
      "And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth?",
      "Did I\nthink them stupid, obscure, inexact?",
      "No, I understood him, and exactly\nas he understands the words.",
      "I understood them more fully and clearly\nthan I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted\nnor can I doubt about it.",
      "And not only I, but everyone, the whole world\nunderstands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no\ndoubt and are always agreed.",
      "And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle\nwhich would convince me.",
      "A material miracle would have persuaded me.",
      "And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing,\nsurrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!",
      "Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly.",
      "That s comprehensible\nand rational.",
      "All of us as rational beings can t do anything else but\nlive for our belly.",
      "And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one\nmustn t live for one s belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at\na hint I understand him!",
      "And I and millions of men, men who lived ages\nago and men living now peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned,\nwho have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying\nthe same thing we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must\nlive for and what is good.",
      "I and all men have only one firm,\nincontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained\nby the reason it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no\neffects.",
      "If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a\nreward, it is not goodness either.",
      "So goodness is outside the chain of\ncause and effect.",
      "And yet I know it, and we all know it.",
      "What could be a greater miracle than that?",
      "Can I have found the solution of it all?",
      "can my sufferings be over?",
      "thought Levin, striding along the dusty road, not noticing the heat nor\nhis weariness, and experiencing a sense of relief from prolonged\nsuffering.",
      "This feeling was so delicious that it seemed to him\nincredible.",
      "He was breathless with emotion and incapable of going\nfarther; he turned off the road into the forest and lay down in the\nshade of an aspen on the uncut grass.",
      "He took his hat off his hot head\nand lay propped on his elbow in the lush, feathery, woodland grass.",
      "Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,  he thought,\nlooking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following the\nmovements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and\nlifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed.",
      "What have I\ndiscovered?",
      "he asked himself, bending aside the leaf of goat-weed out\nof the beetle s way and twisting another blade of grass above for the\nbeetle to cross over onto it.",
      "What is it makes me glad?",
      "What have I\ndiscovered?",
      "I have discovered nothing.",
      "I have only found out what I knew.",
      "I\nunderstand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives\nme life.",
      "I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.",
      "Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass\nand of this beetle (there, she didn t care for the grass, she s opened\nher wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation of\nmatter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.",
      "And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty\npatches, there was a process of evolution.",
      "Evolution from what?",
      "into\nwhat?",
      "Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any\nsort of tendency and struggle in the eternal!",
      "And I was astonished that\nin spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not\ndiscover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.",
      "Now I say that I know the meaning of my life:  To live for God, for my\nsoul.",
      "And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and\nmarvelous.",
      "Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing.",
      "Yes,\npride,  he said to himself, turning over on his stomach and beginning\nto tie a noose of blades of grass, trying not to break them.",
      "And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect.",
      "And most\nof all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect.",
      "The\ncheating knavishness of intellect, that s it,  he said to himself.",
      "And he briefly went through, mentally, the whole course of his ideas\nduring the last two years, the beginning of which was the clear\nconfronting of death at the sight of his dear brother hopelessly ill.\n\nThen, for the first time, grasping that for every man, and himself too,\nthere was nothing in store but suffering, death, and forgetfulness, he\nhad made up his mind that life was impossible like that, and that he\nmust either interpret life so that it would not present itself to him\nas the evil jest of some devil, or shoot himself.",
      "But he had not done either, but had gone on living, thinking, and\nfeeling, and had even at that very time married, and had had many joys\nand had been happy, when he was not thinking of the meaning of his\nlife.",
      "What did this mean?",
      "It meant that he had been living rightly, but\nthinking wrongly.",
      "He had lived (without being aware of it) on those spiritual truths that\nhe had sucked in with his mother s milk, but he had thought, not merely\nwithout recognition of these truths, but studiously ignoring them.",
      "Now it was clear to him that he could only live by virtue of the\nbeliefs in which he had been brought up.",
      "What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had\nnot had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and\nnot for my own desires?",
      "I should have robbed and lied and killed.",
      "Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed\nfor me.",
      "And with the utmost stretch of imagination he could not\nconceive the brutal creature he would have been himself, if he had not\nknown what he was living for.",
      "I looked for an answer to my question.",
      "And thought could not give an\nanswer to my question it is incommensurable with my question.",
      "The\nanswer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is\nright and what is wrong.",
      "And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any\nway, it was given to me as to all men, _given_, because I could not\nhave got it from anywhere.",
      "Where could I have got it?",
      "By reason could I have arrived at knowing\nthat I must love my neighbor and not oppress him?",
      "I was told that in my\nchildhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already\nin my soul.",
      "But who discovered it?",
      "Not reason.",
      "Reason discovered the\nstruggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who\nhinder the satisfaction of our desires.",
      "That is the deduction of\nreason.",
      "But loving one s neighbor reason could never discover, because\nit s irrational.",
      "Chapter 13\n\nAnd Levin remembered a scene he had lately witnessed between Dolly and\nher children.",
      "The children, left to themselves, had begun cooking\nraspberries over the candles and squirting milk into each other s\nmouths with a syringe.",
      "Their mother, catching them at these pranks,\nbegan reminding them in Levin s presence of the trouble their mischief\ngave to the grown-up people, and that this trouble was all for their\nsake, and that if they smashed the cups they would have nothing to\ndrink their tea out of, and that if they wasted the milk, they would\nhave nothing to eat, and die of hunger.",
      "And Levin had been struck by the passive, weary incredulity with which\nthe children heard what their mother said to them.",
      "They were simply\nannoyed that their amusing play had been interrupted, and did not\nbelieve a word of what their mother was saying.",
      "They could not believe\nit indeed, for they could not take in the immensity of all they\nhabitually enjoyed, and so could not conceive that what they were\ndestroying was the very thing they lived by.",
      "That all comes of itself,  they thought,  and there s nothing\ninteresting or important about it because it has always been so, and\nalways will be so.",
      "And it s all always the same.",
      "We ve no need to think\nabout that, it s all ready.",
      "But we want to invent something of our own,\nand new.",
      "So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking\nthem over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other s\nmouths.",
      "That s fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than\ndrinking out of cups.",
      "Isn t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of\nreason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of\nthe life of man?",
      "he thought.",
      "And don t all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the\npath of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him\nto a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so certainly\nthat he could not live at all without it?",
      "Isn t it distinctly to be\nseen in the development of each philosopher s theory, that he knows\nwhat is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively\nas the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is\nsimply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what\neveryone knows?",
      "Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and\nmake their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on.",
      "Would they\nbe naughty then?",
      "Why, they d die of hunger!",
      "Well, then, leave us with\nour passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the\nCreator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of\nmoral evil.",
      "Just try and build up anything without those ideas!",
      "We only try to destroy them, because we re spiritually provided for.",
      "Exactly like the children!",
      "Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that\nalone gives peace to my soul?",
      "Whence did I get it?",
      "Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with\nthe spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and\nliving on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them,\nand destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by.",
      "And as soon as an\nimportant moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold\nand hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when their\nmother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my\nchildish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.",
      "Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me,\nrevealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief\nthing taught by the church.",
      "The church!",
      "the church!",
      "Levin repeated to himself.",
      "He turned over on\nthe other side, and leaning on his elbow, fell to gazing into the\ndistance at a herd of cattle crossing over to the river.",
      "But can I believe in all the church teaches?",
      "he thought, trying\nhimself, and thinking of everything that could destroy his present\npeace of mind.",
      "Intentionally he recalled all those doctrines of the\nchurch which had always seemed most strange and had always been a\nstumbling block to him.",
      "The Creation?",
      "But how did I explain existence?",
      "By existence?",
      "By\nnothing?",
      "The devil and sin.",
      "But how do I explain evil?...",
      "The\natonement?...",
      "But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been\ntold to me and all men.",
      "And it seemed to him that there was not a single article of faith of\nthe church which could destroy the chief thing faith in God, in\ngoodness, as the one goal of man s destiny.",
      "Under every article of faith of the church could be put the faith in\nthe service of truth instead of one s desires.",
      "And each doctrine did\nnot simply leave that faith unshaken, each doctrine seemed essential to\ncomplete that great miracle, continually manifest upon earth, that made\nit possible for each man and millions of different sorts of men, wise\nmen and imbeciles, old men and children all men, peasants, Lvov, Kitty,\nbeggars and kings to understand perfectly the same one thing, and to\nbuild up thereby that life of the soul which alone is worth living, and\nwhich alone is precious to us.",
      "Lying on his back, he gazed up now into the high, cloudless sky.",
      "Do I\nnot know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?",
      "But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it\nnot round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite\nspace, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more\nright than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.",
      "Levin ceased thinking, and only, as it were, listened to mysterious\nvoices that seemed talking joyfully and earnestly within him.",
      "Can this be faith?",
      "he thought, afraid to believe in his happiness.",
      "My God, I thank Thee!",
      "he said, gulping down his sobs, and with both\nhands brushing away the tears that filled his eyes.",
      "Chapter 14\n\nLevin looked before him and saw a herd of cattle, then he caught sight\nof his trap with Raven in the shafts, and the coachman, who, driving up\nto the herd, said something to the herdsman.",
      "Then he heard the rattle\nof the wheels and the snort of the sleek horse close by him.",
      "But he was\nso buried in his thoughts that he did not even wonder why the coachman\nhad come for him.",
      "He only thought of that when the coachman had driven quite up to him\nand shouted to him.",
      "The mistress sent me.",
      "Your brother has come, and\nsome gentleman with him.",
      "Levin got into the trap and took the reins.",
      "As though just roused out\nof sleep, for a long while Levin could not collect his faculties.",
      "He\nstared at the sleek horse flecked with lather between his haunches and\non his neck, where the harness rubbed, stared at Ivan the coachman\nsitting beside him, and remembered that he was expecting his brother,\nthought that his wife was most likely uneasy at his long absence, and\ntried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother.",
      "And\nhis brother and his wife and the unknown guest seemed to him now quite\ndifferent from before.",
      "He fancied that now his relations with all men\nwould be different.",
      "With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used\nto be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall\nnever be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be\nfriendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be\ndifferent.",
      "Pulling the stiff rein and holding in the good horse that snorted with\nimpatience and seemed begging to be let go, Levin looked round at Ivan\nsitting beside him, not knowing what to do with his unoccupied hand,\ncontinually pressing down his shirt as it puffed out, and he tried to\nfind something to start a conversation about with him.",
      "He would have\nsaid that Ivan had pulled the saddle-girth up too high, but that was\nlike blame, and he longed for friendly, warm talk.",
      "Nothing else\noccurred to him.",
      "Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,  said the\ncoachman, pulling the rein Levin held.",
      "Please don t touch and don t teach me!",
      "said Levin, angered by this\ninterference.",
      "Now, as always, interference made him angry, and he felt\nsorrowfully at once how mistaken had been his supposition that his\nspiritual condition could immediately change him in contact with\nreality.",
      "He was not a quarter of a mile from home when he saw Grisha and Tanya\nrunning to meet him.",
      "Uncle Kostya!",
      "mamma s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch,\nand someone else,  they said, clambering up into the trap.",
      "Who is he?",
      "An awfully terrible person!",
      "And he does like this with his arms,  said\nTanya, getting up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov.",
      "Old or young?",
      "asked Levin, laughing, reminded of someone, he did not\nknow whom, by Tanya s performance.",
      "Oh, I hope it s not a tiresome person!",
      "thought Levin.",
      "As soon as he turned, at a bend in the road, and saw the party coming,\nLevin recognized Katavasov in a straw hat, walking along swinging his\narms just as Tanya had shown him.",
      "Katavasov was very fond of discussing\nmetaphysics, having derived his notions from natural science writers\nwho had never studied metaphysics, and in Moscow Levin had had many\narguments with him of late.",
      "And one of these arguments, in which Katavasov had obviously considered\nthat he came off victorious, was the first thing Levin thought of as he\nrecognized him.",
      "No, whatever I do, I won t argue and give utterance to my ideas\nlightly,  he thought.",
      "Getting out of the trap and greeting his brother and Katavasov, Levin\nasked about his wife.",
      "She has taken Mitya to Kolok  (a copse near the house).",
      "She meant to\nhave him out there because it s so hot indoors,  said Dolly.",
      "Levin had\nalways advised his wife not to take the baby to the wood, thinking it\nunsafe, and he was not pleased to hear this.",
      "She rushes about from place to place with him,  said the prince,\nsmiling.",
      "I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.",
      "She meant to come to the bee-house.",
      "She thought you would be there.",
      "We\nare going there,  said Dolly.",
      "Well, and what are you doing?",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, falling back\nfrom the rest and walking beside him.",
      "Oh, nothing special.",
      "Busy as usual with the land,  answered Levin.",
      "Well, and what about you?",
      "Come for long?",
      "We have been expecting you\nfor such a long time.",
      "Only for a fortnight.",
      "I ve a great deal to do in Moscow.",
      "At these words the brothers  eyes met, and Levin, in spite of the\ndesire he always had, stronger than ever just now, to be on\naffectionate and still more open terms with his brother, felt an\nawkwardness in looking at him.",
      "He dropped his eyes and did not know\nwhat to say.",
      "Casting over the subjects of conversation that would be pleasant to\nSergey Ivanovitch, and would keep him off the subject of the Servian\nwar and the Slavonic question, at which he had hinted by the allusion\nto what he had to do in Moscow, Levin began to talk of Sergey\nIvanovitch s book.",
      "Well, have there been reviews of your book?",
      "he asked.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch smiled at the intentional character of the question.",
      "No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,  he said.",
      "Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,  he added,\npointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the\naspen tree-tops.",
      "And these words were enough to re-establish again between the brothers\nthat tone hardly hostile, but chilly which Levin had been so longing to\navoid.",
      "Levin went up to Katavasov.",
      "It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,  he said to him.",
      "I ve been meaning to a long while.",
      "Now we shall have some discussion,\nwe ll see to that.",
      "Have you been reading Spencer?",
      "No, I ve not finished reading him,  said Levin.",
      "But I don t need him\nnow.",
      "How s that?",
      "that s interesting.",
      "Why so?",
      "I mean that I m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that\ninterest me I shall never find in him and his like.",
      "Now....",
      "But Katavasov s serene and good-humored expression suddenly struck him,\nand he felt such tenderness for his own happy mood, which he was\nunmistakably disturbing by this conversation, that he remembered his\nresolution and stopped short.",
      "But we ll talk later on,  he added.",
      "If we re going to the bee-house,\nit s this way, along this little path,  he said, addressing them all.",
      "Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one\nside with thick clumps of brilliant heart s-ease among which stood up\nhere and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his\nguests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some\nstumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be\nafraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread,\ncucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with.",
      "Trying to make his movements as deliberate as possible, and listening\nto the bees that buzzed more and more frequently past him, he walked\nalong the little path to the hut.",
      "In the very entry one bee hummed\nangrily, caught in his beard, but he carefully extricated it.",
      "Going\ninto the shady outer room, he took down from the wall his veil, that\nhung on a peg, and putting it on, and thrusting his hands into his\npockets, he went into the fenced-in bee-garden, where there stood in\nthe midst of a closely mown space in regular rows, fastened with bast\non posts, all the hives he knew so well, the old stocks, each with its\nown history, and along the fences the younger swarms hived that year.",
      "In front of the openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch\nthe bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while\namong them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of\nthem, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime\ntrees and back to the hives.",
      "His ears were filled with the incessant hum in various notes, now the\nbusy hum of the working bee flying quickly off, then the blaring of the\nlazy drone, and the excited buzz of the bees on guard protecting their\nproperty from the enemy and preparing to sting.",
      "On the farther side of\nthe fence the old bee-keeper was shaving a hoop for a tub, and he did\nnot see Levin.",
      "Levin stood still in the midst of the beehives and did\nnot call him.",
      "He was glad of a chance to be alone to recover from the influence of\nordinary actual life, which had already depressed his happy mood.",
      "He\nthought that he had already had time to lose his temper with Ivan, to\nshow coolness to his brother, and to talk flippantly with Katavasov.",
      "Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no\ntrace?",
      "he thought.",
      "But the same instant, going back to his mood, he\nfelt with delight that something new and important had happened to him.",
      "Real life had only for a time overcast the spiritual peace he had\nfound, but it was still untouched within him.",
      "Just as the bees, whirling round him, now menacing him and distracting\nhis attention, prevented him from enjoying complete physical peace,\nforced him to restrain his movements to avoid them, so had the petty\ncares that had swarmed about him from the moment he got into the trap\nrestricted his spiritual freedom; but that lasted only so long as he\nwas among them.",
      "Just as his bodily strength was still unaffected, in\nspite of the bees, so too was the spiritual strength that he had just\nbecome aware of.",
      "Chapter 15\n\n Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his way\nhere?",
      "said Dolly, doling out cucumbers and honey to the children;\n with Vronsky!",
      "He s going to Servia.",
      "And not alone; he s taking a squadron out with him at his own\nexpense,  said Katavasov.",
      "That s the right thing for him,  said Levin.",
      "Are volunteers still\ngoing out then?",
      "he added, glancing at Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch did not answer.",
      "He was carefully with a blunt knife\ngetting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white\nhoneycomb.",
      "I should think so!",
      "You should have seen what was going on at the\nstation yesterday!",
      "said Katavasov, biting with a juicy sound into a\ncucumber.",
      "Well, what is one to make of it?",
      "For mercy s sake, do explain to me,\nSergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they\nfighting with?",
      "asked the old prince, unmistakably taking up a\nconversation that had sprung up in Levin s absence.",
      "With the Turks,  Sergey Ivanovitch answered, smiling serenely, as he\nextricated the bee, dark with honey and helplessly kicking, and put it\nwith the knife on a stout aspen leaf.",
      "But who has declared war on the Turks?",
      "Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and\nCountess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?",
      "No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors \nsufferings and are eager to help them,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "But the prince is not speaking of help,  said Levin, coming to the\nassistance of his father-in-law,  but of war.",
      "The prince says that\nprivate persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the\ngovernment.",
      "Kostya, mind, that s a bee!",
      "Really, they ll sting us!",
      "said Dolly,\nwaving away a wasp.",
      "But that s not a bee, it s a wasp,  said Levin.",
      "Well now, well, what s your own theory?",
      "Katavasov said to Levin with\na smile, distinctly challenging him to a discussion.",
      "Why have not\nprivate persons the right to do so?",
      "Oh, my theory s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and\nawful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can\nindividually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;\nthat can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this,\nand is driven inevitably into war.",
      "On the other hand, both political\nscience and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and\nespecially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their\npersonal individual will.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov had their replies ready, and both began\nspeaking at the same time.",
      "But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the\ngovernment does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the\npublic asserts its will,  said Katavasov.",
      "But evidently Sergey Ivanovitch did not approve of this answer.",
      "His\nbrows contracted at Katavasov s words and he said something else.",
      "You don t put the matter in its true light.",
      "There is no question here\nof a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian\nfeeling.",
      "Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being\nmassacred.",
      "Even supposing they were not our brothers nor\nfellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is\naroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.",
      "Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a\nwoman or a child I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war\nhad been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and\nprotect the victim.",
      "But I should not kill them,  said Levin.",
      "Yes, you would kill them.",
      "I don t know.",
      "If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the\nmoment, but I can t say beforehand.",
      "And such a momentary impulse there\nis not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the\nSlavonic peoples.",
      "Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,  said Sergey\nIvanovitch, frowning with displeasure.",
      "There are traditions still\nextant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the\nyoke of the  unclean sons of Hagar.",
      "The people have heard of the\nsufferings of their brethren and have spoken.",
      "Perhaps so,  said Levin evasively;  but I don t see it.",
      "I m one of the\npeople myself, and I don t feel it.",
      "Here am I too,  said the old prince.",
      "I ve been staying abroad and\nreading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian\natrocities, I couldn t make out why it was all the Russians were all of\na sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn t feel the\nslightest affection for them.",
      "I was very much upset, thought I was a\nmonster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me.",
      "But since I\nhave been here, my mind s been set at rest.",
      "I see that there are people\nbesides me who re only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic\nbrethren.",
      "Here s Konstantin too.",
      "Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,  said Sergey\nIvanovitch;  it s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia the\nwhole people has expressed its will.",
      "But excuse me, I don t see that.",
      "The people don t know anything about\nit, if you come to that,  said the old prince.",
      "Oh, papa!...",
      "how can you say that?",
      "And last Sunday in church?",
      "said\nDolly, listening to the conversation.",
      "Please give me a cloth,  she\nsaid to the old man, who was looking at the children with a smile.",
      "Why, it s not possible that all....",
      "But what was it in church on Sunday?",
      "The priest had been told to read\nthat.",
      "He read it.",
      "They didn t understand a word of it.",
      "Then they were\ntold that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church;\nwell, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they\ncouldn t say.",
      "The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is\nalways in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense\nfinds utterance,  said Sergey Ivanovitch with conviction, glancing at\nthe old bee-keeper.",
      "The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair,\nstood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height\nof his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously\nunderstanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to\nunderstand it.",
      "That s so, no doubt,  he said, with a significant shake of his head at\nSergey Ivanovitch s words.",
      "Here, then, ask him.",
      "He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing, \nsaid Levin.",
      "Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch?",
      "he said, turning\nto him.",
      "What they read in the church?",
      "What do you think about it?",
      "Ought we to fight for the Christians?",
      "What should we think?",
      "Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought\nfor us; he thinks for us indeed in all things.",
      "It s clearer for him to\nsee.",
      "Shall I bring a bit more bread?",
      "Give the little lad some more?",
      "he\nsaid addressing Darya Alexandrovna and pointing to Grisha, who had\nfinished his crust.",
      "I don t need to ask,  said Sergey Ivanovitch,  we have seen and are\nseeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve\na just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly\nexpress their thought and aim.",
      "They bring their halfpence or go\nthemselves and say directly what for.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "It means, to my thinking,  said Levin, who was beginning to get warm,\n that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not\nhundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste,\nne er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere to Pogatchev s\nbands, to Khiva, to Servia....",
      "I tell you that it s not a case of hundreds or of ne er-do-wells, but\nthe best representatives of the people!",
      "said Sergey Ivanovitch, with\nas much irritation as if he were defending the last penny of his\nfortune.",
      "And what of the subscriptions?",
      "In this case it is a whole\npeople directly expressing their will.",
      "That word  people  is so vague,  said Levin.",
      "Parish clerks, teachers,\nand one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it s all about.",
      "The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing\ntheir will, haven t the faintest idea what there is for them to express\ntheir will about.",
      "What right have we to say that this is the people s\nwill?",
      "Chapter 16\n\nSergey Ivanovitch, being practiced in argument, did not reply, but at\nonce turned the conversation to another aspect of the subject.",
      "Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical\ncomputation, of course it s very difficult to arrive at it.",
      "And voting\nhas not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does\nnot express the will of the people; but there are other ways of\nreaching that.",
      "It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart.",
      "I won t\nspeak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the\npeople, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at\nsociety in the narrow sense.",
      "All the most diverse sections of the\neducated public, hostile before, are merged in one.",
      "Every division is\nat an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over\nagain, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is\ncarrying them in one direction.",
      "Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,  said the prince.",
      "That s true.",
      "But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak\nbefore a storm.",
      "One can hear nothing for them.",
      "Frogs or no frogs, I m not the editor of a paper and I don t want to\ndefend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual\nworld,  said Sergey Ivanovitch, addressing his brother.",
      "Levin would\nhave answered, but the old prince interrupted him.",
      "Well, about that unanimity, that s another thing, one may say,  said\nthe prince.",
      "There s my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevitch, you know him.",
      "He s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or\nother, I don t remember.",
      "Only there s nothing to do in it why, Dolly,\nit s no secret!",
      "and a salary of eight thousand.",
      "You try asking him\nwhether his post is of use, he ll prove to you that it s most\nnecessary.",
      "And he s a truthful man too, but there s no refusing to\nbelieve in the utility of eight thousand roubles.",
      "Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the\npost,  said Sergey Ivanovitch reluctantly, feeling the prince s remark\nto be ill-timed.",
      "So it is with the unanimity of the press.",
      "That s been explained to me:\nas soon as there s war their incomes are doubled.",
      "How can they help\nbelieving in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and\nall that?",
      "I don t care for many of the papers, but that s unjust,  said Sergey\nIvanovitch.",
      "I would only make one condition,  pursued the old prince.",
      "Alphonse\nKarr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia:  You consider\nwar to be inevitable?",
      "Very good.",
      "Let everyone who advocates war be\nenrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of\nevery storm, of every attack, to lead them all!",
      "A nice lot the editors would make!",
      "said Katavasov, with a loud roar,\nas he pictured the editors he knew in this picked legion.",
      "But they d run,  said Dolly,  they d only be in the way.",
      "Oh, if they ran away, then we d have grape-shot or Cossacks with whips\nbehind them,  said the prince.",
      "But that s a joke, and a poor one too, if you ll excuse my saying so,\nprince,  said Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I don t see that it was a joke, that....  Levin was beginning, but\nSergey Ivanovitch interrupted him.",
      "Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work, \nsaid he.",
      "And men of thought are doing their work when they express\npublic opinion.",
      "And the single-hearted and full expression of public\nopinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at\nthe same time.",
      "Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we\nhave heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as\none man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that\nis a great step and a proof of strength.",
      "But it s not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,  said Levin\ntimidly.",
      "The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices\nfor their soul, but not for murder,  he added, instinctively connecting\nthe conversation with the ideas that had been absorbing his mind.",
      "For their soul?",
      "That s a most puzzling expression for a natural\nscience man, do you understand?",
      "What sort of thing is the soul?",
      "said\nKatavasov, smiling.",
      "Oh, you know!",
      "No, by God, I haven t the faintest idea!",
      "said Katavasov with a loud\nroar of laughter.",
      "I bring not peace, but a sword,  says Christ,  Sergey Ivanovitch\nrejoined for his part, quoting as simply as though it were the easiest\nthing to understand the very passage that had always puzzled Levin\nmost.",
      "That s so, no doubt,  the old man repeated again.",
      "He was standing near\nthem and responded to a chance glance turned in his direction.",
      "Ah, my dear fellow, you re defeated, utterly defeated!",
      "cried\nKatavasov good-humoredly.",
      "Levin reddened with vexation, not at being defeated, but at having\nfailed to control himself and being drawn into argument.",
      "No, I can t argue with them,  he thought;  they wear impenetrable\narmor, while I m naked.",
      "He saw that it was impossible to convince his brother and Katavasov,\nand he saw even less possibility of himself agreeing with them.",
      "What\nthey advocated was the very pride of intellect that had almost been his\nruin.",
      "He could not admit that some dozens of men, among them his\nbrother, had the right, on the ground of what they were told by some\nhundreds of glib volunteers swarming to the capital, to say that they\nand the newspapers were expressing the will and feeling of the people,\nand a feeling which was expressed in vengeance and murder.",
      "He could not\nadmit this, because he neither saw the expression of such feelings in\nthe people among whom he was living, nor found them in himself (and he\ncould not but consider himself one of the persons making up the Russian\npeople), and most of all because he, like the people, did not know and\ncould not know what is for the general good, though he knew beyond a\ndoubt that this general good could be attained only by the strict\nobservance of that law of right and wrong which has been revealed to\nevery man, and therefore he could not wish for war or advocate war for\nany general objects whatever.",
      "He said as Mihalitch did and the people,\nwho had expressed their feeling in the traditional invitations of the\nVaryagi:  Be princes and rule over us.",
      "Gladly we promise complete\nsubmission.",
      "All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take\nupon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.",
      "And now, according\nto Sergey Ivanovitch s account, the people had foregone this privilege\nthey had bought at such a costly price.",
      "He wanted to say too that if public opinion were an infallible guide,\nthen why were not revolutions and the commune as lawful as the movement\nin favor of the Slavonic peoples?",
      "But these were merely thoughts that\ncould settle nothing.",
      "One thing could be seen beyond doubt that was\nthat at the actual moment the discussion was irritating Sergey\nIvanovitch, and so it was wrong to continue it.",
      "And Levin ceased\nspeaking and then called the attention of his guests to the fact that\nthe storm clouds were gathering, and that they had better be going home\nbefore it rained.",
      "Chapter 17\n\nThe old prince and Sergey Ivanovitch got into the trap and drove off;\nthe rest of the party hastened homewards on foot.",
      "But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so\nquickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the\nrain.",
      "The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke,\nrushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky.",
      "They were still two\nhundred paces from home and a gust of wind had already blown up, and\nevery second the downpour might be looked for.",
      "The children ran ahead with frightened and gleeful shrieks.",
      "Darya\nAlexandrovna, struggling painfully with her skirts that clung round her\nlegs, was not walking, but running, her eyes fixed on the children.",
      "The\nmen of the party, holding their hats on, strode with long steps beside\nher.",
      "They were just at the steps when a big drop fell splashing on the\nedge of the iron guttering.",
      "The children and their elders after them\nran into the shelter of the house, talking merrily.",
      "Katerina Alexandrovna?",
      "Levin asked of Agafea Mihalovna, who met them\nwith kerchiefs and rugs in the hall.",
      "We thought she was with you,  she said.",
      "And Mitya?",
      "In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.",
      "Levin snatched up the rugs and ran towards the copse.",
      "In that brief interval of time the storm clouds had moved on, covering\nthe sun so completely that it was dark as an eclipse.",
      "Stubbornly, as\nthough insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the\nleaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch\nbranches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one\nside acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops.",
      "The\npeasant girls working in the garden ran shrieking into shelter in the\nservants  quarters.",
      "The streaming rain had already flung its white veil\nover all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was\nrapidly swooping down upon the copse.",
      "The wet of the rain spurting up\nin tiny drops could be smelt in the air.",
      "Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind\nthat strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the\ncopse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree,\nwhen there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the\nvault of heaven seemed crashing overhead.",
      "Opening his blinded eyes,\nLevin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from\nthe copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest\nof the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing\nits position.",
      "Can it have been struck?",
      "Levin hardly had time to think\nwhen, moving more and more rapidly, the oak tree vanished behind the\nother trees, and he heard the crash of the great tree falling upon the\nothers.",
      "The flash of lightning, the crash of thunder, and the instantaneous\nchill that ran through him were all merged for Levin in one sense of\nterror.",
      "My God!",
      "my God!",
      "not on them!",
      "he said.",
      "And though he thought at once how senseless was his prayer that they\nshould not have been killed by the oak which had fallen now, he\nrepeated it, knowing that he could do nothing better than utter this\nsenseless prayer.",
      "Running up to the place where they usually went, he did not find them\nthere.",
      "They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree; they\nwere calling him.",
      "Two figures in dark dresses (they had been light\nsummer dresses when they started out) were standing bending over\nsomething.",
      "It was Kitty with the nurse.",
      "The rain was already ceasing,\nand it was beginning to get light when Levin reached them.",
      "The nurse\nwas not wet on the lower part of her dress, but Kitty was drenched\nthrough, and her soaked clothes clung to her.",
      "Though the rain was over,\nthey still stood in the same position in which they had been standing\nwhen the storm broke.",
      "Both stood bending over a perambulator with a\ngreen umbrella.",
      "Alive?",
      "Unhurt?",
      "Thank God!",
      "he said, splashing with his soaked boots\nthrough the standing water and running up to them.",
      "Kitty s rosy wet face was turned towards him, and she smiled timidly\nunder her shapeless sopped hat.",
      "Aren t you ashamed of yourself?",
      "I can t think how you can be so\nreckless!",
      "he said angrily to his wife.",
      "It wasn t my fault, really.",
      "We were just meaning to go, when he made\nsuch a to-do that we had to change him.",
      "We were just....  Kitty began\ndefending herself.",
      "Mitya was unharmed, dry, and still fast asleep.",
      "Well, thank God!",
      "I don t know what I m saying!",
      "They gathered up the baby s wet belongings; the nurse picked up the\nbaby and carried it.",
      "Levin walked beside his wife, and, penitent for\nhaving been angry, he squeezed her hand when the nurse was not looking.",
      "Chapter 18\n\nDuring the whole of that day, in the extremely different conversations\nin which he took part, only as it were with the top layer of his mind,\nin spite of the disappointment of not finding the change he expected in\nhimself, Levin had been all the while joyfully conscious of the fulness\nof his heart.",
      "After the rain it was too wet to go for a walk; besides, the storm\nclouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black\nand thundery, on the rim of the sky.",
      "The whole party spent the rest of\nthe day in the house.",
      "No more discussions sprang up; on the contrary, after dinner everyone\nwas in the most amiable frame of mind.",
      "At first Katavasov amused the ladies by his original jokes, which\nalways pleased people on their first acquaintance with him.",
      "Then Sergey\nIvanovitch induced him to tell them about the very interesting\nobservations he had made on the habits and characteristics of common\nhouseflies, and their life.",
      "Sergey Ivanovitch, too, was in good\nspirits, and at tea his brother drew him on to explain his views of the\nfuture of the Eastern question, and he spoke so simply and so well,\nthat everyone listened eagerly.",
      "Kitty was the only one who did not hear it all she was summoned to give\nMitya his bath.",
      "A few minutes after Kitty had left the room she sent for Levin to come\nto the nursery.",
      "Leaving his tea, and regretfully interrupting the interesting\nconversation, and at the same time uneasily wondering why he had been\nsent for, as this only happened on important occasions, Levin went to\nthe nursery.",
      "Although he had been much interested by Sergey Ivanovitch s views of\nthe new epoch in history that would be created by the emancipation of\nforty millions of men of Slavonic race acting with Russia, a conception\nquite new to him, and although he was disturbed by uneasy wonder at\nbeing sent for by Kitty, as soon as he came out of the drawing-room and\nwas alone, his mind reverted at once to the thoughts of the morning.",
      "And all the theories of the significance of the Slav element in the\nhistory of the world seemed to him so trivial compared with what was\npassing in his own soul, that he instantly forgot it all and dropped\nback into the same frame of mind that he had been in that morning.",
      "He did not, as he had done at other times, recall the whole train of\nthought that he did not need.",
      "He fell back at once into the feeling\nwhich had guided him, which was connected with those thoughts, and he\nfound that feeling in his soul even stronger and more definite than\nbefore.",
      "He did not, as he had had to do with previous attempts to find\ncomforting arguments, need to revive a whole chain of thought to find\nthe feeling.",
      "Now, on the contrary, the feeling of joy and peace was\nkeener than ever, and thought could not keep pace with feeling.",
      "He walked across the terrace and looked at two stars that had come out\nin the darkening sky, and suddenly he remembered.",
      "Yes, looking at the\nsky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I\nthought something, I shirked facing something,  he mused.",
      "But whatever\nit was, there can be no disproving it!",
      "I have but to think, and all\nwill come clear!",
      "Just as he was going into the nursery he remembered what it was he had\nshirked facing.",
      "It was that if the chief proof of the Divinity was His\nrevelation of what is right, how is it this revelation is confined to\nthe Christian church alone?",
      "What relation to this revelation have the\nbeliefs of the Buddhists, Mohammedans, who preached and did good too?",
      "It seemed to him that he had an answer to this question; but he had not\ntime to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.",
      "Kitty was standing with her sleeves tucked up over the baby in the\nbath.",
      "Hearing her husband s footstep, she turned towards him, summoning\nhim to her with her smile.",
      "With one hand she was supporting the fat\nbaby that lay floating and sprawling on its back, while with the other\nshe squeezed the sponge over him.",
      "Come, look, look!",
      "she said, when her husband came up to her.",
      "Agafea\nMihalovna s right.",
      "He knows us!",
      "Mitya had on that day given unmistakable, incontestable signs of\nrecognizing all his friends.",
      "As soon as Levin approached the bath, the experiment was tried, and it\nwas completely successful.",
      "The cook, sent for with this object, bent\nover the baby.",
      "He frowned and shook his head disapprovingly.",
      "Kitty bent\ndown to him, he gave her a beaming smile, propped his little hands on\nthe sponge and chirruped, making such a queer little contented sound\nwith his lips, that Kitty and the nurse were not alone in their\nadmiration.",
      "Levin, too, was surprised and delighted.",
      "The baby was taken out of the bath, drenched with water, wrapped in\ntowels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother.",
      "Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him,  said Kitty to her\nhusband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place,\nwith the baby at her breast.",
      "I am so glad!",
      "It had begun to distress\nme.",
      "You said you had no feeling for him.",
      "No; did I say that?",
      "I only said I was disappointed.",
      "What!",
      "disappointed in him?",
      "Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more.",
      "I\nhad expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.",
      "And then instead of that disgust, pity.... \n\nShe listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put\nback on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving\nMitya his bath.",
      "And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than\npleasure.",
      "Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand how I\nlove him.",
      "Kitty s smile was radiant.",
      "Were you very much frightened?",
      "she said.",
      "So was I too, but I feel it\nmore now that it s over.",
      "I m going to look at the oak.",
      "How nice\nKatavasov is!",
      "And what a happy day we ve had altogether.",
      "And you re so\nnice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when you care to be.... Well, go back to\nthem.",
      "It s always so hot and steamy here after the bath.",
      "Chapter 19\n\nGoing out of the nursery and being again alone, Levin went back at once\nto the thought, in which there was something not clear.",
      "Instead of going into the drawing-room, where he heard voices, he\nstopped on the terrace, and leaning his elbows on the parapet, he gazed\nup at the sky.",
      "It was quite dark now, and in the south, where he was looking, there\nwere no clouds.",
      "The storm had drifted on to the opposite side of the\nsky, and there were flashes of lightning and distant thunder from that\nquarter.",
      "Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in\nthe garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and\nthe Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst.",
      "At each\nflash of lightning the Milky Way, and even the bright stars, vanished,\nbut as soon as the lightning died away, they reappeared in their places\nas though some hand had flung them back with careful aim.",
      "Well, what is it perplexes me?",
      "Levin said to himself, feeling\nbeforehand that the solution of his difficulties was ready in his soul,\nthough he did not know it yet.",
      "Yes, the one unmistakable,\nincontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and\nwrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in\nmyself, and in the recognition of which I don t make myself, but\nwhether I will or not I am made one with other men in one body of\nbelievers, which is called the church.",
      "Well, but the Jews, the\nMohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists what of them?",
      "he put to\nhimself the question he had feared to face.",
      "Can these hundreds of\nmillions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life\nhas no meaning?",
      "He pondered a moment, but immediately corrected\nhimself.",
      "But what am I questioning?",
      "he said to himself.",
      "I am\nquestioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of\nall mankind.",
      "I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all\nthe world with all those misty blurs.",
      "What am I about?",
      "To me\nindividually, to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all\ndoubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to\nexpress that knowledge in reason and words.",
      "Don t I know that the stars don t move?",
      "he asked himself, gazing at\nthe bright planet which had shifted its position up to the topmost twig\nof the birch-tree.",
      "But looking at the movements of the stars, I can t\npicture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I m right in saying\nthat the stars move.",
      "And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if\nthey had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of\nthe earth?",
      "All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the\ndistances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies\nare only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a\nstationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has\nbeen so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be\nalways alike, and can always be trusted.",
      "And just as the conclusions of\nthe astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on\nobservations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and\na single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not\nfounded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always\nalike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and\nwhich can always be trusted in my soul.",
      "The question of other religions\nand their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no\npossibility of deciding.",
      "Oh, you haven t gone in then?",
      "he heard Kitty s voice all at once, as\nshe came by the same way to the drawing-room.",
      "What is it?",
      "you re not worried about anything?",
      "she said, looking\nintently at his face in the starlight.",
      "But she could not have seen his face if a flash of lightning had not\nhidden the stars and revealed it.",
      "In that flash she saw his face\ndistinctly, and seeing him calm and happy, she smiled at him.",
      "She understands,  he thought;  she knows what I m thinking about.",
      "Shall I tell her or not?",
      "Yes, I ll tell her.",
      "But at the moment he was\nabout to speak, she began speaking.",
      "Kostya!",
      "do something for me,  she said;  go into the corner room and\nsee if they ve made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch.",
      "I can t very\nwell.",
      "See if they ve put the new wash stand in it.",
      "Very well, I ll go directly,  said Levin, standing up and kissing her.",
      "No, I d better not speak of it,  he thought, when she had gone in\nbefore him.",
      "It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me,\nand not to be put into words.",
      "This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and\nenlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling\nfor my child.",
      "There was no surprise in this either.",
      "Faith or not\nfaith I don t know what it is but this feeling has come just as\nimperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.",
      "I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the\ncoachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions\ntactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of\nholies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on\nscolding her for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall\nstill be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall\nstill go on praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything\nthat can happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it\nwas before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have\nthe power to put into it."

      "Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "I said.",
      "A nod was the answer.",
      "Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.",
      "I do myself the honour of calling\nas soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have\nnot inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation\nof Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts \n\n Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,  he interrupted, wincing.",
      "I should\nnot allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it walk in!",
      "The  walk in  was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the\nsentiment,  Go to the Deuce!",
      "even the gate over which he leant\nmanifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that\ncircumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested\nin a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.",
      "When he saw my horse s breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put\nout his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the\ncauseway, calling, as we entered the court, Joseph, take Mr.\nLockwood s horse; and bring up some wine.",
      "Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,  was the\nreflection suggested by this compound order.",
      "No wonder the grass grows\nup between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.",
      "Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man, very old, perhaps, though hale\nand sinewy.",
      "The Lord help us!",
      "he soliloquised in an undertone of\npeevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\nin my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\ndivine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\nreference to my unexpected advent.",
      "Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff s dwelling.",
      "Wuthering \nbeing a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the\natmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.",
      "Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed:\none may guess the power of the north wind, blowing over the edge, by\nthe excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and\nby a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if\ncraving alms of the sun.",
      "Happily, the architect had foresight to build\nit strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the\ncorners defended with large jutting stones.",
      "Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of\ngrotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the\nprincipal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins\nand shameless little boys, I detected the date  1500,  and the name\n Hareton Earnshaw.",
      "I would have made a few comments, and requested a\nshort history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at\nthe door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure,\nand I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting\nthe penetralium.",
      "One step brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\nintroductory lobby or passage: they call it here  the house \npre-eminently.",
      "It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I\nbelieve at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat\naltogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of\ntongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I\nobserved no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge\nfireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on\nthe walls.",
      "One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat\nfrom ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and\ntankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very\nroof.",
      "The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay\nbare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with\noatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it.",
      "Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of\nhorse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily painted canisters\ndisposed along its ledge.",
      "The floor was of smooth, white stone; the\nchairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two\nheavy black ones lurking in the shade.",
      "In an arch under the dresser\nreposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of\nsquealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.",
      "The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\nbelonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance,\nand stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.",
      "Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on\nthe round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six\nmiles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.",
      "But\nMr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of\nliving.",
      "He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a\ngentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire:\nrather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence,\nbecause he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.",
      "Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred\npride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of\nthe sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to\nshowy displays of feeling to manifestations of mutual kindliness.",
      "He ll\nlove and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of\nimpertinence to be loved or hated again.",
      "No, I m running on too fast: I\nbestow my own attributes over-liberally on him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff may have\nentirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he\nmeets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me.",
      "Let me hope\nmy constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should\nnever have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself\nperfectly unworthy of one.",
      "While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\ninto the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\neyes, as long as she took no notice of me.",
      "I  never told my love \nvocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\nguessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked\na return the sweetest of all imaginable looks.",
      "And what did I do?",
      "I\nconfess it with shame shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\nglance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was\nled to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her\nsupposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.",
      "By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of\ndeliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate.",
      "I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\nmy landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by\nattempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and\nwas sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and\nher white teeth watering for a snatch.",
      "My caress provoked a long,\nguttural gnarl.",
      "You d better let the dog alone,  growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\nchecking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.",
      "She s not\naccustomed to be spoiled not kept for a pet.",
      "Then, striding to a side\ndoor, he shouted again,  Joseph!",
      "Joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\nintimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n_vis- -vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\nwho shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.",
      "Not\nanxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but,\nimagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately\nindulged in winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my\nphysiognomy so irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and\nleapt on my knees.",
      "I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the\ntable between us.",
      "This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen\nfour-footed fiends, of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens\nto the common centre.",
      "I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects\nof assault; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I\ncould with the poker, I was constrained to demand, aloud, assistance\nfrom some of the household in re-establishing peace.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\nphlegm: I don t think they moved one second faster than usual, though\nthe hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.",
      "Happily, an\ninhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch; a lusty dame, with\ntucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\nmidst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\ntongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she\nonly remained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master\nentered on the scene.",
      "What the devil is the matter?",
      "he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\ncould ill endure after this inhospitable treatment.",
      "What the devil, indeed!",
      "I muttered.",
      "The herd of possessed swine\ncould have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours,\nsir.",
      "You might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!",
      "They won t meddle with persons who touch nothing,  he remarked,\nputting the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.",
      "The\ndogs do right to be vigilant.",
      "Take a glass of wine?",
      "No, thank you.",
      "Not bitten, are you?",
      "If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.",
      "Heathcliff s\ncountenance relaxed into a grin.",
      "Come, come,  he said,  you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.",
      "Here, take a\nlittle wine.",
      "Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\ndogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.",
      "Your\nhealth, sir?",
      "I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\nfoolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides,\nI felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since\nhis humour took that turn.",
      "He probably swayed by prudential\nconsideration of the folly of offending a good tenant relaxed a little\nin the laconic style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs,\nand introduced what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me, a\ndiscourse on the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of\nretirement.",
      "I found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and\nbefore I went home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another\nvisit to-morrow.",
      "He evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.",
      "I\nshall go, notwithstanding.",
      "It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself\ncompared with him.",
      "CHAPTER II\n\n\nYesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.",
      "I had half a mind to spend\nit by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to\nWuthering Heights.",
      "On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.",
      "I dine\nbetween twelve and one o clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken\nas a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend\nmy request that I might be served at five) on mounting the stairs with\nthis lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl\non her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an\ninfernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.",
      "This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a\nfour-miles  walk, arrived at Heathcliff s garden-gate just in time to\nescape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower.",
      "On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the\nair made me shiver through every limb.",
      "Being unable to remove the\nchain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered\nwith straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till\nmy knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.",
      "Wretched inmates!",
      "I ejaculated, mentally,  you deserve perpetual\nisolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality.",
      "At least,\nI would not keep my doors barred in the day-time.",
      "I don t care I will\nget in!",
      "So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.",
      "Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the\nbarn.",
      "What are ye for?",
      "he shouted.",
      "T  maister s down i  t  fowld.",
      "Go round\nby th  end o  t  laith, if ye went to spake to him.",
      "Is there nobody inside to open the door?",
      "I hallooed, responsively.",
      "There s nobbut t  missis; and shoo ll not oppen  t an ye mak  yer\nflaysome dins till neeght.",
      "Why?",
      "Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?",
      "Nor-ne me!",
      "I ll hae no hend wi t,  muttered the head, vanishing.",
      "The snow began to drive thickly.",
      "I seized the handle to essay another\ntrial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\nappeared in the yard behind.",
      "He hailed me to follow him, and, after\nmarching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\npump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\napartment where I was formerly received.",
      "It glowed delightfully in the\nradiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and\nnear the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to\nobserve the  missis,  an individual whose existence I had never\npreviously suspected.",
      "I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me\ntake a seat.",
      "She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained\nmotionless and mute.",
      "Rough weather!",
      "I remarked.",
      "I m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door\nmust bear the consequence of your servants  leisure attendance: I had\nhard work to make them hear me.",
      "She never opened her mouth.",
      "I stared she stared also: at any rate, she\nkept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\nembarrassing and disagreeable.",
      "Sit down,  said the young man, gruffly.",
      "He ll be in soon.",
      "I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\nsecond interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of\nowning my acquaintance.",
      "A beautiful animal!",
      "I commenced again.",
      "Do you intend parting with\nthe little ones, madam?",
      "They are not mine,  said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\nHeathcliff himself could have replied.",
      "Ah, your favourites are among these?",
      "I continued, turning to an\nobscure cushion full of something like cats.",
      "A strange choice of favourites!",
      "she observed scornfully.",
      "Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.",
      "I hemmed once more, and drew\ncloser to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\nevening.",
      "You should not have come out,  she said, rising and reaching from the\nchimney-piece two of the painted canisters.",
      "Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\nview of her whole figure and countenance.",
      "She was slender, and\napparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\nexquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\nsmall features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\nloose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\nexpression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\nsusceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between\nscorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected\nthere.",
      "The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to\naid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted\nto assist him in counting his gold.",
      "I don t want your help,  she snapped;  I can get them for myself.",
      "I beg your pardon!",
      "I hastened to reply.",
      "Were you asked to tea?",
      "she demanded, tying an apron over her neat\nblack frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the\npot.",
      "I shall be glad to have a cup,  I answered.",
      "Were you asked?",
      "she repeated.",
      "No,  I said, half smiling.",
      "You are the proper person to ask me.",
      "She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\nher forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a\nchild s ready to cry.",
      "Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\nupper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on\nme from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\nmortal feud unavenged between us.",
      "I began to doubt whether he were a\nservant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\nthe superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\ncurls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly\nover his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common\nlabourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed\nnone of a domestic s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.",
      "In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to\nabstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes\nafterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure,\nfrom my uncomfortable state.",
      "You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!",
      "I exclaimed, assuming\nthe cheerful;  and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if\nyou can afford me shelter during that space.",
      "Half an hour?",
      "he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes;  I\nwonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.",
      "Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?",
      "People\nfamiliar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\ncan tell you there is no chance of a change at present.",
      "Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\nGrange till morning could you spare me one?",
      "No, I could not.",
      "Oh, indeed!",
      "Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.",
      "Umph!",
      "Are you going to mak  the tea?",
      "demanded he of the shabby coat,\nshifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.",
      "Is _he_ to have any?",
      "she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.",
      "Get it ready, will you?",
      "was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\nstarted.",
      "The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\nnature.",
      "I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.",
      "When the preparations were finished, he invited me with Now, sir,\nbring forward your chair.",
      "And we all, including the rustic youth, drew\nround the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our\nmeal.",
      "I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort\nto dispel it.",
      "They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it\nwas impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal\nscowl they wore was their every-day countenance.",
      "It is strange,  I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea\nand receiving another it is strange how custom can mould our tastes\nand ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life\nof such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff;\nyet, I ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with\nyour amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart \n\n My amiable lady!",
      "he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on\nhis face.",
      "Where is she my amiable lady?",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.",
      "Well, yes oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of\nministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even\nwhen her body is gone.",
      "Is that it?",
      "Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.",
      "I might have\nseen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\nmake it likely that they were man and wife.",
      "One was about forty: a\nperiod of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of\nbeing married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace\nof our declining years.",
      "The other did not look seventeen.",
      "Then it flashed upon me The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea\nout of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her\nhusband: Heathcliff junior, of course.",
      "Here is the consequence of being\nburied alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer\nignorance that better individuals existed!",
      "A sad pity I must beware how\nI cause her to regret her choice.",
      "The last reflection may seem\nconceited; it was not.",
      "My neighbour struck me as bordering on\nrepulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,  said Heathcliff, corroborating\nmy surmise.",
      "He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\nlook of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles\nthat will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of\nhis soul.",
      "Ah, certainly I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\nbeneficent fairy,  I remarked, turning to my neighbour.",
      "This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\nfist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.",
      "But he seemed to\nrecollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\nmuttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.",
      "Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,  observed my host;  we neither of us\nhave the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.",
      "I said\nshe was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.",
      "And this young man is \n\n Not my son, assuredly.",
      "Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to\nattribute the paternity of that bear to him.",
      "My name is Hareton Earnshaw,  growled the other;  and I d counsel you\nto respect it!",
      "I ve shown no disrespect,  was my reply, laughing internally at the\ndignity with which he announced himself.",
      "He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for\nfear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity\naudible.",
      "I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant\nfamily circle.",
      "The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than\nneutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to\nbe cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.",
      "The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\nsociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.",
      "A\nsorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\nhills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.",
      "I don t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,  I\ncould not help exclaiming.",
      "The roads will be buried already; and, if\nthey were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.",
      "Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.",
      "They ll be\ncovered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them, \nsaid Heathcliff.",
      "How must I do?",
      "I continued, with rising irritation.",
      "There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only\nJoseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff\nleaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of\nmatches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the\ntea-canister to its place.",
      "The former, when he had deposited his\nburden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated\nout Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i  idleness un war,\nwhen all on  ems goan out!",
      "Bud yah re a nowt, and it s no use\ntalking yah ll niver mend o yer ill ways, but goa raight to t  divil,\nlike yer mother afore ye!",
      "I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to\nme; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an\nintention of kicking him out of the door.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, however,\nchecked me by her answer.",
      "You scandalous old hypocrite!",
      "she replied.",
      "Are you not afraid of\nbeing carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil s name?",
      "I\nwarn you to refrain from provoking me, or I ll ask your abduction as a\nspecial favour!",
      "Stop!",
      "look here, Joseph,  she continued, taking a long,\ndark book from a shelf;  I ll show you how far I ve progressed in the\nBlack Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it.",
      "The\nred cow didn t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be\nreckoned among providential visitations!",
      "Oh, wicked, wicked!",
      "gasped the elder;  may the Lord deliver us from\nevil!",
      "No, reprobate!",
      "you are a castaway be off, or I ll hurt you seriously!",
      "I ll have you all modelled in wax and clay!",
      "and the first who passes\nthe limits I fix shall I ll not say what he shall be done to but,\nyou ll see!",
      "Go, I m looking at you!",
      "The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and\nJoseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and\nejaculating  wicked  as he went.",
      "I thought her conduct must be prompted\nby a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured\nto interest her in my distress.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff,  I said earnestly,  you must excuse me for troubling\nyou.",
      "I presume, because, with that face, I m sure you cannot help being\ngood-hearted.",
      "Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way\nhome: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to\nget to London!",
      "Take the road you came,  she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,\nwith a candle, and the long book open before her.",
      "It is brief advice,\nbut as sound as I can give.",
      "Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full\nof snow, your conscience won t whisper that it is partly your fault?",
      "How so?",
      "I cannot escort you.",
      "They wouldn t let me go to the end of the\ngarden wall.",
      "_You_!",
      "I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my\nconvenience, on such a night,  I cried.",
      "I want you to _tell_ me my\nway, not to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a\nguide.",
      "Who?",
      "There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.",
      "Which would you\nhave?",
      "Are there no boys at the farm?",
      "No; those are all.",
      "Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.",
      "That you may settle with your host.",
      "I have nothing to do with it.",
      "I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on\nthese hills,  cried Heathcliff s stern voice from the kitchen entrance.",
      "As to staying here, I don t keep accommodations for visitors: you must\nshare a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.",
      "I can sleep on a chair in this room,  I replied.",
      "No, no!",
      "A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit\nme to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!",
      "said\nthe unmannerly wretch.",
      "With this insult my patience was at an end.",
      "I uttered an expression of\ndisgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in\nmy haste.",
      "It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and,\nas I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour\namongst each other.",
      "At first the young man appeared about to befriend\nme.",
      "I ll go with him as far as the park,  he said.",
      "You ll go with him to hell!",
      "exclaimed his master, or whatever\nrelation he bore.",
      "And who is to look after the horses, eh?",
      "A man s life is of more consequence than one evening s neglect of the\nhorses: somebody must go,  murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I\nexpected.",
      "Not at your command!",
      "retorted Hareton.",
      "If you set store on him,\nyou d better be quiet.",
      "Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will\nnever get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,  she answered,\nsharply.",
      "Hearken, hearken, shoo s cursing on  em!",
      "muttered Joseph, towards\nwhom I had been steering.",
      "He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern,\nwhich I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it\nback on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.",
      "Maister, maister, he s staling t  lanthern!",
      "shouted the ancient,\npursuing my retreat.",
      "Hey, Gnasher!",
      "Hey, dog!",
      "Hey Wolf, holld him,\nholld him!",
      "On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat,\nbearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw\nfrom Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and\nhumiliation.",
      "Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching\ntheir paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me\nalive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie\ntill their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and\ntrembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out on their\nperil to keep me one minute longer with several incoherent threats of\nretaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of\nKing Lear.",
      "The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the\nnose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.",
      "I don t know\nwhat would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at\nhand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my\nentertainer.",
      "This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued\nforth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.",
      "She thought that some\nof them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack\nher master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger\nscoundrel.",
      "Well, Mr. Earnshaw,  she cried,  I wonder what you ll have agait next?",
      "Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones?",
      "I see this house\nwill never do for me look at t  poor lad, he s fair choking!",
      "Wisht,\nwisht; you mun n t go on so.",
      "Come in, and I ll cure that: there now,\nhold ye still.",
      "With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my\nneck, and pulled me into the kitchen.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff followed, his\naccidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.",
      "I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled\nperforce to accept lodgings under his roof.",
      "He told Zillah to give me a\nglass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she\ncondoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders,\nwhereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.",
      "CHAPTER III\n\n\nWhile leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the\ncandle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about\nthe chamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there\nwillingly.",
      "I asked the reason.",
      "She did not know, she answered: she had\nonly lived there a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on,\nshe could not begin to be curious.",
      "Too stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced\nround for the bed.",
      "The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a\nclothes-press, and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top\nresembling coach windows.",
      "Having approached this structure, I looked\ninside, and perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch,\nvery conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of\nthe family having a room to himself.",
      "In fact, it formed a little\ncloset, and the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a\ntable.",
      "I slid back the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them\ntogether again, and felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff,\nand every one else.",
      "The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up\nin one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.",
      "This writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of\ncharacters, large and small _Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied\nto _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.",
      "In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued\nspelling over Catherine Earnshaw Heathcliff Linton, till my eyes\nclosed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white\nletters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres the air swarmed\nwith Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I\ndiscovered my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and\nperfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.",
      "I snuffed it off, and, very ill at ease under the influence of cold and\nlingering nausea, sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee.",
      "It was a Testament, in lean type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a\nfly-leaf bore the inscription Catherine Earnshaw, her book,  and a\ndate some quarter of a century back.",
      "I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had examined all.",
      "Catherine s library was select, and its state of dilapidation proved it\nto have been well used, though not altogether for a legitimate purpose:\nscarcely one chapter had escaped a pen-and-ink commentary at least the\nappearance of one covering every morsel of blank that the printer had\nleft.",
      "Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a\nregular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish hand.",
      "At the top of an\nextra page (quite a treasure, probably, when first lighted on) I was\ngreatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend\nJoseph, rudely, yet powerfully sketched.",
      "An immediate interest kindled\nwithin me for the unknown Catherine, and I began forthwith to decipher\nher faded hieroglyphics.",
      "An awful Sunday,  commenced the paragraph beneath.",
      "I wish my father\nwere back again.",
      "Hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to\nHeathcliff is atrocious H. and I are going to rebel we took our\ninitiatory step this evening.",
      "All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so\nJoseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while\nHindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire doing\nanything but reading their Bibles, I ll answer for it Heathcliff,\nmyself, and the unhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our\nprayer-books, and mount: we were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn,\ngroaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, so\nthat he might give us a short homily for his own sake.",
      "A vain idea!",
      "The\nservice lasted precisely three hours; and yet my brother had the face\nto exclaim, when he saw us descending,  What, done already?",
      "On Sunday\nevenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not make much\nnoise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into corners.",
      "You forget you have a master here,  says the tyrant.",
      "I ll demolish\nthe first who puts me out of temper!",
      "I insist on perfect sobriety and\nsilence.",
      "Oh, boy!",
      "was that you?",
      "Frances darling, pull his hair as you\ngo by: I heard him snap his fingers.",
      "Frances pulled his hair heartily,\nand then went and seated herself on her husband s knee, and there they\nwere, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish\npalaver that we should be ashamed of.",
      "We made ourselves as snug as our\nmeans allowed in the arch of the dresser.",
      "I had just fastened our\npinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes\nJoseph, on an errand from the stables.",
      "He tears down my handiwork,\nboxes my ears, and croaks:\n\n T  maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o ered, und t  sound\no  t  gospel still i  yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!",
      "Shame on ye!",
      "sit ye down, ill childer!",
      "there s good books eneugh if ye ll read  em:\nsit ye down, and think o  yer sowls!",
      "Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might\nreceive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the\nlumber he thrust upon us.",
      "I could not bear the employment.",
      "I took my\ndingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I\nhated a good book.",
      "Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.",
      "Then there\nwas a hubbub!",
      "Maister Hindley!",
      "shouted our chaplain.",
      "Maister, coom hither!",
      "Miss\nCathy s riven th  back off  Th  Helmet o  Salvation,  un  Heathcliff s\npawsed his fit into t  first part o   T  Brooad Way to Destruction!",
      "It s fair flaysome that ye let  em go on this gait.",
      "Ech!",
      "th  owd man\nwad ha  laced  em properly but he s goan!",
      "Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of\nus by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the\nback-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated,  owd Nick  would fetch us as\nsure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate\nnook to await his advent.",
      "I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a\nshelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got\nthe time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is\nimpatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman s\ncloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter.",
      "A pleasant\nsuggestion and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his\nprophecy verified we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we\nare here.",
      "* * * * * *\n\n\nI suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took\nup another subject: she waxed lachrymose.",
      "How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!",
      "she\nwrote.",
      "My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I\ncan t give over.",
      "Poor Heathcliff!",
      "Hindley calls him a vagabond, and\nwon t let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he\nand I must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the\nhouse if we break his orders.",
      "He has been blaming our father (how dared\nhe?)",
      "for treating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to\nhis right place \n\n* * * * * *\n\n\nI began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from\nmanuscript to print.",
      "I saw a red ornamented title Seventy Times Seven,\nand the First of the Seventy-First.",
      "A Pious Discourse delivered by the\nReverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.",
      "And while\nI was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez\nBranderham would make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell\nasleep.",
      "Alas, for the effects of bad tea and bad temper!",
      "What else\ncould it be that made me pass such a terrible night?",
      "I don t remember\nanother that I can at all compare with it since I was capable of\nsuffering.",
      "I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.",
      "I thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph\nfor a guide.",
      "The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered\non, my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not\nbrought a pilgrim s staff: telling me that I could never get into the\nhouse without one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel,\nwhich I understood to be so denominated.",
      "For a moment I considered it\nabsurd that I should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own\nresidence.",
      "Then a new idea flashed across me.",
      "I was not going there: we\nwere journeying to hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the\ntext Seventy Times Seven;  and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had\ncommitted the  First of the Seventy-First,  and were to be publicly\nexposed and excommunicated.",
      "We came to the chapel.",
      "I have passed it really in my walks, twice or\nthrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow,\nnear a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes\nof embalming on the few corpses deposited there.",
      "The roof has been kept\nwhole hitherto; but as the clergyman s stipend is only twenty pounds\nper annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to\ndetermine into one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor:\nespecially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let\nhim starve than increase the living by one penny from their own\npockets.",
      "However, in my dream, Jabez had a full and attentive\ncongregation; and he preached good God!",
      "what a sermon; divided into\n_four hundred and ninety_ parts, each fully equal to an ordinary\naddress from the pulpit, and each discussing a separate sin!",
      "Where he\nsearched for them, I cannot tell.",
      "He had his private manner of\ninterpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the brother should sin\ndifferent sins on every occasion.",
      "They were of the most curious\ncharacter: odd transgressions that I never imagined previously.",
      "Oh, how weary I grew.",
      "How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and\nrevived!",
      "How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and\nstood up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he\nwould _ever_ have done.",
      "I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he\nreached the  _First of the Seventy-First_.",
      "At that crisis, a sudden\ninspiration descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez\nBranderham as the sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.",
      "Sir,  I exclaimed,  sitting here within these four walls, at one\nstretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads\nof your discourse.",
      "Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat\nand been about to depart Seventy times seven times have you\npreposterously forced me to resume my seat.",
      "The four hundred and\nninety-first is too much.",
      "Fellow-martyrs, have at him!",
      "Drag him down,\nand crush him to atoms, that the place which knows him may know him no\nmore!",
      "_Thou art the Man!_  cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over\nhis cushion.",
      "Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy\nvisage seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul Lo, this is\nhuman weakness: this also may be absolved!",
      "The First of the\nSeventy-First is come.",
      "Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.",
      "Such honour have all His saints!",
      "With that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim s\nstaves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in\nself-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most\nferocious assailant, for his.",
      "In the confluence of the multitude,\nseveral clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.",
      "Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter\nrappings: every man s hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham,\nunwilling to remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud\ntaps on the boards of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at\nlast, to my unspeakable relief, they woke me.",
      "And what was it that had\nsuggested the tremendous tumult?",
      "What had played Jabez s part in the\nrow?",
      "Merely the branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the\nblast wailed by, and rattled its dry cones against the panes!",
      "I\nlistened doubtingly an instant; detected the disturber, then turned and\ndozed, and dreamt again: if possible, still more disagreeably than\nbefore.",
      "This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard\ndistinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,\nthe fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right\ncause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if\npossible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the\ncasement.",
      "The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance\nobserved by me when awake, but forgotten.",
      "I must stop it,\nnevertheless!",
      "I muttered, knocking my knuckles through the glass, and\nstretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch; instead of\nwhich, my fingers closed on the fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!",
      "The intense horror of nightmare came over me: I tried to draw back my\narm, but the hand clung to it, and a most melancholy voice sobbed,\n\n Let me in let me in!",
      "Who are you?",
      "I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.",
      "Catherine Linton,  it replied, shiveringly (why did I think of\n_Linton_?",
      "I had read _Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton) I m come\nhome: I d lost my way on the moor!",
      "As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child s face looking through the\nwindow.",
      "Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt\nshaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and\nrubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes:\nstill it wailed,  Let me in!",
      "and maintained its tenacious gripe,\nalmost maddening me with fear.",
      "How can I!",
      "I said at length.",
      "Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you\nin!",
      "The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled\nthe books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude\nthe lamentable prayer.",
      "I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the\ninstant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!",
      "Begone!",
      "I shouted.",
      "I ll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty\nyears.",
      "It is twenty years,  mourned the voice:  twenty years.",
      "I ve been a\nwaif for twenty years!",
      "Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile of books moved\nas if thrust forward.",
      "I tried to jump up; but could not stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in\na frenzy of fright.",
      "To my confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps\napproached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous\nhand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.",
      "I sat shuddering, yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead:\nthe intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.",
      "At last, he said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer,\n\n Is any one here?",
      "I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew Heathcliff s\naccents, and feared he might search further, if I kept quiet.",
      "With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.",
      "I shall not soon\nforget the effect my action produced.",
      "Heathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a\ncandle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall\nbehind him.",
      "The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric\nshock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and\nhis agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.",
      "It is only your guest, sir,  I called out, desirous to spare him the\nhumiliation of exposing his cowardice further.",
      "I had the misfortune to\nscream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.",
      "I m sorry I\ndisturbed you.",
      "Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!",
      "I wish you were at the  commenced\nmy host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible\nto hold it steady.",
      "And who showed you up into this room?",
      "he\ncontinued, crushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to\nsubdue the maxillary convulsions.",
      "Who was it?",
      "I ve a good mind to turn\nthem out of the house this moment!",
      "It was your servant Zillah,  I replied, flinging myself on to the\nfloor, and rapidly resuming my garments.",
      "I should not care if you did,\nMr. Heathcliff; she richly deserves it.",
      "I suppose that she wanted to\nget another proof that the place was haunted, at my expense.",
      "Well, it\nis swarming with ghosts and goblins!",
      "You have reason in shutting it up,\nI assure you.",
      "No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!",
      "What do you mean?",
      "asked Heathcliff,  and what are you doing?",
      "Lie down\nand finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for Heaven s sake!",
      "don t repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you\nwere having your throat cut!",
      "If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have\nstrangled me!",
      "I returned.",
      "I m not going to endure the persecutions of\nyour hospitable ancestors again.",
      "Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham\nakin to you on the mother s side?",
      "And that minx, Catherine Linton, or\nEarnshaw, or however she was called she must have been a\nchangeling wicked little soul!",
      "She told me she had been walking the\nearth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal\ntransgressions, I ve no doubt!",
      "Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of\nHeathcliff s with Catherine s name in the book, which had completely\nslipped from my memory, till thus awakened.",
      "I blushed at my\ninconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the\noffence, I hastened to add The truth is, sir, I passed the first part\nof the night in  Here I stopped afresh I was about to say  perusing\nthose old volumes,  then it would have revealed my knowledge of their\nwritten, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I\nwent on in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.",
      "A\nmonotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or \n\n What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me!_  thundered\nHeathcliff with savage vehemence.",
      "How how _dare_ you, under my\nroof?",
      "God!",
      "he s mad to speak so!",
      "And he struck his forehead with rage.",
      "I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my\nexplanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and\nproceeded with my dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation\nof  Catherine Linton  before, but reading it often over produced an\nimpression which personified itself when I had no longer my imagination\nunder control.",
      "Heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the\nbed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed behind it.",
      "I\nguessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted breathing, that he\nstruggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.",
      "Not liking to show\nhim that I had heard the conflict, I continued my toilette rather\nnoisily, looked at my watch, and soliloquised on the length of the\nnight:  Not three o clock yet!",
      "I could have taken oath it had been six.",
      "Time stagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!",
      "Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,  said my host, suppressing\na groan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm s shadow, dashing\na tear from his eyes.",
      "Mr. Lockwood,  he added,  you may go into my\nroom: you ll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early: and your\nchildish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.",
      "And for me, too,  I replied.",
      "I ll walk in the yard till daylight, and\nthen I ll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.",
      "I m now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or\ntown.",
      "A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.",
      "Delightful company!",
      "muttered Heathcliff.",
      "Take the candle, and go\nwhere you please.",
      "I shall join you directly.",
      "Keep out of the yard,\nthough, the dogs are unchained; and the house Juno mounts sentinel\nthere, and nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages.",
      "But,\naway with you!",
      "I ll come in two minutes!",
      "I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the\nnarrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a\npiece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly,\nhis apparent sense.",
      "He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the\nlattice, bursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion\nof tears.",
      "Come in!",
      "come in!",
      "he sobbed.",
      "Cathy, do come.",
      "Oh, do _once_\nmore!",
      "Oh!",
      "my heart s darling!",
      "hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!",
      "The spectre showed a spectre s ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of\nbeing; but the snow and wind whirled wildly through, even reaching my\nstation, and blowing out the light.",
      "There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this\nraving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,\nhalf angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my\nridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was\nbeyond my comprehension.",
      "I descended cautiously to the lower regions,\nand landed in the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly\ntogether, enabled me to rekindle my candle.",
      "Nothing was stirring except\na brindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a\nquerulous mew.",
      "Two benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the\nhearth; on one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the\nother.",
      "We were both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and\nthen it was Joseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the\nroof, through a trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.",
      "He cast a\nsinister look at the little flame which I had enticed to play between\nthe ribs, swept the cat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in\nthe vacancy, commenced the operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with\ntobacco.",
      "My presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of\nimpudence too shameful for remark: he silently applied the tube to his\nlips, folded his arms, and puffed away.",
      "I let him enjoy the luxury\nunannoyed; and after sucking out his last wreath, and heaving a\nprofound sigh, he got up, and departed as solemnly as he came.",
      "A more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a\n good-morning,  but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for\nHareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of\ncurses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a\ncorner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.",
      "He glanced over\nthe back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of\nexchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.",
      "I guessed,\nby his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard\ncouch, made a movement to follow him.",
      "He noticed this, and thrust at an\ninner door with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate\nsound that there was the place where I must go, if I changed my\nlocality.",
      "It opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah\nurging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.\nHeathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the\nblaze.",
      "She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her\neyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to\nchide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,\nnow and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.",
      "I was\nsurprised to see Heathcliff there also.",
      "He stood by the fire, his back\ntowards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever\nand anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron,\nand heave an indignant groan.",
      "And you, you worthless  he broke out as I entered, turning to his\ndaughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or\nsheep, but generally represented by a dash .",
      "There you are, at your\nidle tricks again!",
      "The rest of them do earn their bread you live on my\ncharity!",
      "Put your trash away, and find something to do.",
      "You shall pay\nme for the plague of having you eternally in my sight do you hear,\ndamnable jade?",
      "I ll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,  answered\nthe young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair.",
      "But I ll\nnot do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I\nplease!",
      "Heathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,\nobviously acquainted with its weight.",
      "Having no desire to be\nentertained by a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if\neager to partake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any\nknowledge of the interrupted dispute.",
      "Each had enough decorum to\nsuspend further hostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of\ntemptation, in his pockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked\nto a seat far off, where she kept her word by playing the part of a\nstatue during the remainder of my stay.",
      "That was not long.",
      "I declined\njoining their breakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an\nopportunity of escaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and\ncold as impalpable ice.",
      "My landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the\ngarden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.",
      "It was well he\ndid, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells\nand falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the\nground: many pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges\nof mounds, the refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my\nyesterday s walk left pictured in my mind.",
      "I had remarked on one side\nof the road, at intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright\nstones, continued through the whole length of the barren: these were\nerected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark,\nand also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on\neither hand with the firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing\nup here and there, all traces of their existence had vanished: and my\ncompanion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the\nright or left, when I imagined I was following, correctly, the windings\nof the road.",
      "We exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of\nThrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there.",
      "Our adieux were\nlimited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own\nresources; for the porter s lodge is untenanted as yet.",
      "The distance\nfrom the gate to the Grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make\nit four, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the\nneck in snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it\ncan appreciate.",
      "At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock\nchimed twelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for\nevery mile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.",
      "My human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,\ntumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured\nthat I perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set\nabout the search for my remains.",
      "I bid them be quiet, now that they saw\nme returned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged upstairs;\nwhence, after putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or\nforty minutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study,\nfeeble as a kitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and\nsmoking coffee which the servant had prepared for my refreshment.",
      "CHAPTER IV\n\n\nWhat vain weather-cocks we are!",
      "I, who had determined to hold myself\nindependent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at\nlength, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable I,\nweak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits\nand solitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under\npretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my\nestablishment, I desired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit\ndown while I ate it; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip,\nand either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.",
      "You have lived here a considerable time,  I commenced;  did you not\nsay sixteen years?",
      "Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;\nafter she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.",
      "Indeed.",
      "There ensued a pause.",
      "She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her\nown affairs, and those could hardly interest me.",
      "However, having\nstudied for an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of\nmeditation over her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated Ah, times are\ngreatly changed since then!",
      "Yes,  I remarked,  you ve seen a good many alterations, I suppose?",
      "I have: and troubles too,  she said.",
      "Oh, I ll turn the talk on my landlord s family!",
      "I thought to myself.",
      "A good subject to start!",
      "And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to\nknow her history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is\nmore probable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise\nfor kin.",
      "With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let\nThrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence\nso much inferior.",
      "Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good\norder?",
      "I inquired.",
      "Rich, sir!",
      "she returned.",
      "He has nobody knows what money, and every\nyear it increases.",
      "Yes, yes, he s rich enough to live in a finer house\nthan this: but he s very near close-handed; and, if he had meant to\nflit to Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he\ncould not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.",
      "It is strange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the\nworld!",
      "He had a son, it seems?",
      "Yes, he had one he is dead.",
      "And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?",
      "Yes.",
      "Where did she come from originally?",
      "Why, sir, she is my late master s daughter: Catherine Linton was her\nmaiden name.",
      "I nursed her, poor thing!",
      "I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would\nremove here, and then we might have been together again.",
      "What!",
      "Catherine Linton?",
      "I exclaimed, astonished.",
      "But a minute s\nreflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine.",
      "Then,  I\ncontinued,  my predecessor s name was Linton?",
      "It was.",
      "And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.\nHeathcliff?",
      "Are they relations?",
      "No; he is the late Mrs. Linton s nephew.",
      "The young lady s cousin, then?",
      "Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother s, the\nother on the father s side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton s sister.",
      "I see the house at Wuthering Heights has  Earnshaw  carved over the\nfront door.",
      "Are they an old family?",
      "Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is\nof us I mean, of the Lintons.",
      "Have you been to Wuthering Heights?",
      "I beg\npardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff?",
      "she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I\nthink, not very happy.",
      "Oh dear, I don t wonder!",
      "And how did you like the master?",
      "A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.",
      "Is not that his character?",
      "Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!",
      "The less you meddle with\nhim the better.",
      "He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.",
      "Do you know anything of his history?",
      "It s a cuckoo s, sir I know all about it: except where he was born,\nand who were his parents, and how he got his money at first.",
      "And\nHareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock!",
      "The unfortunate\nlad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has\nbeen cheated.",
      "Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of\nmy neighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good\nenough to sit and chat an hour.",
      "Oh, certainly, sir!",
      "I ll just fetch a little sewing, and then I ll sit\nas long as you please.",
      "But you ve caught cold: I saw you shivering, and\nyou must have some gruel to drive it out.",
      "The worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head\nfelt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to\na pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.",
      "This caused me to\nfeel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious\neffects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday.",
      "She returned\npresently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having\nplaced the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to\nfind me so companionable.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nBefore I came to live here, she commenced waiting no farther invitation\nto her story I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my\nmother had nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton s father, and\nI got used to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped\nto make hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody\nwould set me to.",
      "One fine summer morning it was the beginning of\nharvest, I remember Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came downstairs,\ndressed for a journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be\ndone during the day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me for I sat\neating my porridge with them and he said, speaking to his son,  Now, my\nbonny man, I m going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?",
      "You\nmay choose what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there\nand back: sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!",
      "Hindley named a\nfiddle, and then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but\nshe could ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.",
      "He did\nnot forget me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe\nsometimes.",
      "He promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and\nthen he kissed his children, said good-bye, and set off.",
      "It seemed a long while to us all the three days of his absence and\noften did little Cathy ask when he would be home.",
      "Mrs. Earnshaw\nexpected him by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal\noff hour after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at\nlast the children got tired of running down to the gate to look.",
      "Then\nit grew dark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to\nbe allowed to stay up; and, just about eleven o clock, the door-latch\nwas raised quietly, and in stepped the master.",
      "He threw himself into a\nchair, laughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was\nnearly killed he would not have such another walk for the three\nkingdoms.",
      "And at the end of it to be flighted to death!",
      "he said, opening his\ngreat-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms.",
      "See here, wife!",
      "I\nwas never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e en take it\nas a gift of God; though it s as dark almost as if it came from the\ndevil.",
      "We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy s head I had a peep at a dirty,\nragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed,\nits face looked older than Catherine s; yet when it was set on its\nfeet, it only stared round, and repeated over and over again some\ngibberish that nobody could understand.",
      "I was frightened, and Mrs.\nEarnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how\nhe could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had\ntheir own bairns to feed and fend for?",
      "What he meant to do with it, and\nwhether he were mad?",
      "The master tried to explain the matter; but he was\nreally half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst\nher scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and\nas good as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and\ninquired for its owner.",
      "Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;\nand his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take\nit home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there: because he\nwas determined he would not leave it as he found it.",
      "Well, the\nconclusion was, that my mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr.\nEarnshaw told me to wash it, and give it clean things, and let it sleep\nwith the children.",
      "Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till\npeace was restored: then, both began searching their father s pockets\nfor the presents he had promised them.",
      "The former was a boy of\nfourteen, but when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to\nmorsels in the great-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she\nlearned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger,\nshowed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing;\nearning for her pains a sound blow from her father, to teach her\ncleaner manners.",
      "They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or\neven in their room; and I had no more sense, so I put it on the landing\nof the stairs, hoping it might be gone on the morrow.",
      "By chance, or\nelse attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw s door,\nand there he found it on quitting his chamber.",
      "Inquiries were made as\nto how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my\ncowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.",
      "This was Heathcliff s first introduction to the family.",
      "On coming back\na few days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual),\nI found they had christened him  Heathcliff : it was the name of a son\nwho died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for\nChristian and surname.",
      "Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but\nHindley hated him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued\nand went on with him shamefully: for I wasn t reasonable enough to feel\nmy injustice, and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when\nshe saw him wronged.",
      "He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:\nhe would stand Hindley s blows without winking or shedding a tear, and\nmy pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if\nhe had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.",
      "This\nendurance made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son\npersecuting the poor fatherless child, as he called him.",
      "He took to\nHeathcliff strangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said\nprecious little, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above\nCathy, who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.",
      "So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at\nMrs. Earnshaw s death, which happened in less than two years after, the\nyoung master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather\nthan a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent s affections\nand his privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these\ninjuries.",
      "I sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the\nmeasles, and I had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at\nonce, I changed my idea.",
      "Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he\nlay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose\nhe felt I did a good deal for him, and he hadn t wit to guess that I\nwas compelled to do it.",
      "However, I will say this, he was the quietest\nchild that ever nurse watched over.",
      "The difference between him and the\nothers forced me to be less partial.",
      "Cathy and her brother harassed me\nterribly: _he_ was as uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not\ngentleness, made him give little trouble.",
      "He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing\nto me, and praised me for my care.",
      "I was vain of his commendations, and\nsoftened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus\nHindley lost his last ally: still I couldn t dote on Heathcliff, and I\nwondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy;\nwho never, to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of\ngratitude.",
      "He was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply\ninsensible; though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and\nconscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to\nbend to his wishes.",
      "As an instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought\na couple of colts at the parish fair, and gave the lads each one.",
      "Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it soon fell lame, and when he\ndiscovered it, he said to Hindley \n\n You must exchange horses with me: I don t like mine; and if you won t\nI shall tell your father of the three thrashings you ve given me this\nweek, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.",
      "Hindley put\nout his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.",
      "You d better do it at\nonce,  he persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable):\n you will have to: and if I speak of these blows, you ll get them again\nwith interest.",
      "Off, dog!",
      "cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron\nweight used for weighing potatoes and hay.",
      "Throw it,  he replied,\nstanding still,  and then I ll tell how you boasted that you would turn\nme out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn\nyou out directly.",
      "Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and\ndown he fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and,\nhad not I prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and\ngot full revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who\nhad caused it.",
      "Take my colt, Gipsy, then!",
      "said young Earnshaw.",
      "And I\npray that he may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly\ninterloper!",
      "and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards\nshow him what you are, imp of Satan.",
      "And take that, I hope he ll kick\nout your brains!",
      "Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall;\nhe was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking\nhim under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes\nwere fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.",
      "I was surprised to\nwitness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his\nintention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a\nbundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned,\nbefore he entered the house.",
      "I persuaded him easily to let me lay the\nblame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told\nsince he had what he wanted.",
      "He complained so seldom, indeed, of such\nstirs as these, that I really thought him not vindictive: I was\ndeceived completely, as you will hear.",
      "CHAPTER V\n\n\nIn the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.",
      "He had been active\nand healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was\nconfined to the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable.",
      "A nothing\nvexed him; and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into\nfits.",
      "This was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose\nupon, or domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a\nword should be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head\nthe notion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to\ndo him an ill-turn.",
      "It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder\namong us did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his\npartiality; and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child s\npride and black tempers.",
      "Still it became in a manner necessary; twice,\nor thrice, Hindley s manifestation of scorn, while his father was near,\nroused the old man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and\nshook with rage that he could not do it.",
      "At last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by\nteaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land\nhimself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.\nEarnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said Hindley was\nnought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.",
      "I hoped heartily we should have peace now.",
      "It hurt me to think the\nmaster should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.",
      "I fancied the\ndiscontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as\nhe would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his\nsinking frame.",
      "We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for\ntwo people Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay,\nup yonder.",
      "He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest\nself-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the\npromises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours.",
      "By his\nknack of sermonising and pious discoursing, he contrived to make a\ngreat impression on Mr. Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master\nbecame, the more influence he gained.",
      "He was relentless in worrying him\nabout his soul s concerns, and about ruling his children rigidly.",
      "He\nencouraged him to regard Hindley as a reprobate; and, night after\nnight, he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against\nHeathcliff and Catherine: always minding to flatter Earnshaw s weakness\nby heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.",
      "Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up\nbefore; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener\nin a day: from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to\nbed, we had not a minute s security that she wouldn t be in mischief.",
      "Her spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always\ngoing singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the\nsame.",
      "A wild, wicked slip she was but she had the bonniest eye, the\nsweetest smile, and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I\nbelieve she meant no harm; for when once she made you cry in good\nearnest, it seldom happened that she would not keep you company, and\noblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her.",
      "She was much too\nfond of Heathcliff.",
      "The greatest punishment we could invent for her was\nto keep her separate from him: yet she got chided more than any of us\non his account.",
      "In play, she liked exceedingly to act the little\nmistress; using her hands freely, and commanding her companions: she\ndid so to me, but I would not bear slapping and ordering; and so I let\nher know.",
      "Now, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had\nalways been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had\nno idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing\ncondition than he was in his prime.",
      "His peevish reproofs wakened in her\na naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we\nwere all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy\nlook, and her ready words; turning Joseph s religious curses into\nridicule, baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most showing\nhow her pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over\nHeathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in\nanything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.",
      "After\nbehaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to\nmake it up at night.",
      "Nay, Cathy,  the old man would say,  I cannot\nlove thee, thou rt worse than thy brother.",
      "Go, say thy prayers, child,\nand ask God s pardon.",
      "I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever\nreared thee!",
      "That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed\ncontinually hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was\nsorry for her faults, and beg to be forgiven.",
      "But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw s troubles on\nearth.",
      "He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the\nfire-side.",
      "A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the\nchimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were\nall together I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting,\nand Joseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally\nsat in the house then, after their work was done).",
      "Miss Cathy had been\nsick, and that made her still; she leant against her father s knee, and\nHeathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.",
      "I remember\nthe master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair it\npleased him rarely to see her gentle and saying,  Why canst thou not\nalways be a good lass, Cathy?",
      "And she turned her face up to his, and\nlaughed, and answered,  Why cannot you always be a good man, father?",
      "But as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said\nshe would sing him to sleep.",
      "She began singing very low, till his\nfingers dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.",
      "Then I told\nher to hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.",
      "We all kept as\nmute as mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only\nJoseph, having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse\nthe master for prayers and bed.",
      "He stepped forward, and called him by\nname, and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the\ncandle and looked at him.",
      "I thought there was something wrong as he set\ndown the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them\nto  frame upstairs, and make little din they might pray alone that\nevening he had summut to do.",
      "I shall bid father good-night first,  said Catherine, putting her arms\nround his neck, before we could hinder her.",
      "The poor thing discovered\nher loss directly she screamed out Oh, he s dead, Heathcliff!",
      "he s\ndead!",
      "And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.",
      "I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we\ncould be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.",
      "He\ntold me to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the\nparson.",
      "I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.",
      "However, I went, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor,\nback with me; the other said he would come in the morning.",
      "Leaving\nJoseph to explain matters, I ran to the children s room: their door was\najar, I saw they had never lain down, though it was past midnight; but\nthey were calmer, and did not need me to console them.",
      "The little souls\nwere comforting each other with better thoughts than I could have hit\non: no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they\ndid, in their innocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could\nnot help wishing we were all there safe together.",
      "CHAPTER VI\n\n\nMr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and a thing that amazed us, and\nset the neighbours gossiping right and left he brought a wife with him.",
      "What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably,\nshe had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely\nhave kept the union from his father.",
      "She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own\naccount.",
      "Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,\nappeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about\nher: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the\nmourners.",
      "I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that\nwent on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I\nshould have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and\nclasping her hands, and asking repeatedly Are they gone yet?",
      "Then she\nbegan describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her\nto see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell\na-weeping and when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn t\nknow; but she felt so afraid of dying!",
      "I imagined her as little likely\nto die as myself.",
      "She was rather thin, but young, and\nfresh-complexioned, and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds.",
      "I did\nremark, to be sure, that mounting the stairs made her breathe very\nquick; that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver, and that\nshe coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I knew nothing of what these\nsymptoms portended, and had no impulse to sympathise with her.",
      "We don t\nin general take to foreigners here, Mr. Lockwood, unless they take to\nus first.",
      "Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his\nabsence.",
      "He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and\ndressed quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told\nJoseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the\nback-kitchen, and leave the house for him.",
      "Indeed, he would have\ncarpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour; but his wife\nexpressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace,\nat the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space\nthere was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it\nunnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention.",
      "She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new\nacquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran\nabout with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.",
      "Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,\nHindley became tyrannical.",
      "A few words from her, evincing a dislike to\nHeathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.",
      "He drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the\ninstructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of\ndoors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the\nfarm.",
      "Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy\ntaught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the\nfields.",
      "They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the\nyoung master being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they\ndid, so they kept clear of him.",
      "He would not even have seen after their\ngoing to church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his\ncarelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to\norder Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or\nsupper.",
      "But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the\nmoors in the morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment\ngrew a mere thing to laugh at.",
      "The curate might set as many chapters as\nhe pleased for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash\nHeathcliff till his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they\nwere together again: at least the minute they had contrived some\nnaughty plan of revenge; and many a time I ve cried to myself to watch\nthem growing more reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable,\nfor fear of losing the small power I still retained over the unfriended\ncreatures.",
      "One Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from\nthe sitting-room, for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind;\nand when I went to call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.",
      "We searched the house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they\nwere invisible: and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the\ndoors, and swore nobody should let them in that night.",
      "The household\nwent to bed; and I, too anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put\nmy head out to hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in\nspite of the prohibition, should they return.",
      "In a while, I\ndistinguished steps coming up the road, and the light of a lantern\nglimmered through the gate.",
      "I threw a shawl over my head and ran to\nprevent them from waking Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.",
      "There was\nHeathcliff, by himself: it gave me a start to see him alone.",
      "Where is Miss Catherine?",
      "I cried hurriedly.",
      "No accident, I hope?",
      "At Thrushcross Grange,  he answered;  and I would have been there too,\nbut they had not the manners to ask me to stay.",
      "Well, you will catch\nit!",
      "I said:  you ll never be content till you re sent about your\nbusiness.",
      "What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?",
      "Let me get off my wet clothes, and I ll tell you all about it, Nelly, \nhe replied.",
      "I bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he\nundressed and I waited to put out the candle, he continued Cathy and I\nescaped from the wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a\nglimpse of the Grange lights, we thought we would just go and see\nwhether the Lintons passed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in\ncorners, while their father and mother sat eating and drinking, and\nsinging and laughing, and burning their eyes out before the fire.",
      "Do\nyou think they do?",
      "Or reading sermons, and being catechised by their\nman-servant, and set to learn a column of Scripture names, if they\ndon t answer properly?",
      "Probably not,  I responded.",
      "They are good\nchildren, no doubt, and don t deserve the treatment you receive, for\nyour bad conduct.",
      "Don t cant, Nelly,  he said:  nonsense!",
      "We ran from\nthe top of the Heights to the park, without stopping Catherine\ncompletely beaten in the race, because she was barefoot.",
      "You ll have to\nseek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.",
      "We crept through a broken\nhedge, groped our way up the path, and planted ourselves on a\nflower-plot under the drawing-room window.",
      "The light came from thence;\nthey had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only half\nclosed.",
      "Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement,\nand clinging to the ledge, and we saw ah!",
      "it was beautiful a splendid\nplace carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and\na pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging\nin silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft\ntapers.",
      "Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and his sister\nhad it entirely to themselves.",
      "Shouldn t they have been happy?",
      "We\nshould have thought ourselves in heaven!",
      "And now, guess what your good\nchildren were doing?",
      "Isabella I believe she is eleven, a year younger\nthan Cathy lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as\nif witches were running red-hot needles into her.",
      "Edgar stood on the\nhearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat a little\ndog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual accusations,\nwe understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.",
      "The idiots!",
      "That was their pleasure!",
      "to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm\nhair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get it,\nrefused to take it.",
      "We laughed outright at the petted things; we did\ndespise them!",
      "When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine\nwanted?",
      "or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and\nsobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room?",
      "I d not\nexchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton s\nat Thrushcross Grange not if I might have the privilege of flinging\nJoseph off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with\nHindley s blood!",
      "Hush, hush!",
      "I interrupted.",
      "Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,\nhow Catherine is left behind?",
      "I told you we laughed,  he answered.",
      "The Lintons heard us, and with\none accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and\nthen a cry,  Oh, mamma, mamma!",
      "Oh, papa!",
      "Oh, mamma, come here.",
      "Oh,\npapa, oh!",
      "They really did howl out something in that way.",
      "We made\nfrightful noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off\nthe ledge, because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had\nbetter flee.",
      "I had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all\nat once she fell down.",
      "Run, Heathcliff, run!",
      "she whispered.",
      "They\nhave let the bull-dog loose, and he holds me!",
      "The devil had seized her\nankle, Nelly: I heard his abominable snorting.",
      "She did not yell out no!",
      "she would have scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns\nof a mad cow.",
      "I did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate\nany fiend in Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his\njaws, and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat.",
      "A beast\nof a servant came up with a lantern, at last, shouting Keep fast,\nSkulker, keep fast!",
      "He changed his note, however, when he saw\nSkulker s game.",
      "The dog was throttled off; his huge, purple tongue\nhanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming\nwith bloody slaver.",
      "The man took Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear,\nI m certain, but from pain.",
      "He carried her in; I followed, grumbling\nexecrations and vengeance.",
      "What prey, Robert?",
      "hallooed Linton from\nthe entrance.",
      "Skulker has caught a little girl, sir,  he replied;  and\nthere s a lad here,  he added, making a clutch at me,  who looks an\nout-and-outer!",
      "Very like the robbers were for putting them through the\nwindow to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep, that they\nmight murder us at their ease.",
      "Hold your tongue, you foul-mouthed\nthief, you!",
      "you shall go to the gallows for this.",
      "Mr. Linton, sir,\ndon t lay by your gun.",
      "No, no, Robert,  said the old fool.",
      "The\nrascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they thought to have me\ncleverly.",
      "Come in; I ll furnish them a reception.",
      "There, John, fasten\nthe chain.",
      "Give Skulker some water, Jenny.",
      "To beard a magistrate in his\nstronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!",
      "Where will their insolence stop?",
      "Oh, my dear Mary, look here!",
      "Don t be afraid, it is but a boy yet the\nvillain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not be a kindness to\nthe country to hang him at once, before he shows his nature in acts as\nwell as features?",
      "He pulled me under the chandelier, and Mrs. Linton\nplaced her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror.",
      "The\ncowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella lisping Frightful thing!",
      "Put him in the cellar, papa.",
      "He s exactly like the son of the\nfortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.",
      "Isn t he, Edgar?",
      "While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech,\nand laughed.",
      "Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected\nsufficient wit to recognise her.",
      "They see us at church, you know,\nthough we seldom meet them elsewhere.",
      "That s Miss Earnshaw!",
      "he\nwhispered to his mother,  and look how Skulker has bitten her how her\nfoot bleeds!",
      "Miss Earnshaw?",
      "Nonsense!",
      "cried the dame;  Miss Earnshaw scouring the\ncountry with a gipsy!",
      "And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning surely\nit is and she may be lamed for life!",
      "What culpable carelessness in her brother!",
      "exclaimed Mr. Linton,\nturning from me to Catherine.",
      "I ve understood from Shielders  (that\nwas the curate, sir)  that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.",
      "But who is this?",
      "Where did she pick up this companion?",
      "Oho!",
      "I declare\nhe is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey\nto Liverpool a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.",
      "A wicked boy, at all events,  remarked the old lady,  and quite unfit\nfor a decent house!",
      "Did you notice his language, Linton?",
      "I m shocked\nthat my children should have heard it.",
      "I recommenced cursing don t be angry, Nelly and so Robert was ordered\nto take me off.",
      "I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the\ngarden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw\nshould be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,\nsecured the door again.",
      "The curtains were still looped up at one\ncorner, and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had\nwished to return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a\nmillion of fragments, unless they let her out.",
      "She sat on the sofa\nquietly.",
      "Mrs. Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we\nhad borrowed for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with\nher, I suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction\nbetween her treatment and mine.",
      "Then the woman-servant brought a basin\nof warm water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of\nnegus, and Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar\nstood gaping at a distance.",
      "Afterwards, they dried and combed her\nbeautiful hair, and gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled\nher to the fire; and I left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her\nfood between the little dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he\nate; and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the\nLintons a dim reflection from her own enchanting face.",
      "I saw they were\nfull of stupid admiration; she is so immeasurably superior to them to\neverybody on earth, is she not, Nelly?",
      "There will more come of this business than you reckon on,  I answered,\ncovering him up and extinguishing the light.",
      "You are incurable,\nHeathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if\nhe won t.  My words came truer than I desired.",
      "The luckless adventure\nmade Earnshaw furious.",
      "And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a\nvisit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture\non the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about\nhim, in earnest.",
      "Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that\nthe first word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal;\nand Mrs. Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint\nwhen she returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would\nhave found it impossible.",
      "CHAPTER VII\n\n\nCathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.",
      "By that\ntime her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.",
      "The\nmistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of\nreform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and\nflattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless\nlittle savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all\nbreathless, there lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified\nperson, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered\nbeaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with\nboth hands that she might sail in.",
      "Hindley lifted her from her horse,\nexclaiming delightedly,  Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!",
      "I should\nscarcely have known you: you look like a lady now.",
      "Isabella Linton is\nnot to be compared with her, is she, Frances?",
      "Isabella has not her\nnatural advantages,  replied his wife:  but she must mind and not grow\nwild again here.",
      "Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things Stay,\ndear, you will disarrange your curls let me untie your hat.",
      "I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk\nfrock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes\nsparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she\ndared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid\ngarments.",
      "She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas\ncake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked\nround for Heathcliff.",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their\nmeeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what\ngrounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.",
      "Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.",
      "If he were careless, and\nuncared for, before Catherine s absence, he had been ten times more so\nsince.",
      "Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,\nand bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom\nhave a natural pleasure in soap and water.",
      "Therefore, not to mention\nhis clothes, which had seen three months  service in mire and dust, and\nhis thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally\nbeclouded.",
      "He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a\nbright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed\ncounterpart of himself, as he expected.",
      "Is Heathcliff not here?",
      "she\ndemanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully\nwhitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.",
      "Heathcliff, you may come forward,  cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\ndiscomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard\nhe would be compelled to present himself.",
      "You may come and wish Miss\nCatherine welcome, like the other servants.",
      "Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to\nembrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the\nsecond, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,\nexclaiming,  Why, how very black and cross you look!",
      "and how how funny\nand grim!",
      "But that s because I m used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.",
      "Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?",
      "She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw\ndouble gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.",
      "Shake hands, Heathcliff,  said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly;  once in\na way, that is permitted.",
      "I shall not,  replied the boy, finding his tongue at last;  I shall\nnot stand to be laughed at.",
      "I shall not bear it!",
      "And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him\nagain.",
      "I did not mean to laugh at you,  she said;  I could not hinder myself:\nHeathcliff, shake hands at least!",
      "What are you sulky for?",
      "It was only\nthat you looked odd.",
      "If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will\nbe all right: but you are so dirty!",
      "She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and\nalso at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from\nits contact with his.",
      "You needn t have touched me!",
      "he answered, following her eye and\nsnatching away his hand.",
      "I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like\nto be dirty, and I will be dirty.",
      "With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of\nthe master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine;\nwho could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an\nexhibition of bad temper.",
      "After playing lady s-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the\noven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,\nbefitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by\nsinging carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph s affirmations that he\nconsidered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.",
      "He had\nretired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw\nwere engaging Missy s attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to\npresent to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.",
      "They had invited them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the\ninvitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that\nher darlings might be kept carefully apart from that  naughty swearing\nboy.",
      "Under these circumstances I remained solitary.",
      "I smelt the rich scent\nof the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the\npolished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready\nto be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless\npurity of my particular care the scoured and well-swept floor.",
      "I gave\ndue inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old\nEarnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,\nand slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I\nwent on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he\nshould suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally\nled me to consider the poor lad s situation now, and from singing I\nchanged my mind to crying.",
      "It struck me soon, however, there would be\nmore sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding\ntears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him.",
      "He was\nnot far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the\nstable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom.",
      "Make haste, Heathcliff!",
      "I said,  the kitchen is so comfortable; and\nJoseph is upstairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss\nCathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth\nto yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.",
      "He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.",
      "Come are you coming?",
      "I continued.",
      "There s a little cake for each of\nyou, nearly enough; and you ll need half-an-hour s donning.",
      "I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.",
      "Catherine supped\nwith her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an\nunsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on\nthe other.",
      "His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the\nfairies.",
      "He managed to continue work till nine o clock, and then\nmarched dumb and dour to his chamber.",
      "Cathy sat up late, having a world\nof things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into\nthe kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only\nstayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back.",
      "In the\nmorning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour\non to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for\nchurch.",
      "Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better\nspirit.",
      "He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his\ncourage, exclaimed abruptly Nelly, make me decent, I m going to be\ngood.",
      "High time, Heathcliff,  I said;  you _have_ grieved Catherine: she s\nsorry she ever came home, I daresay!",
      "It looks as if you envied her,\nbecause she is more thought of than you.",
      "The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the\nnotion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.",
      "Did she say she was grieved?",
      "he inquired, looking very serious.",
      "She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.",
      "Well, _I_ cried last night,  he returned,  and I had more reason to\ncry than she.",
      "Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an\nempty stomach,  said I.",
      "Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.",
      "But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind,\nwhen she comes in.",
      "You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say you\nknow best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought\nher converted into a stranger by her grand dress.",
      "And now, though I\nhave dinner to get ready, I ll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar\nLinton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does.",
      "You are\nyounger, and yet, I ll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad\nacross the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don t\nyou feel that you could?",
      "Heathcliff s face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and\nhe sighed.",
      "But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn t make him\nless handsome or me more so.",
      "I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,\nand was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich\nas he will be!",
      "And cried for mamma at every turn,  I added,  and trembled if a\ncountry lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a\nshower of rain.",
      "Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!",
      "Come to\nthe glass, and I ll let you see what you should wish.",
      "Do you mark those\ntwo lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of\nrising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so\ndeeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting\nunder them, like devil s spies?",
      "Wish and learn to smooth away the surly\nwrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to\nconfident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always\nseeing friends where they are not sure of foes.",
      "Don t get the\nexpression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are\nits desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for\nwhat it suffers.",
      "In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton s great blue eyes and\neven forehead,  he replied.",
      "I do and that won t help me to them.",
      "A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,  I continued,  if\nyou were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into\nsomething worse than ugly.",
      "And now that we ve done washing, and\ncombing, and sulking tell me whether you don t think yourself rather\nhandsome?",
      "I ll tell you, I do.",
      "You re fit for a prince in disguise.",
      "Who\nknows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian\nqueen, each of them able to buy up, with one week s income, Wuthering\nHeights and Thrushcross Grange together?",
      "And you were kidnapped by\nwicked sailors and brought to England.",
      "Were I in your place, I would\nframe high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should\ngive me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little\nfarmer!",
      "So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to\nlook quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted\nby a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.",
      "He ran\nto the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons\ndescend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the\nEarnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in\nwinter.",
      "Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them\ninto the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour\ninto their white faces.",
      "I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he\nwillingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the\ndoor leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the\nother.",
      "They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and\ncheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved\nhim back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph  keep the fellow\nout of the room send him into the garret till dinner is over.",
      "He ll be\ncramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone\nwith them a minute.",
      "Nay, sir,  I could not avoid answering,  he ll touch nothing, not he:\nand I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.",
      "He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till\ndark,  cried Hindley.",
      "Begone, you vagabond!",
      "What!",
      "you are attempting\nthe coxcomb, are you?",
      "Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks see\nif I won t pull them a bit longer!",
      "They are long enough already,  observed Master Linton, peeping from\nthe doorway;  I wonder they don t make his head ache.",
      "It s like a\ncolt s mane over his eyes!",
      "He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but\nHeathcliff s violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance\nof impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.",
      "He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce, the first thing that came under\nhis gripe, and dashed it full against the speaker s face and neck; who\ninstantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine\nhurrying to the place.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly\nand conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a\nrough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and\nbreathless.",
      "I got the dish-cloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed\nEdgar s nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling.",
      "His\nsister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded,\nblushing for all.",
      "You should not have spoken to him!",
      "she expostulated with Master\nLinton.",
      "He was in a bad temper, and now you ve spoilt your visit; and\nhe ll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged!",
      "I can t eat my dinner.",
      "Why\ndid you speak to him, Edgar?",
      "I didn t,  sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the\nremainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.",
      "I\npromised mamma that I wouldn t say one word to him, and I didn t. \n\n Well, don t cry,  replied Catherine, contemptuously;  you re not\nkilled.",
      "Don t make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!",
      "Hush,\nIsabella!",
      "Has anybody hurt _you?_ \n\n There, there, children to your seats!",
      "cried Hindley, bustling in.",
      "That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.",
      "Next time, Master Edgar,\ntake the law into your own fists it will give you an appetite!",
      "The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant\nfeast.",
      "They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no\nreal harm had befallen them.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls,\nand the mistress made them merry with lively talk.",
      "I waited behind her\nchair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an\nindifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.",
      "An unfeeling child,  I thought to myself;  how lightly she dismisses\nher old playmate s troubles.",
      "I could not have imagined her to be so\nselfish.",
      "She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down\nagain: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them.",
      "She slipped\nher fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her\nemotion.",
      "I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in\npurgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of\ngetting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been\nlocked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce\nto him a private mess of victuals.",
      "In the evening we had a dance.",
      "Cathy begged that he might be liberated\nthen, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and\nI was appointed to supply the deficiency.",
      "We got rid of all gloom in\nthe excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the\narrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a\ntrombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides\nsingers.",
      "They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive\ncontributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to\nhear them.",
      "After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs\nand glees.",
      "Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.",
      "Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of\nthe steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed.",
      "They shut the house\ndoor below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people.",
      "She\nmade no stay at the stairs -head, but mounted farther, to the garret\nwhere Heathcliff was confined, and called him.",
      "He stubbornly declined\nanswering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to\nhold communion with her through the boards.",
      "I let the poor things\nconverse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and\nthe singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to\nwarn her.",
      "Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within.",
      "The\nlittle monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,\ninto the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I\ncould coax her out again.",
      "When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,\nand she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my\nfellow-servant had gone to a neighbour s, to be removed from the sound\nof our  devil s psalmody,  as it pleased him to call it.",
      "I told them I\nintended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had\nnever broken his fast since yesterday s dinner, I would wink at his\ncheating Mr. Hindley that once.",
      "He went down: I set him a stool by the\nfire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and\ncould eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away.",
      "He\nleant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands, and\nremained rapt in dumb meditation.",
      "On my inquiring the subject of his\nthoughts, he answered gravely I m trying to settle how I shall pay\nHindley back.",
      "I don t care how long I wait, if I can only do it at\nlast.",
      "I hope he will not die before I do!",
      "For shame, Heathcliff!",
      "said I.",
      "It is for God to punish wicked\npeople; we should learn to forgive.",
      "No, God won t have the satisfaction that I shall,  he returned.",
      "I\nonly wish I knew the best way!",
      "Let me alone, and I ll plan it out:\nwhile I m thinking of that I don t feel pain.",
      "But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.",
      "I m annoyed\nhow I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel\ncold, and you nodding for bed!",
      "I could have told Heathcliff s history,\nall that you need hear, in half a dozen words.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nThus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay\naside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I\nwas very far from nodding.",
      "Sit still, Mrs. Dean,  I cried;  do sit\nstill another half-hour.",
      "You ve done just right to tell the story\nleisurely.",
      "That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the\nsame style.",
      "I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more\nor less.",
      "The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.",
      "No matter I m not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.",
      "One or\ntwo is early enough for a person who lies till ten.",
      "You shouldn t lie till ten.",
      "There s the very prime of the morning gone\nlong before that time.",
      "A person who has not done one-half his day s\nwork by ten o clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.",
      "Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend\nlengthening the night till afternoon.",
      "I prognosticate for myself an\nobstinate cold, at least.",
      "I hope not, sir.",
      "Well, you must allow me to leap over some three\nyears; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw \n\n No, no, I ll allow nothing of the sort!",
      "Are you acquainted with the\nmood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking\nits kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so\nintently that puss s neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of\ntemper?",
      "A terribly lazy mood, I should say.",
      "On the contrary, a tiresomely active one.",
      "It is mine, at present; and,\ntherefore, continue minutely.",
      "I perceive that people in these regions\nacquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does\nover a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the\ndeepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the\nlooker-on.",
      "They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less\nin surface, change, and frivolous external things.",
      "I could fancy a love\nfor life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love\nof a year s standing.",
      "One state resembles setting a hungry man down to\na single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do\nit justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French\ncooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but\neach part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.",
      "Oh!",
      "here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us, \nobserved Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.",
      "Excuse me,  I responded;  you, my good friend, are a striking evidence\nagainst that assertion.",
      "Excepting a few provincialisms of slight\nconsequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to\nconsider as peculiar to your class.",
      "I am sure you have thought a great\ndeal more than the generality of servants think.",
      "You have been\ncompelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions\nfor frittering your life away in silly trifles.",
      "Mrs. Dean laughed.",
      "I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,  she\nsaid;  not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of\nfaces, and one series of actions, from year s end to year s end; but I\nhave undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then,\nI have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.",
      "You could not open\na book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something\nout of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of\nFrench; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can\nexpect of a poor man s daughter.",
      "However, if I am to follow my story in\ntrue gossip s fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three\nyears, I will be content to pass to the next summer the summer of 1778,\nthat is nearly twenty-three years ago.",
      "CHAPTER VIII\n\n\nOn the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and\nthe last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.",
      "We were busy with the\nhay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our\nbreakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the\nlane, calling me as she ran.",
      "Oh, such a grand bairn!",
      "she panted out.",
      "The finest lad that ever\nbreathed!",
      "But the doctor says missis must go: he says she s been in a\nconsumption these many months.",
      "I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now\nshe has nothing to keep her, and she ll be dead before winter.",
      "You must\ncome home directly.",
      "You re to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar\nand milk, and take care of it day and night.",
      "I wish I were you, because\nit will be all yours when there is no missis!",
      "But is she very ill?",
      "I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my\nbonnet.",
      "I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,  replied the girl,  and she\ntalks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man.",
      "She s out of\nher head for joy, it s such a beauty!",
      "If I were her I m certain I\nshould not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite\nof Kenneth.",
      "I was fairly mad at him.",
      "Dame Archer brought the cherub\ndown to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when\nthe old croaker steps forward, and says he Earnshaw, it s a blessing\nyour wife has been spared to leave you this son.",
      "When she came, I felt\nconvinced we shouldn t keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the\nwinter will probably finish her.",
      "Don t take on, and fret about it too\nmuch: it can t be helped.",
      "And besides, you should have known better\nthan to choose such a rush of a lass!",
      "And what did the master answer?",
      "I inquired.",
      "I think he swore: but I didn t mind him, I was straining to see the\nbairn,  and she began again to describe it rapturously.",
      "I, as zealous\nas herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was\nvery sad for Hindley s sake.",
      "He had room in his heart only for two\nidols his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I\ncouldn t conceive how he would bear the loss.",
      "When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door;\nand, as I passed in, I asked,  how was the baby?",
      "Nearly ready to run about, Nell!",
      "he replied, putting on a cheerful\nsmile.",
      "And the mistress?",
      "I ventured to inquire;  the doctor says she s \n\n Damn the doctor!",
      "he interrupted, reddening.",
      "Frances is quite right:\nshe ll be perfectly well by this time next week.",
      "Are you going\nupstairs?",
      "will you tell her that I ll come, if she ll promise not to\ntalk.",
      "I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she\nmust tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.",
      "I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty\nspirits, and replied merrily,  I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there\nhe has gone out twice, crying.",
      "Well, say I promise I won t speak: but\nthat does not bind me not to laugh at him!",
      "Poor soul!",
      "Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed\nher; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming\nher health improved every day.",
      "When Kenneth warned him that his\nmedicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn t put\nhim to further expense by attending her, he retorted,  I know you need\nnot she s well she does not want any more attendance from you!",
      "She\nnever was in a consumption.",
      "It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse\nis as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.",
      "He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one\nnight, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought\nshe should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her a\nvery slight one he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about\nhis neck, her face changed, and she was dead.",
      "As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my\nhands.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him\ncry, was contented, as far as regarded him.",
      "For himself, he grew\ndesperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.",
      "He neither\nwept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave\nhimself up to reckless dissipation.",
      "The servants could not bear his\ntyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that\nwould stay.",
      "I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you\nknow, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more\nreadily than a stranger would.",
      "Joseph remained to hector over tenants\nand labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had\nplenty of wickedness to reprove.",
      "The master s bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for\nCatherine and Heathcliff.",
      "His treatment of the latter was enough to\nmake a fiend of a saint.",
      "And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_\npossessed of something diabolical at that period.",
      "He delighted to\nwitness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily\nmore notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.",
      "I could not half tell\nwhat an infernal house we had.",
      "The curate dropped calling, and nobody\ndecent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton s visits to Miss\nCathy might be an exception.",
      "At fifteen she was the queen of the\ncountry-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty,\nheadstrong creature!",
      "I own I did not like her, after infancy was past;\nand I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she\nnever took an aversion to me, though.",
      "She had a wondrous constancy to\nold attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections\nunalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it\ndifficult to make an equally deep impression.",
      "He was my late master:\nthat is his portrait over the fireplace.",
      "It used to hang on one side,\nand his wife s on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you\nmight see something of what she was.",
      "Can you make that out?",
      "Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,\nexceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive\nand amiable in expression.",
      "It formed a sweet picture.",
      "The long light\nhair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious;\nthe figure almost too graceful.",
      "I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw\ncould forget her first friend for such an individual.",
      "I marvelled much\nhow he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea\nof Catherine Earnshaw.",
      "A very agreeable portrait,  I observed to the house-keeper.",
      "Is it\nlike?",
      "Yes,  she answered;  but he looked better when he was animated; that\nis his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.",
      "Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her\nfive-weeks  residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show\nher rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of\nbeing rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed\nunwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;\ngained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her\nbrother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was\nfull of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without\nexactly intending to deceive any one.",
      "In the place where she heard\nHeathcliff termed a  vulgar young ruffian,  and  worse than a brute, \nshe took care not to act like him; but at home she had small\ninclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and\nrestrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor\npraise.",
      "Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.",
      "He\nhad a terror of Earnshaw s reputation, and shrunk from encountering\nhim; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility:\nthe master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if\nhe could not be gracious, kept out of the way.",
      "I rather think his\nappearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful,\nnever played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two\nfriends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of\nLinton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his\nabsence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff,\nshe dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if\ndepreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.",
      "I ve had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which\nshe vainly strove to hide from my mockery.",
      "That sounds ill-natured: but\nshe was so proud, it became really impossible to pity her distresses,\ntill she should be chastened into more humility.",
      "She did bring herself,\nfinally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else\nthat she might fashion into an adviser.",
      "Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed\nto give himself a holiday on the strength of it.",
      "He had reached the age\nof sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being\ndeficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward\nand outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.",
      "In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early\neducation: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had\nextinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge,\nand any love for books or learning.",
      "His childhood s sense of\nsuperiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was\nfaded away.",
      "He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in\nher studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he\nyielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step\nin the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink\nbeneath his former level.",
      "Then personal appearance sympathised with\nmental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look;\nhis naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost\nidiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure,\napparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few\nacquaintance.",
      "Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of\nrespite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her\nin words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses,\nas if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks\nof affection on him.",
      "On the before-named occasion he came into the\nhouse to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting\nMiss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it\ninto his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place\nto herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her\nbrother s absence, and was then preparing to receive him.",
      "Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?",
      "asked Heathcliff.",
      "Are you going\nanywhere?",
      "No, it is raining,  she answered.",
      "Why have you that silk frock on, then?",
      "he said.",
      "Nobody coming here,\nI hope?",
      "Not that I know of,  stammered Miss:  but you should be in the field\nnow, Heathcliff.",
      "It is an hour past dinner time; I thought you were\ngone.",
      "Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,  observed\nthe boy.",
      "I ll not work any more to-day: I ll stay with you.",
      "Oh, but Joseph will tell,  she suggested;  you d better go!",
      "Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will\ntake him till dark, and he ll never know.",
      "So saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.",
      "Catherine reflected\nan instant, with knitted brows she found it needful to smooth the way\nfor an intrusion.",
      "Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this\nafternoon,  she said, at the conclusion of a minute s silence.",
      "As it\nrains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run\nthe risk of being scolded for no good.",
      "Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,  he persisted;  don t turn\nme out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!",
      "I m on the point,\nsometimes, of complaining that they but I ll not \n\n That they what?",
      "cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled\ncountenance.",
      "Oh, Nelly!",
      "she added petulantly, jerking her head away\nfrom my hands,  you ve combed my hair quite out of curl!",
      "That s enough;\nlet me alone.",
      "What are you on the point of complaining about,\nHeathcliff?",
      "Nothing only look at the almanack on that wall;  he pointed to a\nframed sheet hanging near the window, and continued,  The crosses are\nfor the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those\nspent with me.",
      "Do you see?",
      "I ve marked every day.",
      "Yes very foolish: as if I took notice!",
      "replied Catherine, in a\npeevish tone.",
      "And where is the sense of that?",
      "To show that I _do_ take notice,  said Heathcliff.",
      "And should I always be sitting with you?",
      "she demanded, growing more\nirritated.",
      "What good do I get?",
      "What do you talk about?",
      "You might be\ndumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you\ndo, either!",
      "You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you\ndisliked my company, Cathy!",
      "exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.",
      "It s no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,  she\nmuttered.",
      "Her companion rose up, but he hadn t time to express his feelings\nfurther, for a horse s feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked\ngently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the\nunexpected summons he had received.",
      "Doubtless Catherine marked the\ndifference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.",
      "The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal\ncountry for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were\nas opposite as his aspect.",
      "He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and\npronounced his words as you do: that s less gruff than we talk here,\nand softer.",
      "I m not come too soon, am I?",
      "he said, casting a look at me: I had\nbegun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the\ndresser.",
      "No,  answered Catherine.",
      "What are you doing there, Nelly?",
      "My work, Miss,  I replied.",
      "(Mr. Hindley had given me directions to\nmake a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)",
      "She stepped behind me and whispered crossly,  Take yourself and your\ndusters off; when company are in the house, servants don t commence\nscouring and cleaning in the room where they are!",
      "It s a good opportunity, now that master is away,  I answered aloud:\n he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.",
      "I m\nsure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.",
      "I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,  exclaimed the young lady\nimperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to\nrecover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.",
      "I m sorry for it, Miss Catherine,  was my response; and I proceeded\nassiduously with my occupation.",
      "She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my\nhand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the\narm.",
      "I ve said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her\nvanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up\nfrom my knees, and screamed out,  Oh, Miss, that s a nasty trick!",
      "You\nhave no right to nip me, and I m not going to bear it.",
      "I didn t touch you, you lying creature!",
      "cried she, her fingers\ntingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.",
      "She never had\npower to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a\nblaze.",
      "What s that, then?",
      "I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to\nrefute her.",
      "She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled\nby the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging\nblow that filled both eyes with water.",
      "Catherine, love!",
      "Catherine!",
      "interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the\ndouble fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.",
      "Leave the room, Ellen!",
      "she repeated, trembling all over.",
      "Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on\nthe floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out\ncomplaints against  wicked aunt Cathy,  which drew her fury on to his\nunlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor\nchild waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to\ndeliver him.",
      "In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young\nman felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be\nmistaken for jest.",
      "He drew back in consternation.",
      "I lifted Hareton in\nmy arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of\ncommunication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle\ntheir disagreement.",
      "The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had\nlaid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip.",
      "That s right!",
      "I said to myself.",
      "Take warning and begone!",
      "It s a\nkindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.",
      "Where are you going?",
      "demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.",
      "He swerved aside, and attempted to pass.",
      "You must not go!",
      "she exclaimed, energetically.",
      "I must and shall!",
      "he replied in a subdued voice.",
      "No,  she persisted, grasping the handle;  not yet, Edgar Linton: sit\ndown; you shall not leave me in that temper.",
      "I should be miserable all\nnight, and I won t be miserable for you!",
      "Can I stay after you have struck me?",
      "asked Linton.",
      "Catherine was mute.",
      "You ve made me afraid and ashamed of you,  he continued;  I ll not\ncome here again!",
      "Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.",
      "And you told a deliberate untruth!",
      "he said.",
      "I didn t!",
      "she cried, recovering her speech;  I did nothing\ndeliberately.",
      "Well, go, if you please get away!",
      "And now I ll cry I ll\ncry myself sick!",
      "She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious\nearnest.",
      "Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there\nhe lingered.",
      "I resolved to encourage him.",
      "Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,  I called out.",
      "As bad as any marred\nchild: you d better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to\ngrieve us.",
      "The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the\npower to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse\nhalf killed, or a bird half eaten.",
      "Ah, I thought, there will be no\nsaving him: he s doomed, and flies to his fate!",
      "And so it was: he\nturned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind\nhim; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had\ncome home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears\n(his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had\nmerely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful\ntimidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and\nconfess themselves lovers.",
      "Intelligence of Mr. Hindley s arrival drove Linton speedily to his\nhorse, and Catherine to her chamber.",
      "I went to hide little Hareton, and\nto take the shot out of the master s fowling-piece, which he was fond\nof playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of\nany who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit\nupon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did\ngo the length of firing the gun.",
      "CHAPTER IX\n\n\nHe entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the\nact of stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.",
      "Hareton was\nimpressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild\nbeast s fondness or his madman s rage; for in one he ran a chance of\nbeing squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung\ninto the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained\nperfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him.",
      "There, I ve found it out at last!",
      "cried Hindley, pulling me back by\nthe skin of my neck, like a dog.",
      "By heaven and hell, you ve sworn\nbetween you to murder that child!",
      "I know how it is, now, that he is\nalways out of my way.",
      "But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you\nswallow the carving-knife, Nelly!",
      "You needn t laugh; for I ve just\ncrammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is\nthe same as one and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest\ntill I do!",
      "But I don t like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,  I answered;  it has\nbeen cutting red herrings.",
      "I d rather be shot, if you please.",
      "You d rather be damned!",
      "he said;  and so you shall.",
      "No law in England\ncan hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine s abominable!",
      "Open your mouth.",
      "He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth:\nbut, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries.",
      "I spat out,\nand affirmed it tasted detestably I would not take it on any account.",
      "Oh!",
      "said he, releasing me,  I see that hideous little villain is not\nHareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.",
      "If it be, he deserves flaying alive\nfor not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.",
      "Unnatural cub, come hither!",
      "I ll teach thee to impose on a\ngood-hearted, deluded father.",
      "Now, don t you think the lad would be\nhandsomer cropped?",
      "It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something\nfierce get me a scissors something fierce and trim!",
      "Besides, it s\ninfernal affectation devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears we re\nasses enough without them.",
      "Hush, child, hush!",
      "Well then, it is my\ndarling!",
      "wisht, dry thy eyes there s a joy; kiss me.",
      "What!",
      "it won t?",
      "Kiss me, Hareton!",
      "Damn thee, kiss me!",
      "By God, as if I would rear such a\nmonster!",
      "As sure as I m living, I ll break the brat s neck.",
      "Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father s arms with all\nhis might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him upstairs and\nlifted him over the banister.",
      "I cried out that he would frighten the\nchild into fits, and ran to rescue him.",
      "As I reached them, Hindley\nleant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost\nforgetting what he had in his hands.",
      "Who is that?",
      "he asked, hearing\nsome one approaching the stairs -foot.",
      "I leant forward also, for the\npurpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come\nfurther; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a\nsudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him,\nand fell.",
      "There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw\nthat the little wretch was safe.",
      "Heathcliff arrived underneath just at\nthe critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and\nsetting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the\naccident.",
      "A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five\nshillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand\npounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding\nthe figure of Mr. Earnshaw above.",
      "It expressed, plainer than words\ncould do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument\nof thwarting his own revenge.",
      "Had it been dark, I daresay he would have\ntried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton s skull on the steps;\nbut, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my\nprecious charge pressed to my heart.",
      "Hindley descended more leisurely,\nsobered and abashed.",
      "It is your fault, Ellen,  he said;  you should have kept him out of\nsight: you should have taken him from me!",
      "Is he injured anywhere?",
      "Injured!",
      "I cried angrily;  if he is not killed, he ll be an idiot!",
      "Oh!",
      "I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use\nhim.",
      "You re worse than a heathen treating your own flesh and blood in\nthat manner!",
      "He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me,\nsobbed off his terror directly.",
      "At the first finger his father laid on\nhim, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if\nhe would go into convulsions.",
      "You shall not meddle with him!",
      "I continued.",
      "He hates you they all\nhate you that s the truth!",
      "A happy family you have; and a pretty state\nyou re come to!",
      "I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,  laughed the misguided man,\nrecovering his hardness.",
      "At present, convey yourself and him away.",
      "And\nhark you, Heathcliff!",
      "clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.",
      "I\nwouldn t murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:\nbut that s as my fancy goes.",
      "While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and\npoured some into a tumbler.",
      "Nay, don t!",
      "I entreated.",
      "Mr. Hindley, do take warning.",
      "Have mercy on\nthis unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!",
      "Any one will do better for him than I shall,  he answered.",
      "Have mercy on your own soul!",
      "I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass\nfrom his hand.",
      "Not I!",
      "On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to\nperdition to punish its Maker,  exclaimed the blasphemer.",
      "Here s to\nits hearty damnation!",
      "He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his\ncommand with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or\nremember.",
      "It s a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,  observed Heathcliff,\nmuttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.",
      "He s doing\nhis very utmost; but his constitution defies him.",
      "Mr. Kenneth says he\nwould wager his mare that he ll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton,\nand go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the\ncommon course befall him.",
      "I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.",
      "Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.",
      "It turned out\nafterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when\nhe flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire, and\nremained silent.",
      "I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began, \n\nIt was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,\nThe mither beneath the mools heard that,\n\n\nwhen Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her\nhead in, and whispered, Are you alone, Nelly?",
      "Yes, Miss,  I replied.",
      "She entered and approached the hearth.",
      "I, supposing she was going to\nsay something, looked up.",
      "The expression of her face seemed disturbed\nand anxious.",
      "Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and\nshe drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.",
      "I\nresumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.",
      "Where s Heathcliff?",
      "she said, interrupting me.",
      "About his work in the stable,  was my answer.",
      "He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze.",
      "There\nfollowed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two\ntrickle from Catherine s cheek to the flags.",
      "Is she sorry for her\nshameful conduct?",
      "I asked myself.",
      "That will be a novelty: but she may\ncome to the point as she will I sha n t help her!",
      "No, she felt small\ntrouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "she cried at last.",
      "I m very unhappy!",
      "A pity,  observed I.",
      "You re hard to please; so many friends and so\nfew cares, and can t make yourself content!",
      "Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?",
      "she pursued, kneeling down by\nme, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look\nwhich turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the\nworld to indulge it.",
      "Is it worth keeping?",
      "I inquired, less sulkily.",
      "Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!",
      "I want to know what I\nshould do.",
      "To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I ve\ngiven him an answer.",
      "Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or\ndenial, you tell me which it ought to have been.",
      "Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?",
      "I replied.",
      "To be sure,\nconsidering the exhibition you performed in his presence this\nafternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked\nyou after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome\nfool.",
      "If you talk so, I won t tell you any more,  she returned, peevishly\nrising to her feet.",
      "I accepted him, Nelly.",
      "Be quick, and say whether I\nwas wrong!",
      "You accepted him!",
      "Then what good is it discussing the matter?",
      "You have\npledged your word, and cannot retract.",
      "But say whether I should have done so do!",
      "she exclaimed in an\nirritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.",
      "There are many things to be considered before that question can be\nanswered properly,  I said, sententiously.",
      "First and foremost, do you\nlove Mr. Edgar?",
      "Who can help it?",
      "Of course I do,  she answered.",
      "Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of\ntwenty-two it was not injudicious.",
      "Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?",
      "Nonsense, I do that s sufficient.",
      "By no means; you must say why?",
      "Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.",
      "Bad!",
      "was my commentary.",
      "And because he is young and cheerful.",
      "Bad, still.",
      "And because he loves me.",
      "Indifferent, coming there.",
      "And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the\nneighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.",
      "Worst of all.",
      "And now, say how you love him?",
      "As everybody loves You re silly, Nelly.",
      "Not at all Answer.",
      "I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and\neverything he touches, and every word he says.",
      "I love all his looks,\nand all his actions, and him entirely and altogether.",
      "There now!",
      "And why?",
      "Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured!",
      "It s\nno jest to me!",
      "said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to\nthe fire.",
      "I m very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,  I replied.",
      "You love Mr.\nEdgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and\nloves you.",
      "The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him\nwithout that, probably; and with it you wouldn t, unless he possessed\nthe four former attractions.",
      "No, to be sure not: I should only pity him hate him, perhaps, if he\nwere ugly, and a clown.",
      "But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:\nhandsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.",
      "What should hinder you from\nloving them?",
      "If there be any, they are out of my way: I ve seen none like Edgar.",
      "You may see some; and he won t always be handsome, and young, and may\nnot always be rich.",
      "He is now; and I have only to do with the present.",
      "I wish you would\nspeak rationally.",
      "Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry\nMr. Linton.",
      "I don t want your permission for that I _shall_ marry him: and yet you\nhave not told me whether I m right.",
      "Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.",
      "And\nnow, let us hear what you are unhappy about.",
      "Your brother will be\npleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will\nescape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable\none; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.",
      "All seems smooth and\neasy: where is the obstacle?",
      "_Here_!",
      "and _here_!",
      "replied Catherine, striking one hand on her\nforehead, and the other on her breast:  in whichever place the soul\nlives.",
      "In my soul and in my heart, I m convinced I m wrong!",
      "That s very strange!",
      "I cannot make it out.",
      "It s my secret.",
      "But if you will not mock at me, I ll explain it: I\ncan t do it distinctly; but I ll give you a feeling of how I feel.",
      "She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,\nand her clasped hands trembled.",
      "Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?",
      "she said, suddenly, after\nsome minutes  reflection.",
      "Yes, now and then,  I answered.",
      "And so do I. I ve dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\never after, and changed my ideas: they ve gone through and through me,\nlike wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.",
      "And this is\none: I m going to tell it but take care not to smile at any part of\nit.",
      "Oh!",
      "don t, Miss Catherine!",
      "I cried.",
      "We re dismal enough without\nconjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.",
      "Come, come, be merry and\nlike yourself!",
      "Look at little Hareton!",
      "_he s_ dreaming nothing dreary.",
      "How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!",
      "Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude!",
      "You remember\nhim, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:\nnearly as young and innocent.",
      "However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to\nlisten: it s not long; and I ve no power to be merry to-night.",
      "I won t hear it, I won t hear it!",
      "I repeated, hastily.",
      "I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had\nan unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which\nI might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.",
      "She was\nvexed, but she did not proceed.",
      "Apparently taking up another subject,\nshe recommenced in a short time.",
      "If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.",
      "Because you are not fit to go there,  I answered.",
      "All sinners would\nbe miserable in heaven.",
      "But it is not for that.",
      "I dreamt once that I was there.",
      "I tell you I won t hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine!",
      "I ll go to\nbed,  I interrupted again.",
      "She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.",
      "This is nothing,  cried she:  I was only going to say that heaven did\nnot seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back\nto earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\nmiddle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke\nsobbing for joy.",
      "That will do to explain my secret, as well as the\nother.",
      "I ve no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in\nheaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so\nlow, I shouldn t have thought of it.",
      "It would degrade me to marry\nHeathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not\nbecause he s handsome, Nelly, but because he s more myself than I am.",
      "Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton s\nis as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.",
      "Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff s presence.",
      "Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise\nfrom the bench, and steal out noiselessly.",
      "He had listened till he\nheard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he\nstayed to hear no further.",
      "My companion, sitting on the ground, was\nprevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or\ndeparture; but I started, and bade her hush!",
      "Why?",
      "she asked, gazing nervously round.",
      "Joseph is here,  I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\ncartwheels up the road;  and Heathcliff will come in with him.",
      "I m not\nsure whether he were not at the door this moment.",
      "Oh, he couldn t overhear me at the door!",
      "said she.",
      "Give me Hareton,\nwhile you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.",
      "I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that\nHeathcliff has no notion of these things.",
      "He has not, has he?",
      "He does\nnot know what being in love is!",
      "I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,  I returned;\n and if _you_ are his choice, he ll be the most unfortunate creature\nthat ever was born!",
      "As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend,\nand love, and all!",
      "Have you considered how you ll bear the separation,\nand how he ll bear to be quite deserted in the world?",
      "Because, Miss\nCatherine \n\n He quite deserted!",
      "we separated!",
      "she exclaimed, with an accent of\nindignation.",
      "Who is to separate us, pray?",
      "They ll meet the fate of\nMilo!",
      "Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.",
      "Every\nLinton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could\nconsent to forsake Heathcliff.",
      "Oh, that s not what I intend that s not\nwhat I mean!",
      "I shouldn t be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!",
      "He ll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.",
      "Edgar must\nshake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least.",
      "He will, when he\nlearns my true feelings towards him.",
      "Nelly, I see now you think me a\nselfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I\nmarried, we should be beggars?",
      "whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid\nHeathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother s power.",
      "With your husband s money, Miss Catherine?",
      "I asked.",
      "You ll find him\nnot so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I m hardly a judge, I\nthink that s the worst motive you ve given yet for being the wife of\nyoung Linton.",
      "It is not,  retorted she;  it is the best!",
      "The others were the\nsatisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar s sake, too, to satisfy him.",
      "This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings\nto Edgar and myself.",
      "I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody\nhave a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond\nyou.",
      "What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained\nhere?",
      "My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff s miseries,\nand I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in\nliving is himself.",
      "If all else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should\nstill continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were\nannihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not\nseem a part of it.",
      "My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods:\ntime will change it, I m well aware, as winter changes the trees.",
      "My\nlove for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of\nlittle visible delight, but necessary.",
      "Nelly, I _am_ Heathcliff!",
      "He s\nalways, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always\na pleasure to myself, but as my own being.",
      "So don t talk of our\nseparation again: it is impracticable; and \n\nShe paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\nforcibly away.",
      "I was out of patience with her folly!",
      "If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,  I said,  it only goes\nto convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in\nmarrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl.",
      "But trouble\nme with no more secrets: I ll not promise to keep them.",
      "You ll keep that?",
      "she asked, eagerly.",
      "No, I ll not promise,  I repeated.",
      "She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our\nconversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed\nHareton, while I made the supper.",
      "After it was cooked, my\nfellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr.\nHindley; and we didn t settle it till all was nearly cold.",
      "Then we came\nto the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we\nfeared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time\nalone.",
      "And how isn t that nowt comed in fro  th  field, be this time?",
      "What is\nhe about?",
      "girt idle seeght!",
      "demanded the old man, looking round for\nHeathcliff.",
      "I ll call him,  I replied.",
      "He s in the barn, I ve no doubt.",
      "I went and called, but got no answer.",
      "On returning, I whispered to\nCatherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure;\nand told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her\nbrother s conduct regarding him.",
      "She jumped up in a fine fright, flung\nHareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not\ntaking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk\nwould have affected him.",
      "She was absent such a while that Joseph\nproposed we should wait no longer.",
      "He cunningly conjectured they were\nstaying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.",
      "They\nwere  ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,  he affirmed.",
      "And on their\nbehalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual\nquarter-of-an-hour s supplication before meat, and would have tacked\nanother to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in\nupon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and,\nwherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly!",
      "I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,  she said.",
      "And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not\nreply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.",
      "Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to\nsuffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and\nwalked grumbling forth.",
      "Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the\nfloor, exclaiming I wonder where he is I wonder where he _can_ be!",
      "What did I say, Nelly?",
      "I ve forgotten.",
      "Was he vexed at my bad humour\nthis afternoon?",
      "Dear!",
      "tell me what I ve said to grieve him?",
      "I do wish\nhe d come.",
      "I do wish he would!",
      "What a noise for nothing!",
      "I cried, though rather uneasy myself.",
      "What\na trifle scares you!",
      "It s surely no great cause of alarm that\nHeathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie\ntoo sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft.",
      "I ll engage he s lurking\nthere.",
      "See if I don t ferret him out!",
      "I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and\nJoseph s quest ended in the same.",
      "Yon lad gets war und war!",
      "observed he on re-entering.",
      "He s left th \ngate at t  full swing, and Miss s pony has trodden dahn two rigs o \ncorn, and plottered through, raight o er into t  meadow!",
      "Hahsomdiver,\nt  maister  ull play t  devil to-morn, and he ll do weel.",
      "He s patience\nitsseln wi  sich careless, offald craters patience itsseln he is!",
      "Bud\nhe ll not be soa allus yah s see, all on ye!",
      "Yah mun n t drive him out\nof his heead for nowt!",
      "Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?",
      "interrupted Catherine.",
      "Have you\nbeen looking for him, as I ordered?",
      "I sud more likker look for th  horse,  he replied.",
      "It  ud be to more\nsense.",
      "Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike\nthis as black as t  chimbley!",
      "und Heathcliff s noan t  chap to coom at\n_my_ whistle happen he ll be less hard o  hearing wi  _ye_!",
      "It _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined\nto thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain\nwould be certain to bring him home without further trouble.",
      "However,\nCatherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.",
      "She kept wandering\nto and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which\npermitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one\nside of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations\nand the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash\naround her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and\nthen crying outright.",
      "She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good\npassionate fit of crying.",
      "About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the\nHeights in full fury.",
      "There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and\neither one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building:\na huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the\neast chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the\nkitchen-fire.",
      "We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and\nJoseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the\npatriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,\nthough he smote the ungodly.",
      "I felt some sentiment that it must be a\njudgment on us also.",
      "The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I\nshook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet\nliving.",
      "He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion\nvociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might\nbe drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.",
      "But\nthe uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;\nexcepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in\nrefusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to\ncatch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes.",
      "She came in\nand lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to\nthe back, and putting her hands before it.",
      "Well, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, touching her shoulder;  you are not bent on\ngetting your death, are you?",
      "Do you know what o clock it is?",
      "Half-past\ntwelve.",
      "Come, come to bed!",
      "there s no use waiting any longer on that\nfoolish boy: he ll be gone to Gimmerton, and he ll stay there now.",
      "He\nguesses we shouldn t wait for him till this late hour: at least, he\nguesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he d rather avoid having\nthe door opened by the master.",
      "Nay, nay, he s noan at Gimmerton,  said Joseph.",
      "I s niver wonder but\nhe s at t  bothom of a bog-hoile.",
      "This visitation worn t for nowt, and\nI wod hev  ye to look out, Miss yah muh be t  next.",
      "Thank Hivin for\nall!",
      "All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out\nfro  th  rubbidge!",
      "Yah knaw whet t  Scripture ses.",
      "And he began\nquoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we\nmight find them.",
      "I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet\nthings, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed\nwith little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping\nround him.",
      "I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I\ndistinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.",
      "Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing\nthe chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the\nfireplace.",
      "The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its\nunclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen\nhearth, haggard and drowsy.",
      "What ails you, Cathy?",
      "he was saying when I entered:  you look as\ndismal as a drowned whelp.",
      "Why are you so damp and pale, child?",
      "I ve been wet,  she answered reluctantly,  and I m cold, that s all.",
      "Oh, she is naughty!",
      "I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably\nsober.",
      "She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there\nshe has sat the night through, and I couldn t prevail on her to stir.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.",
      "The night through,  he\nrepeated.",
      "What kept her up?",
      "not fear of the thunder, surely?",
      "That was\nover hours since.",
      "Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff s absence, as long as we\ncould conceal it; so I replied, I didn t know how she took it into her\nhead to sit up; and she said nothing.",
      "The morning was fresh and cool; I\nthrew back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents\nfrom the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me,  Ellen, shut the\nwindow.",
      "I m starving!",
      "And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to\nthe almost extinguished embers.",
      "She s ill,  said Hindley, taking her wrist;  I suppose that s the\nreason she would not go to bed.",
      "Damn it!",
      "I don t want to be troubled\nwith more sickness here.",
      "What took you into the rain?",
      "Running after t  lads, as usuald!",
      "croaked Joseph, catching an\nopportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.",
      "If I war\nyah, maister, I d just slam t  boards i  their faces all on  em, gentle\nand simple!",
      "Never a day ut yah re off, but yon cat o  Linton comes\nsneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo s a fine lass!",
      "shoo sits watching\nfor ye i  t  kitchen; and as yah re in at one door, he s out at\nt other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side!",
      "It s\nbonny behaviour, lurking amang t  fields, after twelve o  t  night, wi \nthat fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!",
      "They think _I m_\nblind; but I m noan: nowt ut t  soart!",
      "I seed young Linton boath coming\nand going, and I seed _yah_  (directing his discourse to me),  yah\ngooid fur nowt, slattenly witch!",
      "nip up and bolt into th  house, t \nminute yah heard t  maister s horse-fit clatter up t  road.",
      "Silence, eavesdropper!",
      "cried Catherine;  none of your insolence\nbefore me!",
      "Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was\n_I_ who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have\nmet him as you were.",
      "You lie, Cathy, no doubt,  answered her brother,  and you are a\nconfounded simpleton!",
      "But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were\nyou not with Heathcliff last night?",
      "Speak the truth, now.",
      "You need not\nbe afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me\na good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of\nbreaking his neck.",
      "To prevent it, I shall send him about his business\nthis very morning; and after he s gone, I d advise you all to look\nsharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.",
      "I never saw Heathcliff last night,  answered Catherine, beginning to\nsob bitterly:  and if you do turn him out of doors, I ll go with him.",
      "But, perhaps, you ll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he s gone.",
      "Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her\nwords were inarticulate.",
      "Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get\nto her room immediately, or she shouldn t cry for nothing!",
      "I obliged\nher to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we\nreached her chamber: it terrified me.",
      "I thought she was going mad, and\nI begged Joseph to run for the doctor.",
      "It proved the commencement of\ndelirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her\ndangerously ill; she had a fever.",
      "He bled her, and he told me to let\nher live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw\nherself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had\nenough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary\ndistance between cottage and cottage.",
      "Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master\nwere no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong\nas a patient could be, she weathered it through.",
      "Old Mrs. Linton paid\nus several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded\nand ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted\non conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were\nvery grateful.",
      "But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness:\nshe and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of\neach other.",
      "Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and\nhaughtier than ever.",
      "Heathcliff had never been heard of since the\nevening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when\nshe had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance\non her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew.",
      "From that period,\nfor several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save\nin the relation of a mere servant.",
      "Joseph fell under a ban also: he\n_would_ speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a\nlittle girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and\nthought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with\nconsideration.",
      "Then the doctor had said that she would not bear\ncrossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less\nthan murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and\ncontradict her.",
      "From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof;\nand tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often\nattended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to\ndemand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.",
      "He was\nrather _too_ indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,\nbut from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the\nfamily by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him\nalone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!",
      "Edgar\nLinton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was\ninfatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he\nled her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father s\ndeath.",
      "Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights\nand accompany her here.",
      "Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I\nhad just begun to teach him his letters.",
      "We made a sad parting; but\nCatherine s tears were more powerful than ours.",
      "When I refused to go,\nand when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting\nto her husband and brother.",
      "The former offered me munificent wages; the\nlatter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,\nnow that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should\ntake him in hand, by-and-by.",
      "And so I had but one choice left: to do as\nI was ordered.",
      "I told the master he got rid of all decent people only\nto run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and\nsince then he has been a stranger: and it s very queer to think it, but\nI ve no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and\nthat he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nAt this point of the housekeeper s story she chanced to glance towards\nthe time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the\nminute-hand measure half-past one.",
      "She would not hear of staying a\nsecond longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of\nher narrative myself.",
      "And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I\nhave meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go\nalso, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.",
      "CHAPTER X\n\n\nA charming introduction to a hermit s life!",
      "Four weeks  torture,\ntossing, and sickness!",
      "Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,\nand impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons!",
      "And oh, this\ndearth of the human physiognomy!",
      "and, worse than all, the terrible\nintimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till\nspring!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.",
      "About seven days ago\nhe sent me a brace of grouse the last of the season.",
      "Scoundrel!",
      "He is\nnot altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a\ngreat mind to tell him.",
      "But, alas!",
      "how could I offend a man who was\ncharitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some\nother subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?",
      "This is\nquite an easy interval.",
      "I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could\nenjoy something interesting.",
      "Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her\ntale?",
      "I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.",
      "Yes:\nI remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three\nyears; and the heroine was married.",
      "I ll ring: she ll be delighted to\nfind me capable of talking cheerfully.",
      "Mrs. Dean came.",
      "It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,  she commenced.",
      "Away, away with it!",
      "I replied;  I desire to have \n\n The doctor says you must drop the powders.",
      "With all my heart!",
      "Don t interrupt me.",
      "Come and take your seat here.",
      "Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.",
      "Draw your knitting\nout of your pocket that will do now continue the history of Mr.\nHeathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day.",
      "Did he finish\nhis education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman?",
      "or did he\nget a sizar s place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours\nby drawing blood from his foster-country?",
      "or make a fortune more\npromptly on the English highways?",
      "He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I\ncouldn t give my word for any.",
      "I stated before that I didn t know how\nhe gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise\nhis mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with\nyour leave, I ll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse\nand not weary you.",
      "Are you feeling better this morning?",
      "Much.",
      "That s good news.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nI got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my\nagreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to\nexpect.",
      "She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his\nsister she showed plenty of affection.",
      "They were both very attentive to\nher comfort, certainly.",
      "It was not the thorn bending to the\nhoneysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.",
      "There were no\nmutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who\n_can_ be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither\nopposition nor indifference?",
      "I observed that Mr. Edgar had a\ndeep-rooted fear of ruffling her humour.",
      "He concealed it from her; but\nif ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow\ncloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a\nfrown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account.",
      "He many a\ntime spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab\nof a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing\nhis lady vexed.",
      "Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less\ntouchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as\nharmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it.",
      "Catherine\nhad seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with\nsympathising silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration\nin her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never\nsubject to depression of spirits before.",
      "The return of sunshine was\nwelcomed by answering sunshine from him.",
      "I believe I may assert that\nthey were really in possession of deep and growing happiness.",
      "It ended.",
      "Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild\nand generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it\nended when circumstances caused each to feel that the one s interest\nwas not the chief consideration in the other s thoughts.",
      "On a mellow\nevening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket\nof apples which I had been gathering.",
      "It had got dusk, and the moon\nlooked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to\nlurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the\nbuilding.",
      "I set my burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and\nlingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet\nair; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I\nheard a voice behind me say, Nelly, is that you?",
      "It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in\nthe manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.",
      "I\nturned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut,\nand I had seen nobody on approaching the steps.",
      "Something stirred in\nthe porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in\ndark clothes, with dark face and hair.",
      "He leant against the side, and\nheld his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.",
      "Who\ncan it be?",
      "I thought.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "The voice has no\nresemblance to his.",
      "I have waited here an hour,  he resumed, while I continued staring;\n and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.",
      "I\ndared not enter.",
      "You do not know me?",
      "Look, I m not a stranger!",
      "A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered\nwith black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and\nsingular.",
      "I remembered the eyes.",
      "What!",
      "I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,\nand I raised my hands in amazement.",
      "What!",
      "you come back?",
      "Is it really\nyou?",
      "Is it?",
      "Yes, Heathcliff,  he replied, glancing from me up to the windows,\nwhich reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from\nwithin.",
      "Are they at home?",
      "where is she?",
      "Nelly, you are not glad!",
      "you\nneedn t be so disturbed.",
      "Is she here?",
      "Speak!",
      "I want to have one word\nwith her your mistress.",
      "Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires\nto see her.",
      "How will she take it?",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "What will she do?",
      "The surprise\nbewilders me it will put her out of her head!",
      "And you _are_ Heathcliff!",
      "But altered!",
      "Nay, there s no comprehending it.",
      "Have you been for a\nsoldier?",
      "Go and carry my message,  he interrupted, impatiently.",
      "I m in hell\ntill you do!",
      "He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where\nMr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.",
      "At\nlength I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the\ncandles lighted, and I opened the door.",
      "They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,\nand displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the\nvalley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top\n(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the\nsough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of\nthe glen).",
      "Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our\nold house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.",
      "Both\nthe room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked\nwondrously peaceful.",
      "I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand;\nand was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my\nquestion about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to\nreturn, and mutter,  A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma am.",
      "What does he want?",
      "asked Mrs. Linton.",
      "I did not question him,  I answered.",
      "Well, close the curtains, Nelly,  she said;  and bring up tea.",
      "I ll be\nback again directly.",
      "She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.",
      "Some one mistress does not expect,  I replied.",
      "That Heathcliff you\nrecollect him, sir who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw s. \n\n What!",
      "the gipsy the ploughboy?",
      "he cried.",
      "Why did you not say so to\nCatherine?",
      "Hush!",
      "you must not call him by those names, master,  I said.",
      "She d be\nsadly grieved to hear you.",
      "She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.",
      "I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.",
      "Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that\noverlooked the court.",
      "He unfastened it, and leant out.",
      "I suppose they\nwere below, for he exclaimed quickly:  Don t stand there, love!",
      "Bring\nthe person in, if it be anyone particular.",
      "Ere long, I heard the click\nof the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too\nexcited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have\nsurmised an awful calamity.",
      "Oh, Edgar, Edgar!",
      "she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.",
      "Oh,\nEdgar darling!",
      "Heathcliff s come back he is!",
      "And she tightened her\nembrace to a squeeze.",
      "Well, well,  cried her husband, crossly,  don t strangle me for that!",
      "He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.",
      "There is no need to\nbe frantic!",
      "I know you didn t like him,  she answered, repressing a little the\nintensity of her delight.",
      "Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.",
      "Shall I tell him to come up?",
      "Here,  he said,  into the parlour?",
      "Where else?",
      "she asked.",
      "He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for\nhim.",
      "Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression half angry, half\nlaughing at his fastidiousness.",
      "No,  she added, after a while;  I cannot sit in the kitchen.",
      "Set two\ntables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being\ngentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.",
      "Will that please you, dear?",
      "Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?",
      "If\nso, give directions.",
      "I ll run down and secure my guest.",
      "I m afraid the\njoy is too great to be real!",
      "She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.",
      "_You_ bid him step up,  he said, addressing me;  and, Catherine, try\nto be glad, without being absurd.",
      "The whole household need not witness\nthe sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.",
      "I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently\nanticipating an invitation to enter.",
      "He followed my guidance without\nwaste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and\nmistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.",
      "But the\nlady s glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the\ndoor: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton;\nand then she seized Linton s reluctant fingers and crushed them into\nhis.",
      "Now, fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed,\nmore than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.",
      "He had\ngrown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed\nquite slender and youth-like.",
      "His upright carriage suggested the idea\nof his having been in the army.",
      "His countenance was much older in\nexpression and decision of feature than Mr. Linton s; it looked\nintelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation.",
      "A\nhalf-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full\nof black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified:\nquite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace.",
      "My master s\nsurprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss\nhow to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.",
      "Heathcliff dropped\nhis slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to\nspeak.",
      "Sit down, sir,  he said, at length.",
      "Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,\nwould have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am\ngratified when anything occurs to please her.",
      "And I also,  answered Heathcliff,  especially if it be anything in\nwhich I have a part.",
      "I shall stay an hour or two willingly.",
      "He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if\nshe feared he would vanish were she to remove it.",
      "He did not raise his\nto her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed\nback, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from\nhers.",
      "They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer\nembarrassment.",
      "Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a\nfeeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across\nthe rug, seized Heathcliff s hands again, and laughed like one beside\nherself.",
      "I shall think it a dream to-morrow!",
      "she cried.",
      "I shall not be able\nto believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.",
      "And yet, cruel Heathcliff!",
      "you don t deserve this welcome.",
      "To be absent\nand silent for three years, and never to think of me!",
      "A little more than you have thought of me,  he murmured.",
      "I heard of\nyour marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard\nbelow, I meditated this plan just to have one glimpse of your face, a\nstare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle\nmy score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on\nmyself.",
      "Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of\nmeeting me with another aspect next time!",
      "Nay, you ll not drive me off\nagain.",
      "You were really sorry for me, were you?",
      "Well, there was cause.",
      "I ve fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and\nyou must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!",
      "Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the\ntable,  interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and\na due measure of politeness.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk,\nwherever he may lodge to-night; and I m thirsty.",
      "She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by\nthe bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.",
      "The meal hardly endured ten minutes.",
      "Catherine s cup was never filled:\nshe could neither eat nor drink.",
      "Edgar had made a slop in his saucer,\nand scarcely swallowed a mouthful.",
      "Their guest did not protract his\nstay that evening above an hour longer.",
      "I asked, as he departed, if he\nwent to Gimmerton?",
      "No, to Wuthering Heights,  he answered:  Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when\nI called this morning.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_!",
      "and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!",
      "I pondered\nthis sentence painfully, after he was gone.",
      "Is he turning out a bit of\na hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a\ncloak?",
      "I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he\nhad better have remained away.",
      "About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.\nLinton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and\npulling me by the hair to rouse me.",
      "I cannot rest, Ellen,  she said, by way of apology.",
      "And I want some\nliving creature to keep me company in my happiness!",
      "Edgar is sulky,\nbecause I m glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to\nopen his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he\naffirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so\nsick and sleepy.",
      "He always contrives to be sick at the least cross!",
      "I\ngave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for\na headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.",
      "What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?",
      "I answered.",
      "As lads they\nhad an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much\nto hear him praised: it s human nature.",
      "Let Mr. Linton alone about him,\nunless you would like an open quarrel between them.",
      "But does it not show great weakness?",
      "pursued she.",
      "I m not envious: I\nnever feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella s yellow hair and the\nwhiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the\nfamily exhibit for her.",
      "Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute\nsometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish\nmother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper.",
      "It\npleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me.",
      "But they\nare very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was\nmade for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart\nchastisement might improve them all the same.",
      "You re mistaken, Mrs. Linton,  said I.",
      "They humour you: I know what\nthere would be to do if they did not.",
      "You can well afford to indulge\ntheir passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your\ndesires.",
      "You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal\nconsequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very\ncapable of being as obstinate as you.",
      "And then we shall fight to the death, sha n t we, Nelly?",
      "she\nreturned, laughing.",
      "No!",
      "I tell you, I have such faith in Linton s\nlove, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn t wish to\nretaliate.",
      "I advised her to value him the more for his affection.",
      "I do,  she answered,  but he needn t resort to whining for trifles.",
      "It\nis childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that\nHeathcliff was now worthy of anyone s regard, and it would honour the\nfirst gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said\nit for me, and been delighted from sympathy.",
      "He must get accustomed to\nhim, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason\nto object to him, I m sure he behaved excellently!",
      "What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?",
      "I inquired.",
      "He\nis reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering\nthe right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!",
      "He explained it,  she replied.",
      "I wonder as much as you.",
      "He said he\ncalled to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you\nresided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to\nquestioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;\nand finally, desired him to walk in.",
      "There were some persons sitting at\ncards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,\nfinding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again\nin the evening: to which he consented.",
      "Hindley is too reckless to\nselect his acquaintance prudently: he doesn t trouble himself to\nreflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has\nbasely injured.",
      "But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for\nresuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install\nhimself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an\nattachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope\nthat I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could\nhave if he settled in Gimmerton.",
      "He means to offer liberal payment for\npermission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother s\ncovetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy;\nthough what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.",
      "It s a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!",
      "said I.",
      "Have you no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?",
      "None for my friend,  she replied:  his strong head will keep him from\ndanger; a little for Hindley: but he can t be made morally worse than\nhe is; and I stand between him and bodily harm.",
      "The event of this\nevening has reconciled me to God and humanity!",
      "I had risen in angry\nrebellion against Providence.",
      "Oh, I ve endured very, very bitter\nmisery, Nelly!",
      "If that creature knew how bitter, he d be ashamed to\ncloud its removal with idle petulance.",
      "It was kindness for him which\ninduced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently\nfelt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently\nas I.",
      "However, it s over, and I ll take no revenge on his folly; I can\nafford to suffer anything hereafter!",
      "Should the meanest thing alive\nslap me on the cheek, I d not only turn the other, but I d ask pardon\nfor provoking it; and, as a proof, I ll go make my peace with Edgar\ninstantly.",
      "Good-night!",
      "I m an angel!",
      "In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her\nfulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only\nabjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by\nCatherine s exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to\nher taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and\nshe rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in\nreturn as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and\nservants profiting from the perpetual sunshine.",
      "Heathcliff Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future used the liberty of\nvisiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed\nestimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion.",
      "Catherine, also,\ndeemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in\nreceiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected.",
      "He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was\nremarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of\nfeeling.",
      "My master s uneasiness experienced a lull, and further\ncircumstances diverted it into another channel for a space.",
      "His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of\nIsabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards\nthe tolerated guest.",
      "She was at that time a charming young lady of\neighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen\nfeelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated.",
      "Her brother, who loved\nher tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference.",
      "Leaving aside\nthe degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible\nfact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such\na one s power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff s disposition: to\nknow that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable\nand unchanged.",
      "And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank\nforebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to its keeping.",
      "He\nwould have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment\nrose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation\nof sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the\nblame on Heathcliff s deliberate designing.",
      "We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and\npined over something.",
      "She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and\nteasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her\nlimited patience.",
      "We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of\nill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.",
      "But one day,\nwhen she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,\ncomplaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the\nmistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar\nneglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left\nopen, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a\nhundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily\ninsisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily,\nthreatened to send for the doctor.",
      "Mention of Kenneth caused her to\nexclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only\nCatherine s harshness which made her unhappy.",
      "How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?",
      "cried the mistress,\namazed at the unreasonable assertion.",
      "You are surely losing your\nreason.",
      "When have I been harsh, tell me?",
      "Yesterday,  sobbed Isabella,  and now!",
      "Yesterday!",
      "said her sister-in-law.",
      "On what occasion?",
      "In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased,\nwhile you sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "And that s your notion of harshness?",
      "said Catherine, laughing.",
      "It\nwas no hint that your company was superfluous; we didn t care whether\nyou kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff s talk would have\nnothing entertaining for your ears.",
      "Oh, no,  wept the young lady;  you wished me away, because you knew I\nliked to be there!",
      "Is she sane?",
      "asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me.",
      "I ll repeat our\nconversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it\ncould have had for you.",
      "I don t mind the conversation,  she answered:  I wanted to be with \n\n Well?",
      "said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the\nsentence.",
      "With him: and I won t be always sent off!",
      "she continued, kindling up.",
      "You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but\nyourself!",
      "You are an impertinent little monkey!",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\nsurprise.",
      "But I ll not believe this idiocy!",
      "It is impossible that you\ncan covet the admiration of Heathcliff that you consider him an\nagreeable person!",
      "I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?",
      "No, you have not,  said the infatuated girl.",
      "I love him more than\never you loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!",
      "I wouldn t be you for a kingdom, then!",
      "Catherine declared,\nemphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely.",
      "Nelly, help me to\nconvince her of her madness.",
      "Tell her what Heathcliff is: an\nunreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid\nwilderness of furze and whinstone.",
      "I d as soon put that little canary\ninto the park on a winter s day, as recommend you to bestow your heart\non him!",
      "It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing\nelse, which makes that dream enter your head.",
      "Pray, don t imagine that\nhe conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern\nexterior!",
      "He s not a rough diamond a pearl-containing oyster of a\nrustic: he s a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man.",
      "I never say to him,  Let\nthis or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to\nharm them;  I say,  Let them alone, because _I_ should hate them to be\nwronged:  and he d crush you like a sparrow s egg, Isabella, if he\nfound you a troublesome charge.",
      "I know he couldn t love a Linton; and\nyet he d be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations:\navarice is growing with him a besetting sin.",
      "There s my picture: and\nI m his friend so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you,\nI should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his\ntrap.",
      "Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.",
      "For shame!",
      "for shame!",
      "she repeated, angrily.",
      "You are worse than\ntwenty foes, you poisonous friend!",
      "Ah!",
      "you won t believe me, then?",
      "said Catherine.",
      "You think I speak\nfrom wicked selfishness?",
      "I m certain you do,  retorted Isabella;  and I shudder at you!",
      "Good!",
      "cried the other.",
      "Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I\nhave done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.",
      "And I must suffer for her egotism!",
      "she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left\nthe room.",
      "All, all is against me: she has blighted my single\nconsolation.",
      "But she uttered falsehoods, didn t she?",
      "Mr. Heathcliff is\nnot a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he\nremember her?",
      "Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,  I said.",
      "He s a bird of bad\nomen: no mate for you.",
      "Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can t\ncontradict her.",
      "She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any\none besides; and she never would represent him as worse than he is.",
      "Honest people don t hide their deeds.",
      "How has he been living?",
      "how has\nhe got rich?",
      "why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man\nwhom he abhors?",
      "They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.",
      "They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been\nborrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I\nheard only a week ago it was Joseph who told me I met him at Gimmerton:\n Nelly,  he said,  we s hae a crowner s  quest enow, at ahr folks .",
      "One\non  em  s a most getten his finger cut off wi  hauding t  other fro \nstickin  hisseln loike a cawlf.",
      "That s maister, yah knaw,  at  s soa\nup o  going tuh t  grand  sizes.",
      "He s noan feared o  t  bench o \njudges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on\n em, not he!",
      "He fair likes he langs to set his brazened face agean  em!",
      "And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he s a rare  un.",
      "He can girn a\nlaugh as well  s onybody at a raight divil s jest.",
      "Does he niver say\nnowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t  Grange?",
      "This is t \nway on  t: up at sun-down: dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und\ncan le-light till next day at noon: then, t  fooil gangs banning un\nraving to his cham er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i  thur\nlugs fur varry shame; un  the knave, why he can caint his brass, un \nate, un  sleep, un  off to his neighbour s to gossip wi  t  wife.",
      "I \ncourse, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur s goold runs into his\npocket, and her fathur s son gallops down t  broad road, while he flees\nafore to oppen t  pikes!",
      "Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal,\nbut no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff s conduct be true, you\nwould never think of desiring such a husband, would you?",
      "You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!",
      "she replied.",
      "I ll not listen\nto your slanders.",
      "What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me\nthat there is no happiness in the world!",
      "Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or\npersevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time\nto reflect.",
      "The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next\ntown; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his\nabsence, called rather earlier than usual.",
      "Catherine and Isabella were\nsitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter\nalarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of\nher secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on\nmature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she\nlaughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter\nto _her_.",
      "She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window.",
      "I was\nsweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.",
      "Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the\ndoor opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would\ngladly have done had it been practicable.",
      "Come in, that s right!",
      "exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair\nto the fire.",
      "Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the\nice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.",
      "Heathcliff, I m proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you\nmore than myself.",
      "I expect you to feel flattered.",
      "Nay, it s not Nelly;\ndon t look at her!",
      "My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart\nby mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.",
      "It lies in\nyour own power to be Edgar s brother!",
      "No, no, Isabella, you sha n t run\noff,  she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the\nconfounded girl, who had risen indignantly.",
      "We were quarrelling like\ncats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of\ndevotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would\nbut have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself\nto be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever,\nand send my image into eternal oblivion!",
      "Catherine!",
      "said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to\nstruggle from the tight grasp that held her,  I d thank you to adhere\nto the truth and not slander me, even in joke!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, be kind\nenough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and\nI are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me\nbeyond expression.",
      "As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly\nindifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned\nand whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.",
      "By no means!",
      "cried Mrs. Linton in answer.",
      "I won t be named a dog in\nthe manger again.",
      "You _shall_ stay: now then!",
      "Heathcliff, why don t you\nevince satisfaction at my pleasant news?",
      "Isabella swears that the love\nEdgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.",
      "I m sure\nshe made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen?",
      "And she has\nfasted ever since the day before yesterday s walk, from sorrow and rage\nthat I despatched her out of your society under the idea of its being\nunacceptable.",
      "I think you belie her,  said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face\nthem.",
      "She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!",
      "And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a\nstrange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,\nwhich curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it\nraises.",
      "The poor thing couldn t bear that; she grew white and red in\nrapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength\nof her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and\nperceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another\nclosed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to\nmake use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the\ndetainer s with crescents of red.",
      "There s a tigress!",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and\nshaking her hand with pain.",
      "Begone, for God s sake, and hide your\nvixen face!",
      "How foolish to reveal those talons to _him_.",
      "Can t you\nfancy the conclusions he ll draw?",
      "Look, Heathcliff!",
      "they are\ninstruments that will do execution you must beware of your eyes.",
      "I d wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,  he\nanswered, brutally, when the door had closed after her.",
      "But what did\nyou mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?",
      "You were not\nspeaking the truth, were you?",
      "I assure you I was,  she returned.",
      "She has been dying for your sake\nseveral weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a\ndeluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,\nfor the purpose of mitigating her adoration.",
      "But don t notice it\nfurther: I wished to punish her sauciness, that s all.",
      "I like her too\nwell, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her\nup.",
      "And I like her too ill to attempt it,  said he,  except in a very\nghoulish fashion.",
      "You d hear of odd things if I lived alone with that\nmawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white\nthe colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day\nor two: they detestably resemble Linton s. \n\n Delectably!",
      "observed Catherine.",
      "They are dove s eyes angel s!",
      "She s her brother s heir, is she not?",
      "he asked, after a brief\nsilence.",
      "I should be sorry to think so,  returned his companion.",
      "Half a dozen\nnephews shall erase her title, please heaven!",
      "Abstract your mind from\nthe subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour s\ngoods; remember _this_ neighbour s goods are mine.",
      "If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,  said\nHeathcliff;  but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely\nmad; and, in short, we ll dismiss the matter, as you advise.",
      "From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from\nher thoughts.",
      "The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the\ncourse of the evening.",
      "I saw him smile to himself grin rather and lapse\ninto ominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from\nthe apartment.",
      "I determined to watch his movements.",
      "My heart invariably cleaved to the\nmaster s, in preference to Catherine s side: with reason I imagined,\nfor he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she she could not be\ncalled the _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide\nlatitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less\nsympathy for her feelings.",
      "I wanted something to happen which might\nhave the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr.\nHeathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.",
      "His\nvisits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master\nalso.",
      "His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.",
      "I\nfelt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked\nwanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting\nhis time to spring and destroy.",
      "CHAPTER XI\n\n\nSometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I ve got up in\na sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the\nfarm.",
      "I ve persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how\npeople talked regarding his ways; and then I ve recollected his\nconfirmed bad habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched\nfrom re-entering the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken\nat my word.",
      "One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to\nGimmerton.",
      "It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a\nbright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry.",
      "I\ncame to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your\nleft hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north\nside, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a\nguide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.",
      "The sun shone\nyellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why,\nbut all at once a gush of child s sensations flowed into my heart.",
      "Hindley and I held it a favourite spot twenty years before.",
      "I gazed\nlong at the weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole\nnear the bottom still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were\nfond of storing there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as\nreality, it appeared that I beheld my early playmate seated on the\nwithered turf: his dark, square head bent forward, and his little hand\nscooping out the earth with a piece of slate.",
      "Poor Hindley!",
      "I\nexclaimed, involuntarily.",
      "I started: my bodily eye was cheated into a\nmomentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight\ninto mine!",
      "It vanished in a twinkling; but immediately I felt an\nirresistible yearning to be at the Heights.",
      "Superstition urged me to\ncomply with this impulse: supposing he should be dead!",
      "I thought or\nshould die soon!",
      "supposing it were a sign of death!",
      "The nearer I got to\nthe house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of it I\ntrembled in every limb.",
      "The apparition had outstripped me: it stood\nlooking through the gate.",
      "That was my first idea on observing an\nelf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the\nbars.",
      "Further reflection suggested this must be Hareton, _my_ Hareton,\nnot altered greatly since I left him, ten months since.",
      "God bless thee, darling!",
      "I cried, forgetting instantaneously my\nfoolish fears.",
      "Hareton, it s Nelly!",
      "Nelly, thy nurse.",
      "He retreated out of arm s length, and picked up a large flint.",
      "I am come to see thy father, Hareton,  I added, guessing from the\naction that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not\nrecognised as one with me.",
      "He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but\ncould not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,\nfrom the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses,\nwhich, whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with\npractised emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking\nexpression of malignity.",
      "You may be certain this grieved more than\nangered me.",
      "Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it\nto propitiate him.",
      "He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as\nif he fancied I only intended to tempt and disappoint him.",
      "I showed\nanother, keeping it out of his reach.",
      "Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?",
      "I inquired.",
      "The\ncurate?",
      "Damn the curate, and thee!",
      "Gie me that,  he replied.",
      "Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,  said I.",
      "Who s your master?",
      "Devil daddy,  was his answer.",
      "And what do you learn from daddy?",
      "I continued.",
      "He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.",
      "What does he teach you?",
      "I\nasked.",
      "Naught,  said he,  but to keep out of his gait.",
      "Daddy cannot bide me,\nbecause I swear at him.",
      "Ah!",
      "and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?",
      "I observed.",
      "Ay nay,  he drawled.",
      "Who, then?",
      "Heathcliff.",
      "I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Ay!",
      "he answered again.",
      "Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the\nsentences I known t: he pays dad back what he gies to me he curses\ndaddy for cursing me.",
      "He says I mun do as I will.",
      "And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?",
      "I pursued.",
      "No, I was told the curate should have his   teeth dashed down his  \nthroat, if he stepped over the threshold Heathcliff had promised that!",
      "I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman\ncalled Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.",
      "He\nwent up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,\nHeathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran\ndown the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I\ngained the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a\ngoblin.",
      "This is not much connected with Miss Isabella s affair: except\nthat it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and\ndoing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the\nGrange: even though I should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs.\nLinton s pleasure.",
      "The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some\npigeons in the court.",
      "She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law\nfor three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining,\nand we found it a great comfort.",
      "Heathcliff had not the habit of\nbestowing a single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.",
      "Now, as\nsoon as he beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping\nsurvey of the house-front.",
      "I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I\ndrew out of sight.",
      "He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said\nsomething: she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to\nprevent it, he laid his hand on her arm.",
      "She averted her face: he\napparently put some question which she had no mind to answer.",
      "There was\nanother rapid glance at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the\nscoundrel had the impudence to embrace her.",
      "Judas!",
      "Traitor!",
      "I ejaculated.",
      "You are a hypocrite, too, are you?",
      "A\ndeliberate deceiver.",
      "Who is, Nelly?",
      "said Catherine s voice at my elbow: I had been\nover-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.",
      "Your worthless friend!",
      "I answered, warmly:  the sneaking rascal\nyonder.",
      "Ah, he has caught a glimpse of us he is coming in!",
      "I wonder\nwill he have the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to\nMiss, when he told you he hated her?",
      "Mrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden;\nand a minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.",
      "I couldn t withhold\ngiving some loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on\nsilence, and threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to\nbe so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.",
      "To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!",
      "she cried.",
      "You want setting down in your right place!",
      "Heathcliff, what are you\nabout, raising this stir?",
      "I said you must let Isabella alone!",
      "I beg you\nwill, unless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to\ndraw the bolts against you!",
      "God forbid that he should try!",
      "answered the black villain.",
      "I detested\nhim just then.",
      "God keep him meek and patient!",
      "Every day I grow madder\nafter sending him to heaven!",
      "Hush!",
      "said Catherine, shutting the inner door.",
      "Don t vex me.",
      "Why\nhave you disregarded my request?",
      "Did she come across you on purpose?",
      "What is it to you?",
      "he growled.",
      "I have a right to kiss her, if she\nchooses; and you have no right to object.",
      "I am not _your_ husband:\n_you_ needn t be jealous of me!",
      "I m not jealous of you,  replied the mistress;  I m jealous for you.",
      "Clear your face: you sha n t scowl at me!",
      "If you like Isabella, you\nshall marry her.",
      "But do you like her?",
      "Tell the truth, Heathcliff!",
      "There, you won t answer.",
      "I m certain you don t. \n\n And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?",
      "I\ninquired.",
      "Mr. Linton should approve,  returned my lady, decisively.",
      "He might spare himself the trouble,  said Heathcliff:  I could do as\nwell without his approbation.",
      "And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind\nto speak a few words now, while we are at it.",
      "I want you to be aware\nthat I _know_ you have treated me infernally infernally!",
      "Do you hear?",
      "And if you flatter yourself that I don t perceive it, you are a fool;\nand if you think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot:\nand if you fancy I ll suffer unrevenged, I ll convince you of the\ncontrary, in a very little while!",
      "Meantime, thank you for telling me\nyour sister-in-law s secret: I swear I ll make the most of it.",
      "And\nstand you aside!",
      "What new phase of his character is this?",
      "exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\namazement.",
      "I ve treated you infernally and you ll take your revenge!",
      "How will you take it, ungrateful brute?",
      "How have I treated you\ninfernally?",
      "I seek no revenge on you,  replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.",
      "That s not the plan.",
      "The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don t\nturn against him; they crush those beneath them.",
      "You are welcome to\ntorture me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a\nlittle in the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are\nable.",
      "Having levelled my palace, don t erect a hovel and complacently\nadmire your own charity in giving me that for a home.",
      "If I imagined you\nreally wished me to marry Isabel, I d cut my throat!",
      "Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?",
      "cried Catherine.",
      "Well, I won t repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering\nSatan a lost soul.",
      "Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.",
      "You\nprove it.",
      "Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your\ncoming; I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us\nat peace, appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.",
      "Quarrel with Edgar, if\nyou please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you ll hit on exactly\nthe most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.",
      "The conversation ceased.",
      "Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and\ngloomy.",
      "The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could\nneither lay nor control it.",
      "He stood on the hearth with folded arms,\nbrooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek\nthe master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.",
      "Ellen,  said he, when I entered,  have you seen your mistress?",
      "Yes; she s in the kitchen, sir,  I answered.",
      "She s sadly put out by\nMr. Heathcliff s behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it s time to\narrange his visits on another footing.",
      "There s harm in being too soft,\nand now it s come to this .",
      "And I related the scene in the court, and,\nas near as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.",
      "I fancied it could\nnot be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so\nafterwards, by assuming the defensive for her guest.",
      "Edgar Linton had\ndifficulty in hearing me to the close.",
      "His first words revealed that he\ndid not clear his wife of blame.",
      "This is insufferable!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "It is disgraceful that she\nshould own him for a friend, and force his company on me!",
      "Call me two\nmen out of the hall, Ellen.",
      "Catherine shall linger no longer to argue\nwith the low ruffian I have humoured her enough.",
      "He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,\nfollowed by me, to the kitchen.",
      "Its occupants had recommenced their\nangry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed\nvigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat\ncowed by her violent rating apparently.",
      "He saw the master first, and\nmade a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,\nabruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.",
      "How is this?",
      "said Linton, addressing her;  what notion of propriety\nmust you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to\nyou by that blackguard?",
      "I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you\nthink nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,\nimagine I can get used to it too!",
      "Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?",
      "asked the mistress, in a\ntone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both\ncarelessness and contempt of his irritation.",
      "Heathcliff, who had raised\nhis eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on\npurpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton s attention to him.",
      "He\nsucceeded; but Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high\nflights of passion.",
      "I ve been so far forbearing with you, sir,  he said quietly;  not that\nI was ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you\nwere only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up\nyour acquaintance, I acquiesced foolishly.",
      "Your presence is a moral\npoison that would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to\nprevent worse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into\nthis house, and give notice now that I require your instant departure.",
      "Three minutes  delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.",
      "Heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye\nfull of derision.",
      "Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!",
      "he said.",
      "It is in\ndanger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.",
      "By God!",
      "Mr. Linton,\nI m mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!",
      "My master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men:\nhe had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.",
      "I obeyed the\nhint; but Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I\nattempted to call them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and\nlocked it.",
      "Fair means!",
      "she said, in answer to her husband s look of angry\nsurprise.",
      "If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or\nallow yourself to be beaten.",
      "It will correct you of feigning more\nvalour than you possess.",
      "No, I ll swallow the key before you shall get\nit!",
      "I m delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!",
      "After constant\nindulgence of one s weak nature, and the other s bad one, I earn for\nthanks two samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!",
      "Edgar, I\nwas defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick,\nfor daring to think an evil thought of me!",
      "It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the\nmaster.",
      "He tried to wrest the key from Catherine s grasp, and for\nsafety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr.\nEdgar was taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew\ndeadly pale.",
      "For his life he could not avert that excess of emotion:\nmingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.",
      "He leant on\nthe back of a chair, and covered his face.",
      "Oh, heavens!",
      "In old days this would win you knighthood!",
      "exclaimed\nMrs. Linton.",
      "We are vanquished!",
      "we are vanquished!",
      "Heathcliff would as\nsoon lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a\ncolony of mice.",
      "Cheer up!",
      "you sha n t be hurt!",
      "Your type is not a lamb,\nit s a sucking leveret.",
      "I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!",
      "said her friend.",
      "I\ncompliment you on your taste.",
      "And that is the slavering, shivering\nthing you preferred to me!",
      "I would not strike him with my fist, but I d\nkick him with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.",
      "Is he\nweeping, or is he going to faint for fear?",
      "The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.",
      "He d better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and\nstruck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a\nslighter man.",
      "It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr.\nLinton walked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to\nthe front entrance.",
      "There!",
      "you ve done with coming here,  cried Catherine.",
      "Get away, now;\nhe ll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.",
      "If he\ndid overhear us, of course he d never forgive you.",
      "You ve played me an\nill turn, Heathcliff!",
      "But go make haste!",
      "I d rather see Edgar at bay\nthan you.",
      "Do you suppose I m going with that blow burning in my gullet?",
      "he\nthundered.",
      "By hell, no!",
      "I ll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut\nbefore I cross the threshold!",
      "If I don t floor him now, I shall murder\nhim some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!",
      "He is not coming,  I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.",
      "There s the\ncoachman and the two gardeners; you ll surely not wait to be thrust\ninto the road by them!",
      "Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very\nlikely, be watching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil\nhis orders.",
      "The gardeners and coachman _were_ there: but Linton was with them.",
      "They\nhad already entered the court.",
      "Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,\nresolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the\npoker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as\nthey tramped in.",
      "Mrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her upstairs.",
      "She did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was\nanxious to keep her in ignorance.",
      "I m nearly distracted, Nelly!",
      "she exclaimed, throwing herself on the\nsofa.",
      "A thousand smiths  hammers are beating in my head!",
      "Tell Isabella\nto shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else\naggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.",
      "And, Nelly, say to\nEdgar, if you see him again to-night, that I m in danger of being\nseriously ill.",
      "I wish it may prove true.",
      "He has startled and distressed\nme shockingly!",
      "I want to frighten him.",
      "Besides, he might come and begin\na string of abuse or complainings; I m certain I should recriminate,\nand God knows where we should end!",
      "Will you do so, my good Nelly?",
      "You\nare aware that I am no way blamable in this matter.",
      "What possessed him\nto turn listener?",
      "Heathcliff s talk was outrageous, after you left us;\nbut I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant\nnothing.",
      "Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool s craving to hear evil of\nself, that haunts some people like a demon!",
      "Had Edgar never gathered\nour conversation, he would never have been the worse for it.",
      "Really,\nwhen he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I\nhad scolded Heathcliff till I was hoarse for _him;_ I did not care\nhardly what they did to each other; especially as I felt that, however\nthe scene closed, we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how\nlong!",
      "Well, if I cannot keep Heathcliff for my friend if Edgar will be\nmean and jealous, I ll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.",
      "That will be a prompt way of finishing all, when I am pushed to\nextremity!",
      "But it s a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope; I d not\ntake Linton by surprise with it.",
      "To this point he has been discreet in\ndreading to provoke me; you must represent the peril of quitting that\npolicy, and remind him of my passionate temper, verging, when kindled,\non frenzy.",
      "I wish you could dismiss that apathy out of that\ncountenance, and look rather more anxious about me.",
      "The stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,\nrather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but\nI believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion\nto account, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control\nherself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish\nto  frighten  her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for\nthe purpose of serving her selfishness.",
      "Therefore I said nothing when I\nmet the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of\nturning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel\ntogether.",
      "He began to speak first.",
      "Remain where you are, Catherine,  he said; without any anger in his\nvoice, but with much sorrowful despondency.",
      "I shall not stay.",
      "I am\nneither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn\nwhether, after this evening s events, you intend to continue your\nintimacy with \n\n Oh, for mercy s sake,  interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot,\n for mercy s sake, let us hear no more of it now!",
      "Your cold blood\ncannot be worked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but\nmine are boiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.",
      "To get rid of me, answer my question,  persevered Mr. Linton.",
      "You\n_must_ answer it; and that violence does not alarm me.",
      "I have found\nthat you can be as stoical as anyone, when you please.",
      "Will you give up\nHeathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?",
      "It is impossible for you\nto be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely\n_require_ to know which you choose.",
      "I require to be let alone!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, furiously.",
      "I demand\nit!",
      "Don t you see I can scarcely stand?",
      "Edgar, you you leave me!",
      "She rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.",
      "It\nwas enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!",
      "There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and\ngrinding her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to\nsplinters!",
      "Mr. Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and\nfear.",
      "He told me to fetch some water.",
      "She had no breath for speaking.",
      "I\nbrought a glass full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her\nface.",
      "In a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up\nher eyes, while her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the\naspect of death.",
      "Linton looked terrified.",
      "There is nothing in the world the matter,  I whispered.",
      "I did not want\nhim to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.",
      "She has blood on her lips!",
      "he said, shuddering.",
      "Never mind!",
      "I answered, tartly.",
      "And I told him how she had resolved,\nprevious to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.",
      "I incautiously\ngave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up her hair\nflying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck\nand arms standing out preternaturally.",
      "I made up my mind for broken\nbones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then\nrushed from the room.",
      "The master directed me to follow; I did, to her\nchamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against\nme.",
      "As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to\nask whether she would have some carried up.",
      "No!",
      "she replied,\nperemptorily.",
      "The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and\nagain on the morrow after, and received the same answer.",
      "Mr. Linton, on\nhis part, spent his time in the library, and did not inquire concerning\nhis wife s occupations.",
      "Isabella and he had had an hour s interview,\nduring which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper\nhorror for Heathcliff s advances: but he could make nothing of her\nevasive replies, and was obliged to close the examination\nunsatisfactorily; adding, however, a solemn warning, that if she were\nso insane as to encourage that worthless suitor, it would dissolve all\nbonds of relationship between herself and him.",
      "CHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhile Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and\nalmost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books\nthat he never opened wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague\nexpectation that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her\nown accord to ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation and _she_ fasted\npertinaciously, under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was\nready to choke for her absence, and pride alone held him from running\nto cast himself at her feet; I went about my household duties,\nconvinced that the Grange had but one sensible soul in its walls, and\nthat lodged in my body.",
      "I wasted no condolences on Miss, nor any\nexpostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay much attention to the\nsighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady s name, since he might\nnot hear her voice.",
      "I determined they should come about as they pleased\nfor me; and though it was a tiresomely slow process, I began to rejoice\nat length in a faint dawn of its progress: as I thought at first.",
      "Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished\nthe water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a\nbasin of gruel, for she believed she was dying.",
      "That I set down as a\nspeech meant for Edgar s ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it\nto myself and brought her some tea and dry toast.",
      "She ate and drank\neagerly, and sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and\ngroaning.",
      "Oh, I will die,  she exclaimed,  since no one cares anything\nabout me.",
      "I wish I had not taken that.",
      "Then a good while after I heard\nher murmur,  No, I ll not die he d be glad he does not love me at\nall he would never miss me!",
      "Did you want anything, ma am?",
      "I inquired, still preserving my\nexternal composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange,\nexaggerated manner.",
      "What is that apathetic being doing?",
      "she demanded, pushing the thick\nentangled locks from her wasted face.",
      "Has he fallen into a lethargy,\nor is he dead?",
      "Neither,  replied I;  if you mean Mr. Linton.",
      "He s tolerably well, I\nthink, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is\ncontinually among his books, since he has no other society.",
      "I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I\ncould not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.",
      "Among his books!",
      "she cried, confounded.",
      "And I dying!",
      "I on the brink\nof the grave!",
      "My God!",
      "does he know how I m altered?",
      "continued she,\nstaring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite\nwall.",
      "Is that Catherine Linton?",
      "He imagines me in a pet in play,\nperhaps.",
      "Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?",
      "Nelly, if\nit be not too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I ll choose\nbetween these two: either to starve at once that would be no punishment\nunless he had a heart or to recover, and leave the country.",
      "Are you\nspeaking the truth about him now?",
      "Take care.",
      "Is he actually so utterly\nindifferent for my life?",
      "Why, ma am,  I answered,  the master has no idea of your being\nderanged; and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die\nof hunger.",
      "You think not?",
      "Cannot you tell him I will?",
      "she returned.",
      "Persuade\nhim!",
      "speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!",
      "No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,  I suggested,  that you have eaten some\nfood with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its\ngood effects.",
      "If I were only sure it would kill him,  she interrupted,  I d kill\nmyself directly!",
      "These three awful nights I ve never closed my lids and\noh, I ve been tormented!",
      "I ve been haunted, Nelly!",
      "But I begin to fancy\nyou don t like me.",
      "How strange!",
      "I thought, though everybody hated and\ndespised each other, they could not avoid loving me.",
      "And they have all\nturned to enemies in a few hours.",
      "_They_ have, I m positive; the people\n_here_.",
      "How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!",
      "Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be\nso dreadful to watch Catherine go.",
      "And Edgar standing solemnly by to\nsee it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace\nto his house, and going back to his _books_!",
      "What in the name of all\nthat feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?",
      "She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.\nLinton s philosophical resignation.",
      "Tossing about, she increased her\nfeverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;\nthen raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the\nwindow.",
      "We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the\nnorth-east, and I objected.",
      "Both the expressions flitting over her\nface, and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and\nbrought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor s\ninjunction that she should not be crossed.",
      "A minute previously she was\nviolent; now, supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey\nher, she seemed to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from\nthe rents she had just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to\ntheir different species: her mind had strayed to other associations.",
      "That s a turkey s,  she murmured to herself;  and this is a wild\nduck s; and this is a pigeon s. Ah, they put pigeons  feathers in the\npillows no wonder I couldn t die!",
      "Let me take care to throw it on the\nfloor when I lie down.",
      "And here is a moor-cock s; and this I should\nknow it among a thousand it s a lapwing s. Bonny bird; wheeling over\nour heads in the middle of the moor.",
      "It wanted to get to its nest, for\nthe clouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.",
      "This\nfeather was picked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its\nnest in the winter, full of little skeletons.",
      "Heathcliff set a trap\nover it, and the old ones dared not come.",
      "I made him promise he d never\nshoot a lapwing after that, and he didn t. Yes, here are more!",
      "Did he\nshoot my lapwings, Nelly?",
      "Are they red, any of them?",
      "Let me look.",
      "Give over with that baby-work!",
      "I interrupted, dragging the pillow\naway, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing\nits contents by handfuls.",
      "Lie down and shut your eyes: you re\nwandering.",
      "There s a mess!",
      "The down is flying about like snow.",
      "I went here and there collecting it.",
      "I see in you, Nelly,  she continued dreamily,  an aged woman: you have\ngrey hair and bent shoulders.",
      "This bed is the fairy cave under\nPenistone Crags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;\npretending, while I am near, that they are only locks of wool.",
      "That s\nwhat you ll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.",
      "I m\nnot wandering: you re mistaken, or else I should believe you really\n_were_ that withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone\nCrags; and I m conscious it s night, and there are two candles on the\ntable making the black press shine like jet.",
      "The black press?",
      "where is that?",
      "I asked.",
      "You are talking in your\nsleep!",
      "It s against the wall, as it always is,  she replied.",
      "It _does_\nappear odd I see a face in it!",
      "There s no press in the room, and never was,  said I, resuming my\nseat, and looping up the curtain that I might watch her.",
      "Don t _you_ see that face?",
      "she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\nmirror.",
      "And say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\nher own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.",
      "It s behind there still!",
      "she pursued, anxiously.",
      "And it stirred.",
      "Who\nis it?",
      "I hope it will not come out when you are gone!",
      "Oh!",
      "Nelly, the\nroom is haunted!",
      "I m afraid of being alone!",
      "I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of\nshudders convulsed her frame, and she _would_ keep straining her gaze\ntowards the glass.",
      "There s nobody here!",
      "I insisted.",
      "It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you\nknew it a while since.",
      "Myself!",
      "she gasped,  and the clock is striking twelve!",
      "It s true,\nthen!",
      "that s dreadful!",
      "Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.",
      "I\nattempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her\nhusband; but I was summoned back by a piercing shriek the shawl had\ndropped from the frame.",
      "Why, what _is_ the matter?",
      "cried I.",
      "Who is coward now?",
      "Wake up!",
      "That\nis the glass the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and\nthere am I too by your side.",
      "Trembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually\npassed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of\nshame.",
      "Oh, dear!",
      "I thought I was at home,  she sighed.",
      "I thought I was lying\nin my chamber at Wuthering Heights.",
      "Because I m weak, my brain got\nconfused, and I screamed unconsciously.",
      "Don t say anything; but stay\nwith me.",
      "I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.",
      "A sound sleep would do you good, ma am,  I answered:  and I hope this\nsuffering will prevent your trying starving again.",
      "Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!",
      "she went on\nbitterly, wringing her hands.",
      "And that wind sounding in the firs by\nthe lattice.",
      "Do let me feel it it comes straight down the moor do let\nme have one breath!",
      "To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.",
      "A cold blast\nrushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post.",
      "She lay still\nnow, her face bathed in tears.",
      "Exhaustion of body had entirely subdued\nher spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing child.",
      "How long is it since I shut myself in here?",
      "she asked, suddenly\nreviving.",
      "It was Monday evening,  I replied,  and this is Thursday night, or\nrather Friday morning, at present.",
      "What!",
      "of the same week?",
      "she exclaimed.",
      "Only that brief time?",
      "Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper, \nobserved I.",
      "Well, it seems a weary number of hours,  she muttered doubtfully:  it\nmust be more.",
      "I remember being in the parlour after they had\nquarrelled, and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this\nroom desperate.",
      "As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness\noverwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.",
      "I couldn t explain to Edgar\nhow certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he\npersisted in teasing me!",
      "I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he\ndid not guess my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to\nescape from him and his voice.",
      "Before I recovered sufficiently to see\nand hear, it began to be dawn, and, Nelly, I ll tell you what I\nthought, and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my\nreason.",
      "I thought as I lay there, with my head against that table leg,\nand my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window, that I was\nenclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home; and my heart ached with some\ngreat grief which, just waking, I could not recollect.",
      "I pondered, and\nworried myself to discover what it could be, and, most strangely, the\nwhole last seven years of my life grew a blank!",
      "I did not recall that\nthey had been at all.",
      "I was a child; my father was just buried, and my\nmisery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me\nand Heathcliff.",
      "I was laid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from\na dismal doze after a night of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the\npanels aside: it struck the table-top!",
      "I swept it along the carpet, and\nthen memory burst in: my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of\ndespair.",
      "I cannot say why I felt so wildly wretched: it must have been\ntemporary derangement; for there is scarcely cause.",
      "But, supposing at\ntwelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights, and every early\nassociation, and my all in all, as Heathcliff was at that time, and\nbeen converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross\nGrange, and the wife of a stranger: an exile, and outcast, thenceforth,\nfrom what had been my world.",
      "You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where\nI grovelled!",
      "Shake your head as you will, Nelly, _you_ have helped to\nunsettle me!",
      "You should have spoken to Edgar, indeed you should, and\ncompelled him to leave me quiet!",
      "Oh, I m burning!",
      "I wish I were out of\ndoors!",
      "I wish I were a girl again, half savage and hardy, and free; and\nlaughing at injuries, not maddening under them!",
      "Why am I so changed?",
      "why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words?",
      "I m sure I\nshould be myself were I once among the heather on those hills.",
      "Open the\nwindow again wide: fasten it open!",
      "Quick, why don t you move?",
      "Because I won t give you your death of cold,  I answered.",
      "You won t give me a chance of life, you mean,  she said sullenly.",
      "However, I m not helpless yet; I ll open it myself.",
      "And sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the\nroom, walking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless\nof the frosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.",
      "I\nentreated, and finally attempted to force her to retire.",
      "But I soon\nfound her delirious strength much surpassed mine (she _was_ delirious,\nI became convinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).",
      "There was no\nmoon, and everything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed\nfrom any house, far or near; all had been extinguished long ago: and\nthose at Wuthering Heights were never visible still she asserted she\ncaught their shining.",
      "Look!",
      "she cried eagerly,  that s my room with the candle in it, and\nthe trees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph s\ngarret.",
      "Joseph sits up late, doesn t he?",
      "He s waiting till I come home\nthat he may lock the gate.",
      "Well, he ll wait a while yet.",
      "It s a rough\njourney, and a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton\nKirk to go that journey!",
      "We ve braved its ghosts often together, and\ndared each other to stand among the graves and ask them to come.",
      "But,\nHeathcliff, if I dare you now, will you venture?",
      "If you do, I ll keep\nyou.",
      "I ll not lie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep,\nand throw the church down over me, but I won t rest till you are with\nme.",
      "I never will!",
      "She paused, and resumed with a strange smile.",
      "He s considering he d\nrather I d come to him!",
      "Find a way, then!",
      "not through that kirkyard.",
      "You are slow!",
      "Be content, you always followed me!",
      "Perceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I\ncould reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of\nherself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when,\nto my consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr.\nLinton entered.",
      "He had only then come from the library; and, in passing\nthrough the lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by\ncuriosity, or fear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.",
      "Oh, sir!",
      "I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the\nsight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.",
      "My poor\nmistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;\npray, come and persuade her to go to bed.",
      "Forget your anger, for she s\nhard to guide any way but her own.",
      "Catherine ill?",
      "he said, hastening to us.",
      "Shut the window, Ellen!",
      "Catherine!",
      "why \n\nHe was silent.",
      "The haggardness of Mrs. Linton s appearance smote him\nspeechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified\nastonishment.",
      "She s been fretting here,  I continued,  and eating scarcely anything,\nand never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening,\nand so we couldn t inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it\nourselves; but it is nothing.",
      "I felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.",
      "It is\nnothing, is it, Ellen Dean?",
      "he said sternly.",
      "You shall account more\nclearly for keeping me ignorant of this!",
      "And he took his wife in his\narms, and looked at her with anguish.",
      "At first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her\nabstracted gaze.",
      "The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her\neyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her\nattention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.",
      "Ah!",
      "you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?",
      "she said, with angry\nanimation.",
      "You are one of those things that are ever found when least\nwanted, and when you are wanted, never!",
      "I suppose we shall have plenty\nof lamentations now I see we shall but they can t keep me from my\nnarrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I m bound before spring\nis over!",
      "There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the\nchapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please\nyourself whether you go to them or come to me!",
      "Catherine, what have you done?",
      "commenced the master.",
      "Am I nothing to\nyou any more?",
      "Do you love that wretch Heath \n\n Hush!",
      "cried Mrs. Linton.",
      "Hush, this moment!",
      "You mention that name\nand I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!",
      "What you\ntouch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top\nbefore you lay hands on me again.",
      "I don t want you, Edgar: I m past\nwanting you.",
      "Return to your books.",
      "I m glad you possess a consolation,\nfor all you had in me is gone.",
      "Her mind wanders, sir,  I interposed.",
      "She has been talking nonsense\nthe whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and\nshe ll rally.",
      "Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.",
      "I desire no further advice from you,  answered Mr. Linton.",
      "You knew\nyour mistress s nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.",
      "And not to\ngive me one hint of how she has been these three days!",
      "It was\nheartless!",
      "Months of sickness could not cause such a change!",
      "I began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for\nanother s wicked waywardness.",
      "I knew Mrs. Linton s nature to be\nheadstrong and domineering,  cried I:  but I didn t know that you\nwished to foster her fierce temper!",
      "I didn t know that, to humour her,\nI should wink at Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "I performed the duty of a faithful\nservant in telling you, and I have got a faithful servant s wages!",
      "Well, it will teach me to be careful next time.",
      "Next time you may\ngather intelligence for yourself!",
      "The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen\nDean,  he replied.",
      "You d rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?",
      "said\nI.  Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to\ndrop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison\nthe mistress against you?",
      "Confused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our\nconversation.",
      "Ah!",
      "Nelly has played traitor,  she exclaimed, passionately.",
      "Nelly is\nmy hidden enemy.",
      "You witch!",
      "So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!",
      "Let me\ngo, and I ll make her rue!",
      "I ll make her howl a recantation!",
      "A maniac s fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to\ndisengage herself from Linton s arms.",
      "I felt no inclination to tarry\nthe event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility,\nI quitted the chamber.",
      "In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook\nis driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,\nevidently by another agent than the wind.",
      "Notwithstanding my hurry, I\nstayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction\nimpressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.",
      "My surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more\nthan vision, Miss Isabella s springer, Fanny, suspended by a\nhandkerchief, and nearly at its last gasp.",
      "I quickly released the\nanimal, and lifted it into the garden.",
      "I had seen it follow its\nmistress upstairs when she went to bed; and wondered much how it could\nhave got out there, and what mischievous person had treated it so.",
      "While untying the knot round the hook, it seemed to me that I\nrepeatedly caught the beat of horses  feet galloping at some distance;\nbut there were such a number of things to occupy my reflections that I\nhardly gave the circumstance a thought: though it was a strange sound,\nin that place, at two o clock in the morning.",
      "Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a\npatient in the village as I came up the street; and my account of\nCatherine Linton s malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.",
      "He was a plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of\nher surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to\nhis directions than she had shown herself before.",
      "Nelly Dean,  said he,  I can t help fancying there s an extra cause\nfor this.",
      "What has there been to do at the Grange?",
      "We ve odd reports up\nhere.",
      "A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a\ntrifle; and that sort of people should not either.",
      "It s hard work\nbringing them through fevers, and such things.",
      "How did it begin?",
      "The master will inform you,  I answered;  but you are acquainted with\nthe Earnshaws  violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.",
      "I\nmay say this; it commenced in a quarrel.",
      "She was struck during a\ntempest of passion with a kind of fit.",
      "That s her account, at least:\nfor she flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.",
      "Afterwards, she refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and\nremains in a half dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind\nfilled with all sorts of strange ideas and illusions.",
      "Mr. Linton will be sorry?",
      "observed Kenneth, interrogatively.",
      "Sorry?",
      "he ll break his heart should anything happen!",
      "I replied.",
      "Don t alarm him more than necessary.",
      "Well, I told him to beware,  said my companion;  and he must bide the\nconsequences of neglecting my warning!",
      "Hasn t he been intimate with Mr.\nHeathcliff lately?",
      "Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,  answered I,  though more\non the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than\nbecause the master likes his company.",
      "At present he s discharged from\nthe trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after\nMiss Linton which he manifested.",
      "I hardly think he ll be taken in\nagain.",
      "And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?",
      "was the doctor s\nnext question.",
      "I m not in her confidence,  returned I, reluctant to continue the\nsubject.",
      "No, she s a sly one,  he remarked, shaking his head.",
      "She keeps her\nown counsel!",
      "But she s a real little fool.",
      "I have it from good\nauthority that last night (and a pretty night it was!)",
      "she and\nHeathcliff were walking in the plantation at the back of your house\nabove two hours; and he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount\nhis horse and away with him!",
      "My informant said she could only put him\noff by pledging her word of honour to be prepared on their first\nmeeting after that: when it was to be he didn t hear; but you urge Mr.\nLinton to look sharp!",
      "This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran\nmost of the way back.",
      "The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.",
      "I\nspared a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the\nhouse door, it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have\nescaped to the road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.",
      "On\nascending to Isabella s room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was\nempty.",
      "Had I been a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton s illness might have\narrested her rash step.",
      "But what could be done now?",
      "There was a bare\npossibility of overtaking them if pursued instantly.",
      "_I_ could not\npursue them, however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the\nplace with confusion; still less unfold the business to my master,\nabsorbed as he was in his present calamity, and having no heart to\nspare for a second grief!",
      "I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue,\nand suffer matters to take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I\nwent with a badly composed countenance to announce him.",
      "Catherine lay\nin a troubled sleep: her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess\nof frenzy; he now hung over her pillow, watching every shade and every\nchange of her painfully expressive features.",
      "The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him\nof its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve\naround her perfect and constant tranquillity.",
      "To me, he signified the\nthreatening danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of\nintellect.",
      "I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we\nnever went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual\nhour, moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging\nwhispers as they encountered each other in their vocations.",
      "Every one\nwas active but Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she\nslept: her brother, too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient\nfor her presence, and hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her\nsister-in-law.",
      "I trembled lest he should send me to call her; but I was\nspared the pain of being the first proclaimant of her flight.",
      "One of\nthe maids, a thoughtless girl, who had been on an early errand to\nGimmerton, came panting upstairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the\nchamber, crying:  Oh, dear, dear!",
      "What mun we have next?",
      "Master,\nmaster, our young lady \n\n Hold your noise!",
      "cried I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.",
      "Speak lower, Mary What is the matter?",
      "said Mr. Linton.",
      "What ails\nyour young lady?",
      "She s gone, she s gone!",
      "Yon  Heathcliff s run off wi  her!",
      "gasped the\ngirl.",
      "That is not true!",
      "exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.",
      "It cannot\nbe: how has the idea entered your head?",
      "Ellen Dean, go and seek her.",
      "It\nis incredible: it cannot be.",
      "As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his\ndemand to know her reasons for such an assertion.",
      "Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,  she stammered,\n and he asked whether we weren t in trouble at the Grange.",
      "I thought he\nmeant for missis s sickness, so I answered, yes.",
      "Then says he,  There s\nsomebody gone after  em, I guess?",
      "I stared.",
      "He saw I knew nought about\nit, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse s\nshoe fastened at a blacksmith s shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not\nvery long after midnight!",
      "and how the blacksmith s lass had got up to\nspy who they were: she knew them both directly.",
      "And she noticed the\nman Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob dy could mistake him,\nbesides put a sovereign in her father s hand for payment.",
      "The lady had\na cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she\ndrank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.",
      "Heathcliff held both\nbridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and\nwent as fast as the rough roads would let them.",
      "The lass said nothing\nto her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.",
      "I ran and peeped, for form s sake, into Isabella s room; confirming,\nwhen I returned, the servant s statement.",
      "Mr. Linton had resumed his\nseat by the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the\nmeaning of my blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order,\nor uttering a word.",
      "Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,  I\ninquired.",
      "How should we do?",
      "She went of her own accord,  answered the master;  she had a right to\ngo if she pleased.",
      "Trouble me no more about her.",
      "Hereafter she is only\nmy sister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has\ndisowned me.",
      "And that was all he said on the subject: he did not make a single inquiry\nfurther, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what\nproperty she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when\nI knew it.",
      "CHAPTER XIII\n\n\nFor two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\nLinton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was\ndenominated a brain fever.",
      "No mother could have nursed an only child\nmore devotedly than Edgar tended her.",
      "Day and night he was watching,\nand patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a\nshaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he\nsaved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the\nsource of constant future anxiety in fact, that his health and strength\nwere being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity he knew no\nlimits in gratitude and joy when Catherine s life was declared out of\ndanger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the\ngradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes\nwith the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance\nalso, and she would soon be entirely her former self.",
      "The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\nfollowing March.",
      "Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\nhandful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\npleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered\nthem eagerly together.",
      "These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,  she exclaimed.",
      "They\nremind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted\nsnow.",
      "Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost\ngone?",
      "The snow is quite gone down here, darling,  replied her husband;  and\nI only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is\nblue, and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim\nfull.",
      "Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you\nunder this roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the\nair blows so sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.",
      "I shall never be there but once more,  said the invalid;  and then\nyou ll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.",
      "Next spring you ll long\nagain to have me under this roof, and you ll look back and think you\nwere happy to-day.",
      "Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\nthe fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the\ntears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.",
      "We\nknew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long\nconfinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it\nmight be partially removed by a change of scene.",
      "The master told me to\nlight a fire in the many-weeks  deserted parlour, and to set an\neasy-chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down,\nand she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected,\nrevived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free\nfrom the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber.",
      "By\nevening she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade\nher to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa\nfor her bed, till another room could be prepared.",
      "To obviate the\nfatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where\nyou lie at present on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon\nstrong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar s arm.",
      "Ah, I thought myself, she might recover, so waited on as she was.",
      "And\nthere was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that\nof another: we cherished the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton s\nheart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger s\ngripe, by the birth of an heir.",
      "I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\nher departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.",
      "It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil\nan obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and\nreconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she\ncould not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal\nit.",
      "Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more,\nI got a long letter, which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a\nbride just out of the honeymoon.",
      "I ll read it: for I keep it yet.",
      "Any\nrelic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nDEAR ELLEN, it begins, I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\nheard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very\nill.",
      "I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too\nangry or too distressed to answer what I sent him.",
      "Still, I must write\nto somebody, and the only choice left me is you.",
      "Inform Edgar that I d give the world to see his face again that my\nheart returned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left\nit, and is there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and\nCatherine!",
      "_I can t follow it though_ (these words are underlined) they\nneed not expect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please;\ntaking care, however, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or\ndeficient affection.",
      "The remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.",
      "I want to ask you\ntwo questions: the first is, How did you contrive to preserve the\ncommon sympathies of human nature when you resided here?",
      "I cannot\nrecognise any sentiment which those around share with me.",
      "The second question I have great interest in; it is this Is Mr.\nHeathcliff a man?",
      "If so, is he mad?",
      "And if not, is he a devil?",
      "I\nsha n t tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\nexplain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\nme; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.",
      "Don t write, but come, and\nbring me something from Edgar.",
      "Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am\nled to imagine the Heights will be.",
      "It is to amuse myself that I dwell\non such subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\nthoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.",
      "I should laugh and\ndance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries,\nand the rest was an unnatural dream!",
      "The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\njudged it to be six o clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\ninspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\nwell as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard\nof the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\nreceive us by the light of a dip candle.",
      "He did it with a courtesy that\nredounded to his credit.",
      "His first act was to elevate his torch to a\nlevel with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\naway.",
      "Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\nreappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived\nin an ancient castle.",
      "Heathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen a dingy,\nuntidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\nwas in your charge.",
      "By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\nand dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\nmouth.",
      "This is Edgar s legal nephew,  I reflected mine in a manner; I must\nshake hands, and yes I must kiss him.",
      "It is right to establish a good\nunderstanding at the beginning.",
      "I approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said How do you\ndo, my dear?",
      "He replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.",
      "Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?",
      "was my next essay at\nconversation.",
      "An oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not  frame off \nrewarded my perseverance.",
      "Hey, Throttler, lad!",
      "whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred\nbull-dog from its lair in a corner.",
      "Now, wilt thou be ganging?",
      "he\nasked authoritatively.",
      "Love for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to\nwait till the others should enter.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible;\nand Joseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany\nme in, after staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\nreplied Mim!",
      "mim!",
      "mim!",
      "Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?",
      "Mincing un  munching!",
      "How can I tell whet ye say?",
      "I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!",
      "I cried, thinking\nhim deaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.",
      "None o  me!",
      "I getten summut else to do,  he answered, and continued\nhis work; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\ncountenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I m\nsure, as sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.",
      "I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at\nwhich I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant\nmight show himself.",
      "After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall,\ngaunt man, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his\nfeatures were lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders;\nand _his_ eyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine s with all their\nbeauty annihilated.",
      "What s your business here?",
      "he demanded, grimly.",
      "Who are you?",
      "My name _was_ Isabella Linton,  I replied.",
      "You ve seen me before,\nsir.",
      "I m lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here I\nsuppose by your permission.",
      "Is he come back, then?",
      "asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.",
      "Yes we came just now,  I said;  but he left me by the kitchen door;\nand when I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\nplace, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.",
      "It s well the hellish villain has kept his word!",
      "growled my future\nhost, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\nHeathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\nthreats of what he would have done had the  fiend  deceived him.",
      "I repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined\nto slip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\nintention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.",
      "There\nwas a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment,\nwhose floor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant\npewter-dishes, which used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook\nof a similar obscurity, created by tarnish and dust.",
      "I inquired whether\nI might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!",
      "Mr. Earnshaw\nvouchsafed no answer.",
      "He walked up and down, with his hands in his\npockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction\nwas evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I\nshrank from disturbing him again.",
      "You ll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\nseated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\nremembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\nthe only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\nAtlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\nthem!",
      "I questioned with myself where must I turn for comfort?",
      "and mind\nyou don t tell Edgar, or Catherine above every sorrow beside, this rose\npre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\nagainst Heathcliff!",
      "I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\ngladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone\nwith him; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not\nfear their intermeddling.",
      "I sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\nstill my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\nperfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\nout at intervals.",
      "I listened to detect a woman s voice in the house,\nand filled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations,\nwhich, at last, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.",
      "I\nwas not aware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in\nhis measured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.",
      "Taking advantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed I m tired\nwith my journey, and I want to go to bed!",
      "Where is the maid-servant?",
      "Direct me to her, as she won t come to me!",
      "We have none,  he answered;  you must wait on yourself!",
      "Where must I sleep, then?",
      "I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\nself-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.",
      "Joseph will show you Heathcliff s chamber,  said he;  open that\ndoor he s in there.",
      "I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\nstrangest tone Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\nbolt don t omit it!",
      "Well!",
      "I said.",
      "But why, Mr. Earnshaw?",
      "I did not relish the notion of\ndeliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.",
      "Look here!",
      "he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\ncuriously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife\nattached to the barrel.",
      "That s a great tempter to a desperate man, is\nit not?",
      "I cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his\ndoor.",
      "If once I find it open he s done for; I do it invariably, even\nthough the minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that\nshould make me refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own\nschemes by killing him.",
      "You fight against that devil for love as long\nas you may; when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall\nsave him!",
      "I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.",
      "A hideous notion struck me: how\npowerful I should be possessing such an instrument!",
      "I took it from his\nhand, and touched the blade.",
      "He looked astonished at the expression my\nface assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\ncovetousness.",
      "He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\nand returned it to its concealment.",
      "I don t care if you tell him,  said he.",
      "Put him on his guard, and\nwatch for him.",
      "You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\nshock you.",
      "What has Heathcliff done to you?",
      "I asked.",
      "In what has he wronged\nyou, to warrant this appalling hatred?",
      "Wouldn t it be wiser to bid him\nquit the house?",
      "No!",
      "thundered Earnshaw;  should he offer to leave me, he s a dead\nman: persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!",
      "Am I to lose\n_all_, without a chance of retrieval?",
      "Is Hareton to be a beggar?",
      "Oh,\ndamnation!",
      "I _will_ have it back; and I ll have _his_ gold too; and\nthen his blood; and hell shall have his soul!",
      "It will be ten times\nblacker with that guest than ever it was before!",
      "You ve acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master s habits.",
      "He is\nclearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.",
      "I\nshuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant s ill-bred\nmoroseness as comparatively agreeable.",
      "He now recommenced his moody\nwalk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.",
      "Joseph was\nbending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it;\nand a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.",
      "The contents\nof the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the\nbowl; I conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper,\nand, being hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out\nsharply,  _I ll_ make the porridge!",
      "I removed the vessel out of his\nreach, and proceeded to take off my hat and riding-habit.",
      "Mr.\nEarnshaw,  I continued,  directs me to wait on myself: I will.",
      "I m not\ngoing to act the lady among you, for fear I should starve.",
      "Gooid Lord!",
      "he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\nstockings from the knee to the ankle.",
      "If there s to be fresh\northerings just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev  a\n_mistress_ set o er my heead, it s like time to be flitting.",
      "I niver\n_did_ think to see t  day that I mud lave th  owld place but I doubt\nit s nigh at hand!",
      "This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work,\nsighing to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but\ncompelled speedily to drive off the remembrance.",
      "It racked me to recall\npast happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its\napparition, the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the\nhandfuls of meal fell into the water.",
      "Joseph beheld my style of cookery\nwith growing indignation.",
      "Thear!",
      "he ejaculated.",
      "Hareton, thou willn t sup thy porridge\nto-neeght; they ll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.",
      "Thear,\nagean!",
      "I d fling in bowl un  all, if I wer ye!",
      "There, pale t  guilp\noff, un  then ye ll hae done wi t. Bang, bang.",
      "It s a mercy t  bothom\nisn t deaved out!",
      "It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\nhad been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from\nthe dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling\nfrom the expansive lip.",
      "I expostulated, and desired that he should have\nhis in a mug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so\ndirtily.",
      "The old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety;\nassuring me, repeatedly, that  the barn was every bit as good  as I,\n and every bit as wollsome,  and wondering how I could fashion to be so\nconceited.",
      "Meanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and\nglowered up at me defyingly, as he slavered into the jug.",
      "I shall have my supper in another room,  I said.",
      "Have you no place\nyou call a parlour?",
      "_Parlour_!",
      "he echoed, sneeringly,  _parlour_!",
      "Nay, we ve noa\n_parlours_.",
      "If yah dunnut loike wer company, there s maister s; un  if\nyah dunnut loike maister, there s us.",
      "Then I shall go upstairs,  I answered;  show me a chamber.",
      "I put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.",
      "With\ngreat grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\nmounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into\nthe apartments we passed.",
      "Here s a rahm,  he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\nhinges.",
      "It s weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.",
      "There s a pack o \ncorn i  t  corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye re feared o  muckying\nyer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o  t  top on t. \n\nThe  rahm  was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\nvarious sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\nspace in the middle.",
      "Why, man,  I exclaimed, facing him angrily,  this is not a place to\nsleep in.",
      "I wish to see my bed-room.",
      "_Bed-rume_!",
      "he repeated, in a tone of mockery.",
      "Yah s see all t \n_bed-rumes_ thear is yon s mine.",
      "He pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in\nbeing more naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless\nbed, with an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.",
      "What do I want with yours?",
      "I retorted.",
      "I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\nnot lodge at the top of the house, does he?",
      "Oh!",
      "it s Maister _Hathecliff s_ ye re wanting?",
      "cried he, as if making\na new discovery.",
      "Couldn t ye ha  said soa, at onst?",
      "un  then, I mud\nha  telled ye, baht all this wark, that that s just one ye cannut\nsee he allas keeps it locked, un  nob dy iver mells on t but hisseln.",
      "You ve a nice house, Joseph,  I could not refrain from observing,  and\npleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the\nmadness in the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my\nfate with theirs!",
      "However, that is not to the present purpose there are\nother rooms.",
      "For heaven s sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!",
      "He made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\nwooden steps, and halting before an apartment which, from that halt\nand the superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best\none.",
      "There was a carpet a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by\ndust; a fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\noak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material\nand modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\nvallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\nsupporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\ntrail upon the floor.",
      "The chairs were also damaged, many of them\nseverely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.",
      "I was\nendeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\nwhen my fool of a guide announced, This here is t  maister s.  My\nsupper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\nexhausted.",
      "I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\nrefuge, and means of repose.",
      "Whear the divil?",
      "began the religious elder.",
      "The Lord bless us!",
      "The\nLord forgie us!",
      "Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang?",
      "ye marred, wearisome\nnowt!",
      "Ye ve seen all but Hareton s bit of a cham er.",
      "There s not\nanother hoile to lig down in i  th  hahse!",
      "I was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and\nthen seated myself at the stairs -head, hid my face in my hands, and\ncried.",
      "Ech!",
      "ech!",
      "exclaimed Joseph.",
      "Weel done, Miss Cathy!",
      "weel done, Miss\nCathy!",
      "Howsiver, t  maister sall just tum le o er them brocken pots;\nun  then we s hear summut; we s hear how it s to be.",
      "Gooid-for-naught\nmadling!",
      "ye desarve pining fro  this to Churstmas, flinging t  precious\ngifts uh God under fooit i  yer flaysome rages!",
      "But I m mista en if ye\nshew yer sperrit lang.",
      "Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye?",
      "I nobbut wish he may catch ye i  that plisky.",
      "I nobbut wish he may.",
      "And so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with\nhim; and I remained in the dark.",
      "The period of reflection succeeding\nthis silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\npride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its\neffects.",
      "An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of\nThrottler, whom I now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had\nspent its whelphood at the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr.\nHindley.",
      "I fancy it knew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of\nsalute, and then hastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from\nstep to step, collecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the\nspatters of milk from the banister with my pocket-handkerchief.",
      "Our\nlabours were scarcely over when I heard Earnshaw s tread in the\npassage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and pressed to the wall; I\nstole into the nearest doorway.",
      "The dog s endeavour to avoid him was\nunsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter downstairs, and a prolonged,\npiteous yelping.",
      "I had better luck: he passed on, entered his chamber,\nand shut the door.",
      "Directly after Joseph came up with Hareton, to put\nhim to bed.",
      "I had found shelter in Hareton s room, and the old man, on\nseeing me, said, They s rahm for boath ye un  yer pride, now, I sud\nthink i  the hahse.",
      "It s empty; ye may hev  it all to yerseln, un  Him\nas allas maks a third, i  sich ill company!",
      "Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\nmyself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.",
      "My slumber was\ndeep and sweet, though over far too soon.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\nhad just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\nthere?",
      "I told him the cause of my staying up so late that he had the\nkey of our room in his pocket.",
      "The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.",
      "He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he d but I ll not\nrepeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\nand unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!",
      "I sometimes wonder at\nhim with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger\nor a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which\nhe wakens.",
      "He told me of Catherine s illness, and accused my brother of\ncausing it; promising that I should be Edgar s proxy in suffering, till\nhe could get hold of him.",
      "I do hate him I am wretched I have been a fool!",
      "Beware of uttering one\nbreath of this to any one at the Grange.",
      "I shall expect you every\nday don t disappoint me!",
      "ISABELLA.",
      "CHAPTER XIV\n\n\nAs soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and\ninformed him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a\nletter expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton s situation, and her\nardent desire to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as\nearly as possible, some token of forgiveness by me.",
      "Forgiveness!",
      "said Linton.",
      "I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.",
      "You\nmay call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that\nI am not _angry_, but I m _sorry_ to have lost her; especially as I can\nnever think she ll be happy.",
      "It is out of the question my going to see\nher, however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to\noblige me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the\ncountry.",
      "And you won t write her a little note, sir?",
      "I asked, imploringly.",
      "No,  he answered.",
      "It is needless.",
      "My communication with Heathcliff s\nfamily shall be as sparing as his with mine.",
      "It shall not exist!",
      "Mr. Edgar s coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\nGrange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said,\nwhen I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines\nto console Isabella.",
      "I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\nmorning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\ncauseway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\nobserved.",
      "I entered without knocking.",
      "There never was such a dreary,\ndismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented!",
      "I must confess,\nthat if I had been in the young lady s place, I would, at least, have\nswept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster.",
      "But she already\npartook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.",
      "Her\npretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\nlankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head.",
      "Probably she\nhad not touched her dress since yester evening.",
      "Hindley was not there.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\npocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\nfriendly, and offered me a chair.",
      "He was the only thing there that\nseemed decent; and I thought he never looked better.",
      "So much had\ncircumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\nstruck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\nthorough little slattern!",
      "She came forward eagerly to greet me, and\nheld out one hand to take the expected letter.",
      "I shook my head.",
      "She\nwouldn t understand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I\nwent to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her\ndirectly what I had brought.",
      "Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her\nman uvres, and said If you have got anything for Isabella (as no\ndoubt you have, Nelly), give it to her.",
      "You needn t make a secret of\nit: we have no secrets between us.",
      "Oh, I have nothing,  I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\nonce.",
      "My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\na letter or a visit from him at present.",
      "He sends his love, ma am, and\nhis wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\noccasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\nhousehold here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\nkeeping it up.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff s lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat\nin the window.",
      "Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me,\nand began to put questions concerning Catherine.",
      "I told him as much as\nI thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\ncross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.",
      "I\nblamed her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended\nby hoping that he would follow Mr. Linton s example and avoid future\ninterference with his family, for good or evil.",
      "Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,  I said;  she ll never be like she\nwas, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\nyou ll shun crossing her way again: nay, you ll move out of this\ncountry entirely; and that you may not regret it, I ll inform you\nCatherine Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine\nEarnshaw, as that young lady is different from me.",
      "Her appearance is\nchanged greatly, her character much more so; and the person who is\ncompelled, of necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his\naffection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was, by common\nhumanity, and a sense of duty!",
      "That is quite possible,  remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\ncalm:  quite possible that your master should have nothing but common\nhumanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.",
      "But do you imagine that\nI shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_?",
      "and can you\ncompare my feelings respecting Catherine to his?",
      "Before you leave this\nhouse, I must exact a promise from you that you ll get me an interview\nwith her: consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!",
      "What do you say?",
      "I say, Mr. Heathcliff,  I replied,  you must not: you never shall,\nthrough my means.",
      "Another encounter between you and the master would\nkill her altogether.",
      "With your aid that may be avoided,  he continued;  and should there be\ndanger of such an event should he be the cause of adding a single\ntrouble more to her existence why, I think I shall be justified in\ngoing to extremes!",
      "I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\nCatherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\nrestrains me.",
      "And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\nhad he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\nthat turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\nhim.",
      "You may look incredulous, if you please!",
      "I never would have\nbanished him from her society as long as she desired his.",
      "The moment\nher regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his\nblood!",
      "But, till then if you don t believe me, you don t know me till\nthen, I would have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his\nhead!",
      "And yet,  I interrupted,  you have no scruples in completely ruining\nall hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\nremembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her\nin a new tumult of discord and distress.",
      "You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?",
      "he said.",
      "Oh, Nelly!",
      "you\nknow she has not!",
      "You know as well as I do, that for every thought she\nspends on Linton she spends a thousand on me!",
      "At a most miserable\nperiod of my life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my\nreturn to the neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance\ncould make me admit the horrible idea again.",
      "And then, Linton would be\nnothing, nor Hindley, nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.",
      "Two words\nwould comprehend my future _death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing\nher, would be hell.",
      "Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she\nvalued Edgar Linton s attachment more than mine.",
      "If he loved with all\nthe powers of his puny being, he couldn t love as much in eighty years\nas I could in a day.",
      "And Catherine has a heart as deep as I have: the\nsea could be as readily contained in that horse-trough as her whole\naffection be monopolised by him.",
      "Tush!",
      "He is scarcely a degree dearer\nto her than her dog, or her horse.",
      "It is not in him to be loved like\nme: how can she love in him what he has not?",
      "Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can\nbe,  cried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.",
      "No one has a right to talk\nin that manner, and I won t hear my brother depreciated in silence!",
      "Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn t he?",
      "observed\nHeathcliff, scornfully.",
      "He turns you adrift on the world with\nsurprising alacrity.",
      "He is not aware of what I suffer,  she replied.",
      "I didn t tell him\nthat.",
      "You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have\nyou?",
      "To say that I was married, I did write you saw the note.",
      "And nothing since?",
      "No.",
      "My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition, \nI remarked.",
      "Somebody s love comes short in her case, obviously; whose,\nI may guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn t say.",
      "I should guess it was her own,  said Heathcliff.",
      "She degenerates into\na mere slut!",
      "She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.",
      "You d hardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was\nweeping to go home.",
      "However, she ll suit this house so much the better\nfor not being over nice, and I ll take care she does not disgrace me by\nrambling abroad.",
      "Well, sir,  returned I,  I hope you ll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff\nis accustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\nbrought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.",
      "You must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you\nmust treat her kindly.",
      "Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot\ndoubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn t\nhave abandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former\nhome, to fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.",
      "She abandoned them under a delusion,  he answered;  picturing in me a\nhero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\ndevotion.",
      "I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\nso obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\ncharacter and acting on the false impressions she cherished.",
      "But, at\nlast, I think she begins to know me: I don t perceive the silly smiles\nand grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability\nof discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\ninfatuation and herself.",
      "It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\ndiscover that I did not love her.",
      "I believed, at one time, no lessons\ncould teach her that!",
      "And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\nannounced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\nsucceeded in making her hate me!",
      "A positive labour of Hercules, I\nassure you!",
      "If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.",
      "Can I\ntrust your assertion, Isabella?",
      "Are you sure you hate me?",
      "If I let you\nalone for half a day, won t you come sighing and wheedling to me again?",
      "I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it\nwounds her vanity to have the truth exposed.",
      "But I don t care who knows\nthat the passion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie\nabout it.",
      "She cannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful\nsoftness.",
      "The first thing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange,\nwas to hang up her little dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first\nwords I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being\nbelonging to her, except one: possibly she took that exception for\nherself.",
      "But no brutality disgusted her: I suppose she has an innate\nadmiration of it, if only her precious person were secure from injury!",
      "Now, was it not the depth of absurdity of genuine idiocy, for that\npitiful, slavish, mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her?",
      "Tell your master, Nelly, that I never, in all my life, met with such an\nabject thing as she is.",
      "She even disgraces the name of Linton; and I ve\nsometimes relented, from pure lack of invention, in my experiments on\nwhat she could endure, and still creep shamefully cringing back!",
      "But\ntell him, also, to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease:\nthat I keep strictly within the limits of the law.",
      "I have avoided, up\nto this period, giving her the slightest right to claim a separation;\nand, what s more, she d thank nobody for dividing us.",
      "If she desired to\ngo, she might: the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification\nto be derived from tormenting her!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff,  said I,  this is the talk of a madman; your wife,\nmost likely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has\nborne with you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she ll\ndoubtless avail herself of the permission.",
      "You are not so bewitched,\nma am, are you, as to remain with him of your own accord?",
      "Take care, Ellen!",
      "answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully;\nthere was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her\npartner s endeavours to make himself detested.",
      "Don t put faith in a\nsingle word he speaks.",
      "He s a lying fiend!",
      "a monster, and not a human\nbeing!",
      "I ve been told I might leave him before; and I ve made the\nattempt, but I dare not repeat it!",
      "Only, Ellen, promise you ll not\nmention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or\nCatherine.",
      "Whatever he may pretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to\ndesperation: he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over\nhim; and he sha n t obtain it I ll die first!",
      "I just hope, I pray, that\nhe may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me!",
      "The single pleasure\nI can imagine is to die, or to see him dead!",
      "There that will do for the present!",
      "said Heathcliff.",
      "If you are\ncalled upon in a court of law, you ll remember her language, Nelly!",
      "And\ntake a good look at that countenance: she s near the point which would\nsuit me.",
      "No; you re not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\nI, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\ndistasteful the obligation may be.",
      "Go upstairs; I have something to say\nto Ellen Dean in private.",
      "That s not the way: upstairs, I tell you!",
      "Why, this is the road upstairs, child!",
      "He seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering I have\nno pity!",
      "I have no pity!",
      "The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\ncrush out their entrails!",
      "It is a moral teething; and I grind with\ngreater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.",
      "Do you understand what the word pity means?",
      "I said, hastening to\nresume my bonnet.",
      "Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?",
      "Put that down!",
      "he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.",
      "You are not going yet.",
      "Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\ncompel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine,\nand that without delay.",
      "I swear that I meditate no harm: I don t desire\nto cause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only\nwish to hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to\nask if anything that I could do would be of use to her.",
      "Last night I\nwas in the Grange garden six hours, and I ll return there to-night; and\nevery night I ll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an\nopportunity of entering.",
      "If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate\nto knock him down, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I\nstay.",
      "If his servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these\npistols.",
      "But wouldn t it be better to prevent my coming in contact with\nthem, or their master?",
      "And you could do it so easily.",
      "I d warn you when\nI came, and then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was\nalone, and watch till I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would\nbe hindering mischief.",
      "I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer s\nhouse: and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his\ndestroying Mrs. Linton s tranquillity for his satisfaction.",
      "The\ncommonest occurrence startles her painfully,  I said.",
      "She s all\nnerves, and she couldn t bear the surprise, I m positive.",
      "Don t\npersist, sir!",
      "or else I shall be obliged to inform my master of your\ndesigns; and he ll take measures to secure his house and its inmates\nfrom any such unwarrantable intrusions!",
      "In that case I ll take measures to secure you, woman!",
      "exclaimed\nHeathcliff;  you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow\nmorning.",
      "It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear\nto see me; and as to surprising her, I don t desire it: you must\nprepare her ask her if I may come.",
      "You say she never mentions my name,\nand that I am never mentioned to her.",
      "To whom should she mention me if\nI am a forbidden topic in the house?",
      "She thinks you are all spies for\nher husband.",
      "Oh, I ve no doubt she s in hell among you!",
      "I guess by her\nsilence, as much as anything, what she feels.",
      "You say she is often\nrestless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?",
      "You\ntalk of her mind being unsettled.",
      "How the devil could it be otherwise\nin her frightful isolation?",
      "And that insipid, paltry creature attending\nher from _duty_ and _humanity_!",
      "From _pity_ and _charity_!",
      "He might as\nwell plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine\nhe can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares!",
      "Let us\nsettle it at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to\nCatherine over Linton and his footman?",
      "Or will you be my friend, as you\nhave been hitherto, and do what I request?",
      "Decide!",
      "because there is no\nreason for my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn\nill-nature!",
      "Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him\nfifty times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.",
      "I\nengaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she\nconsent, I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton s next\nabsence from home, when he might come, and get in as he was able: I\nwouldn t be there, and my fellow-servants should be equally out of the\nway.",
      "Was it right or wrong?",
      "I fear it was wrong, though expedient.",
      "I\nthought I prevented another explosion by my compliance; and I thought,\ntoo, it might create a favourable crisis in Catherine s mental illness:\nand then I remembered Mr. Edgar s stern rebuke of my carrying tales;\nand I tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject, by\naffirming, with frequent iteration, that that betrayal of trust, if it\nmerited so harsh an appellation, should be the last.",
      "Notwithstanding,\nmy journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither; and many\nmisgivings I had, ere I could prevail on myself to put the missive into\nMrs. Linton s hand.",
      "But here is Kenneth; I ll go down, and tell him how much better you\nare.",
      "My history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away\nanother morning.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nDree, and dreary!",
      "I reflected as the good woman descended to receive\nthe doctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to\namuse me.",
      "But never mind!",
      "I ll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs.\nDean s bitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that\nlurks in Catherine Heathcliff s brilliant eyes.",
      "I should be in a\ncurious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the\ndaughter turned out a second edition of the mother.",
      "CHAPTER XV\n\n\nAnother week over and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!",
      "I\nhave now heard all my neighbour s history, at different sittings, as\nthe housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.",
      "I ll\ncontinue it in her own words, only a little condensed.",
      "She is, on the\nwhole, a very fair narrator, and I don t think I could improve her\nstyle.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nIn the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I\nknew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place;\nand I shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my\npocket, and didn t want to be threatened or teased any more.",
      "I had made\nup my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not\nguess how its receipt would affect Catherine.",
      "The consequence was, that\nit did not reach her before the lapse of three days.",
      "The fourth was\nSunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to\nchurch.",
      "There was a man servant left to keep the house with me, and we\ngenerally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of\nservice; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that\nI set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would\nbe coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for\nsome oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be\npaid for on the morrow.",
      "He departed, and I went upstairs.",
      "Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her\nshoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.",
      "Her thick, long\nhair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now\nshe wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and\nneck.",
      "Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when\nshe was calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.",
      "The flash of\nher eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they\nno longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her:\nthey appeared always to gaze beyond, and far beyond you would have said\nout of this world.",
      "Then, the paleness of her face its haggard aspect\nhaving vanished as she recovered flesh and the peculiar expression\narising from her mental state, though painfully suggestive of their\ncauses, added to the touching interest which she awakened;\nand invariably to me, I know, and to any person who saw her, I should\nthink refuted more tangible proofs of convalescence, and stamped her as\none doomed to decay.",
      "A book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible\nwind fluttered its leaves at intervals.",
      "I believe Linton had laid it\nthere: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or\noccupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to\nentice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her\namusement.",
      "She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods\nendured his efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and\nthen suppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the\nsaddest of smiles and kisses.",
      "At other times, she would turn petulantly\naway, and hide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and\nthen he took care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no\ngood.",
      "Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of\nthe beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.",
      "It was a sweet\nsubstitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which\ndrowned that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.",
      "At\nWuthering Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great\nthaw or a season of steady rain.",
      "And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was\nthinking as she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all;\nbut she had the vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed\nno recognition of material things either by ear or eye.",
      "There s a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,  I said, gently inserting it in\none hand that rested on her knee.",
      "You must read it immediately,\nbecause it wants an answer.",
      "Shall I break the seal?",
      "Yes,  she\nanswered, without altering the direction of her eyes.",
      "I opened it it\nwas very short.",
      "Now,  I continued,  read it.",
      "She drew away her hand,\nand let it fall.",
      "I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it\nshould please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed\nthat at last I resumed Must I read it, ma am?",
      "It is from Mr.\nHeathcliff.",
      "There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle\nto arrange her ideas.",
      "She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it;\nand when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she\nhad not gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply,\nshe merely pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and\nquestioning eagerness.",
      "Well, he wishes to see you,  said I, guessing her need of an\ninterpreter.",
      "He s in the garden by this time, and impatient to know\nwhat answer I shall bring.",
      "As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath\nraise its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back,\nannounce, by a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did\nnot consider a stranger.",
      "Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened\nbreathlessly.",
      "The minute after a step traversed the hall; the open\nhouse was too tempting for Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely\nhe supposed that I was inclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to\ntrust to his own audacity.",
      "With straining eagerness Catherine gazed\ntowards the entrance of her chamber.",
      "He did not hit the right room\ndirectly: she motioned me to admit him, but he found it out ere I could\nreach the door, and in a stride or two was at her side, and had her\ngrasped in his arms.",
      "He neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during\nwhich period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life\nbefore, I daresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I\nplainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look\ninto her face!",
      "The same conviction had stricken him as me, from the\ninstant he beheld her, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery\nthere she was fated, sure to die.",
      "Oh, Cathy!",
      "Oh, my life!",
      "how can I bear it?",
      "was the first sentence he\nuttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.",
      "And now\nhe stared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his\ngaze would bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish:\nthey did not melt.",
      "What now?",
      "said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\nsuddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly\nvarying caprices.",
      "You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!",
      "And\nyou both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be\npitied!",
      "I shall not pity you, not I.",
      "You have killed me and thriven on\nit, I think.",
      "How strong you are!",
      "How many years do you mean to live\nafter I am gone?",
      "Heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,\nbut she seized his hair, and kept him down.",
      "I wish I could hold you,  she continued, bitterly,  till we were both\ndead!",
      "I shouldn t care what you suffered.",
      "I care nothing for your\nsufferings.",
      "Why shouldn t you suffer?",
      "I do!",
      "Will you forget me?",
      "Will\nyou be happy when I am in the earth?",
      "Will you say twenty years hence,\n That s the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?",
      "I loved her long ago, and was\nwretched to lose her; but it is past.",
      "I ve loved many others since: my\nchildren are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not\nrejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave\nthem!",
      "Will you say so, Heathcliff?",
      "Don t torture me till I m as mad as yourself,  cried he, wrenching his\nhead free, and grinding his teeth.",
      "The two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.",
      "Well\nmight Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her,\nunless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.",
      "Her\npresent countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a\nbloodless lip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed\nfingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping.",
      "As to her\ncompanion, while raising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm\nwith the other; and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the\nrequirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four\ndistinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin.",
      "Are you possessed with a devil,  he pursued, savagely,  to talk in\nthat manner to me when you are dying?",
      "Do you reflect that all those\nwords will be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after\nyou have left me?",
      "You know you lie to say I have killed you: and,\nCatherine, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence!",
      "Is\nit not sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at\npeace I shall writhe in the torments of hell?",
      "I shall not be at peace,  moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\nphysical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\nbeat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.",
      "She said\nnothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\nkindly \n\n I m not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.",
      "I only\nwish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\nhereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\nsake, forgive me!",
      "Come here and kneel down again!",
      "You never harmed me\nin your life.",
      "Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\nthan my harsh words!",
      "Won t you come here again?",
      "Do!",
      "Heathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so\nfar as to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.",
      "She bent\nround to look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he\nwalked to the fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards\nus.",
      "Mrs. Linton s glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke\na new sentiment in her.",
      "After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she\nresumed; addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment: \n\n Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\ngrave.",
      "_That_ is how I m loved!",
      "Well, never mind.",
      "That is not _my_\nHeathcliff.",
      "I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he s in my\nsoul.",
      "And,  added she musingly,  the thing that irks me most is this\nshattered prison, after all.",
      "I m tired of being enclosed here.",
      "I m\nwearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there:\nnot seeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the\nwalls of an aching heart: but really with it, and in it.",
      "Nelly, you\nthink you are better and more fortunate than I; in full health and\nstrength: you are sorry for me very soon that will be altered.",
      "I shall\nbe sorry for _you_.",
      "I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.",
      "I\n_wonder_ he won t be near me!",
      "She went on to herself.",
      "I thought he\nwished it.",
      "Heathcliff, dear!",
      "you should not be sullen now.",
      "Do come to\nme, Heathcliff.",
      "In her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the\nchair.",
      "At that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely\ndesperate.",
      "His eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his\nbreast heaved convulsively.",
      "An instant they held asunder, and then how\nthey met I hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her,\nand they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress\nwould never be released alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly\ninsensible.",
      "He flung himself into the nearest seat, and on my\napproaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at\nme, and foamed like a mad dog, and gathered her to him with greedy\njealousy.",
      "I did not feel as if I were in the company of a creature of\nmy own species: it appeared that he would not understand, though I\nspoke to him; so I stood off, and held my tongue, in great perplexity.",
      "A movement of Catherine s relieved me a little presently: she put up\nher hand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her;\nwhile he, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly \n\n You teach me now how cruel you ve been cruel and false.",
      "_Why_ did you\ndespise me?",
      "_Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy?",
      "I have not one\nword of comfort.",
      "You deserve this.",
      "You have killed yourself.",
      "Yes, you\nmay kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they ll blight\nyou they ll damn you.",
      "You loved me then what _right_ had you to leave\nme?",
      "What right answer me for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?",
      "Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or\nSatan could inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did\nit.",
      "I have not broken your heart _you_ have broken it; and in breaking\nit, you have broken mine.",
      "So much the worse for me that I am strong.",
      "Do\nI want to live?",
      "What kind of living will it be when you oh, God!",
      "would\n_you_ like to live with your soul in the grave?",
      "Let me alone.",
      "Let me alone,  sobbed Catherine.",
      "If I ve done wrong,\nI m dying for it.",
      "It is enough!",
      "You left me too: but I won t upbraid\nyou!",
      "I forgive you.",
      "Forgive me!",
      "It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those\nwasted hands,  he answered.",
      "Kiss me again; and don t let me see your\neyes!",
      "I forgive what you have done to me.",
      "I love _my_ murderer but\n_yours_!",
      "How can I?",
      "They were silent their faces hid against each other, and washed by each\nother s tears.",
      "At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it\nseemed Heathcliff _could_ weep on a great occasion like this.",
      "I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,\nthe man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could\ndistinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse\nthickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.",
      "Service is over,  I announced.",
      "My master will be here in half an\nhour.",
      "Heathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never\nmoved.",
      "Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road\ntowards the kitchen wing.",
      "Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the\ngate himself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely\nafternoon that breathed as soft as summer.",
      "Now he is here,  I exclaimed.",
      "For heaven s sake, hurry down!",
      "You ll\nnot meet any one on the front stairs.",
      "Do be quick; and stay among the\ntrees till he is fairly in.",
      "I must go, Cathy,  said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from\nhis companion s arms.",
      "But if I live, I ll see you again before you are\nasleep.",
      "I won t stray five yards from your window.",
      "You must not go!",
      "she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength\nallowed.",
      "You _shall_ not, I tell you.",
      "For one hour,  he pleaded earnestly.",
      "Not for one minute,  she replied.",
      "I _must_ Linton will be up immediately,  persisted the alarmed\nintruder.",
      "He would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act she clung fast,\ngasping: there was mad resolution in her face.",
      "No!",
      "she shrieked.",
      "Oh, don t, don t go.",
      "It is the last time!",
      "Edgar\nwill not hurt us.",
      "Heathcliff, I shall die!",
      "I shall die!",
      "Damn the fool!",
      "There he is,  cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his\nseat.",
      "Hush, my darling!",
      "Hush, hush, Catherine!",
      "I ll stay.",
      "If he shot\nme so, I d expire with a blessing on my lips.",
      "And there they were fast again.",
      "I heard my master mounting the\nstairs the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.",
      "Are you going to listen to her ravings?",
      "I said, passionately.",
      "She\ndoes not know what she says.",
      "Will you ruin her, because she has not wit\nto help herself?",
      "Get up!",
      "You could be free instantly.",
      "That is the most\ndiabolical deed that ever you did.",
      "We are all done for master,\nmistress, and servant.",
      "I wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at\nthe noise.",
      "In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to\nobserve that Catherine s arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung\ndown.",
      "She s fainted, or dead,  I thought:  so much the better.",
      "Far better\nthat she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to\nall about her.",
      "Edgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and\nrage.",
      "What he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all\ndemonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his\narms.",
      "Look there!",
      "he said.",
      "Unless you be a fiend, help her first then you\nshall speak to me!",
      "He walked into the parlour, and sat down.",
      "Mr. Linton summoned me, and\nwith great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to\nrestore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and\nmoaned, and knew nobody.",
      "Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her\nhated friend.",
      "I did not.",
      "I went, at the earliest opportunity, and\nbesought him to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he\nshould hear from me in the morning how she passed the night.",
      "I shall not refuse to go out of doors,  he answered;  but I shall stay\nin the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.",
      "I shall\nbe under those larch-trees.",
      "Mind!",
      "or I pay another visit, whether\nLinton be in or not.",
      "He sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,\nascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the\nhouse of his luckless presence.",
      "CHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAbout twelve o clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at\nWuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months  child; and two hours after the\nmother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss\nHeathcliff, or know Edgar.",
      "The latter s distraction at his bereavement\nis a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how\ndeep the sorrow sunk.",
      "A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left\nwithout an heir.",
      "I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and\nI mentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the\nsecuring his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son s. An\nunwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!",
      "It might have wailed out of life,\nand nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.",
      "We\nredeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as\nits end is likely to be.",
      "Next morning bright and cheerful out of doors stole softened in through\nthe blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant\nwith a mellow, tender glow.",
      "Edgar Linton had his head laid on the\npillow, and his eyes shut.",
      "His young and fair features were almost as\ndeathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but\n_his_ was the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.",
      "Her brow smooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a\nsmile; no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.",
      "And I partook of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never\nin a holier frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine\nrest.",
      "I instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours\nbefore:  Incomparably beyond and above us all!",
      "Whether still on earth\nor now in heaven, her spirit is at home with God!",
      "I don t know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise\nthan happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied\nor despairing mourner share the duty with me.",
      "I see a repose that\nneither earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the\nendless and shadowless hereafter the Eternity they have entered where\nlife is boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in\nits fulness.",
      "I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is\neven in a love like Mr. Linton s, when he so regretted Catherine s\nblessed release!",
      "To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward\nand impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of\npeace at last.",
      "One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not\nthen, in the presence of her corpse.",
      "It asserted its own tranquillity,\nwhich seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.",
      "Do you believe such people _are_ happy in the other world, sir?",
      "I d\ngive a great deal to know.",
      "I declined answering Mrs. Dean s question, which struck me as something\nheterodox.",
      "She proceeded:\n\nRetracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to\nthink she is; but we ll leave her with her Maker.",
      "The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the\nroom and steal out to the pure refreshing air.",
      "The servants thought me\ngone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my\nchief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "If he had remained among the\nlarches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the\nGrange; unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger\ngoing to Gimmerton.",
      "If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware,\nfrom the lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of\nthe outer doors, that all was not right within.",
      "I wished, yet feared,\nto find him.",
      "I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get\nit over; but _how_ to do it I did not know.",
      "He was there at least, a\nfew yards further in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat\noff, and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded\nbranches, and fell pattering round him.",
      "He had been standing a long\ntime in that position, for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing\nscarcely three feet from him, busy in building their nest, and\nregarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber.",
      "They\nflew off at my approach, and he raised his eyes and spoke: She s\ndead!",
      "he said;  I ve not waited for you to learn that.",
      "Put your\nhandkerchief away don t snivel before me.",
      "Damn you all!",
      "she wants none\nof _your_ tears!",
      "I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures\nthat have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.",
      "When I\nfirst looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of\nthe catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was\nquelled and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on\nthe ground.",
      "Yes, she s dead!",
      "I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.",
      "Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take\ndue warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!",
      "Did _she_ take due warning, then?",
      "asked Heathcliff, attempting a\nsneer.",
      "Did she die like a saint?",
      "Come, give me a true history of the\nevent.",
      "How did ?",
      "He endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and\ncompressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,\ndefying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.",
      "How did she die?",
      "he resumed, at last fain, notwithstanding his\nhardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he\ntrembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.",
      "Poor wretch!",
      "I thought;  you have a heart and nerves the same as your\nbrother men!",
      "Why should you be anxious to conceal them?",
      "Your pride\ncannot blind God!",
      "You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of\nhumiliation.",
      "Quietly as a lamb!",
      "I answered, aloud.",
      "She drew a sigh, and stretched\nherself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five\nminutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!",
      "And did she ever mention me?",
      "he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded\nthe answer to his question would introduce details that he could not\nbear to hear.",
      "Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you\nleft her,  I said.",
      "She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her\nlatest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days.",
      "Her life closed in a\ngentle dream may she wake as kindly in the other world!",
      "May she wake in torment!",
      "he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping\nhis foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.",
      "Why, she s a liar to the end!",
      "Where is she?",
      "Not _there_ not in\nheaven not perished where?",
      "Oh!",
      "you said you cared nothing for my\nsufferings!",
      "And I pray one prayer I repeat it till my tongue\nstiffens Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;\nyou said I killed you haunt me, then!",
      "The murdered _do_ haunt their\nmurderers, I believe.",
      "I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth.",
      "Be\nwith me always take any form drive me mad!",
      "only _do_ not leave me in\nthis abyss, where I cannot find you!",
      "Oh, God!",
      "it is unutterable!",
      "I\n_cannot_ live without my life!",
      "I _cannot_ live without my soul!",
      "He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,\nhowled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death\nwith knives and spears.",
      "I observed several splashes of blood about the\nbark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably\nthe scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the\nnight.",
      "It hardly moved my compassion it appalled me: still, I felt\nreluctant to quit him so.",
      "But the moment he recollected himself enough\nto notice me watching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I\nobeyed.",
      "He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!",
      "Mrs. Linton s funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday\nfollowing her decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and\nstrewn with flowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.",
      "Linton spent his days and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and a\ncircumstance concealed from all but me Heathcliff spent his nights, at\nleast, outside, equally a stranger to repose.",
      "I held no communication\nwith him; still, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could;\nand on the Tuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer\nfatigue, had been compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and\nopened one of the windows; moved by his perseverance to give him a\nchance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu.",
      "He\ndid not omit to avail himself of the opportunity, cautiously and\nbriefly; too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise.",
      "Indeed, I shouldn t have discovered that he had been there, except for\nthe disarrangement of the drapery about the corpse s face, and for\nobserving on the floor a curl of light hair, fastened with a silver\nthread; which, on examination, I ascertained to have been taken from a\nlocket hung round Catherine s neck.",
      "Heathcliff had opened the trinket\nand cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own.",
      "I\ntwisted the two, and enclosed them together.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his\nsister to the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that,\nbesides her husband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and\nservants.",
      "Isabella was not asked.",
      "The place of Catherine s interment, to the surprise of the villagers,\nwas neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor\nyet by the tombs of her own relations, outside.",
      "It was dug on a green\nslope in a corner of the kirkyard, where the wall is so low that heath\nand bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould\nalmost buries it.",
      "Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have\neach a simple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to\nmark the graves.",
      "CHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThat Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.",
      "In the evening\nthe weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and\nbrought rain first, and then sleet and snow.",
      "On the morrow one could\nhardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses\nand crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent,\nthe young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.",
      "And dreary,\nand chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!",
      "My master kept his\nroom; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a\nnursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid\non my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still\ndriving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened,\nand some person entered, out of breath and laughing!",
      "My anger was\ngreater than my astonishment for a minute.",
      "I supposed it one of the\nmaids, and I cried Have done!",
      "How dare you show your giddiness here?",
      "What would Mr. Linton say if he heard you?",
      "Excuse me!",
      "answered a familiar voice;  but I know Edgar is in bed,\nand I cannot stop myself.",
      "With that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her\nhand to her side.",
      "I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!",
      "she continued, after\na pause;  except where I ve flown.",
      "I couldn t count the number of falls\nI ve had.",
      "Oh, I m aching all over!",
      "Don t be alarmed!",
      "There shall be an\nexplanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to\nstep out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a\nservant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.",
      "The intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.",
      "She certainly seemed in no laughing\npredicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and\nwater; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore,\nbefitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short\nsleeves, and nothing on either head or neck.",
      "The frock was of light\nsilk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by\nthin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the\ncold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and\nbruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue; and\nyou may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had\nleisure to examine her.",
      "My dear young lady,  I exclaimed,  I ll stir nowhere, and hear\nnothing, till you have removed every article of your clothes, and put\non dry things; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so\nit is needless to order the carriage.",
      "Certainly I shall,  she said;  walking or riding: yet I ve no\nobjection to dress myself decently.",
      "And ah, see how it flows down my\nneck now!",
      "The fire does make it smart.",
      "She insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me\ntouch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get\nready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain\nher consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.",
      "Now, Ellen,  she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in\nan easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her,  you sit\ndown opposite me, and put poor Catherine s baby away: I don t like to\nsee it!",
      "You mustn t think I care little for Catherine, because I\nbehaved so foolishly on entering: I ve cried, too, bitterly yes, more\nthan any one else has reason to cry.",
      "We parted unreconciled, you\nremember, and I sha n t forgive myself.",
      "But, for all that, I was not\ngoing to sympathise with him the brute beast!",
      "Oh, give me the poker!",
      "This is the last thing of his I have about me:  she slipped the gold\nring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor.",
      "I ll smash it!",
      "she continued, striking it with childish spite,  and then I ll burn\nit!",
      "and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals.",
      "There!",
      "he shall buy another, if he gets me back again.",
      "He d be capable\nof coming to seek me, to tease Edgar.",
      "I dare not stay, lest that notion\nshould possess his wicked head!",
      "And besides, Edgar has not been kind,\nhas he?",
      "And I won t come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him\ninto more trouble.",
      "Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though,\nif I had not learned he was out of the way, I d have halted at the\nkitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted,\nand departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed of that\nincarnate goblin!",
      "Ah, he was in such a fury!",
      "If he had caught me!",
      "It s\na pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn t have run till\nI d seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!",
      "Well, don t talk so fast, Miss!",
      "I interrupted;  you ll disorder the\nhandkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.",
      "Drink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is\nsadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!",
      "An undeniable truth,  she replied.",
      "Listen to that child!",
      "It maintains\na constant wail send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha n t stay\nany longer.",
      "I rang the bell, and committed it to a servant s care; and then I\ninquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an\nunlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining\nwith us.",
      "I ought, and I wished to remain,  answered she,  to cheer Edgar and\ntake care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my\nright home.",
      "But I tell you he wouldn t let me!",
      "Do you think he could\nbear to see me grow fat and merry could bear to think that we were\ntranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort?",
      "Now, I have the\nsatisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its\nannoying him seriously to have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I\nnotice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are\ninvoluntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising\nfrom his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for\nhim, and partly from original aversion.",
      "It is strong enough to make me\nfeel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing\nI contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away.",
      "I ve\nrecovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I d rather he d\nkill himself!",
      "He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I m at my\nease.",
      "I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I\ncould still be loving him, if no, no!",
      "Even if he had doted on me, the\ndevilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow.",
      "Catherine\nhad an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so\nwell.",
      "Monster!",
      "would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out\nof my memory!",
      "Hush, hush!",
      "He s a human being,  I said.",
      "Be more charitable: there\nare worse men than he is yet!",
      "He s not a human being,  she retorted;  and he has no claim on my\ncharity.",
      "I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and\nflung it back to me.",
      "People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he\nhas destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,\nthough he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood\nfor Catherine!",
      "No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn t!",
      "And here Isabella began\nto cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she\nrecommenced.",
      "You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?",
      "I was\ncompelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a\npitch above his malignity.",
      "Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers\nrequires more coolness than knocking on the head.",
      "He was worked up to\nforget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous\nviolence.",
      "I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the\nsense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly\nbroke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a\nsignal revenge.",
      "Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral.",
      "He\nkept himself sober for the purpose tolerably sober: not going to bed\nmad at six o clock and getting up drunk at twelve.",
      "Consequently, he\nrose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance;\nand instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by\ntumblerfuls.",
      "Heathcliff I shudder to name him!",
      "has been a stranger in the house\nfrom last Sunday till to-day.",
      "Whether the angels have fed him, or his\nkin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for\nnearly a week.",
      "He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his\nchamber; locking himself in as if anybody dreamt of coveting his\ncompany!",
      "There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the\ndeity he implored is senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed,\nwas curiously confounded with his own black father!",
      "After concluding\nthese precious orisons and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse\nand his voice was strangled in his throat he would be off again; always\nstraight down to the Grange!",
      "I wonder Edgar did not send for a\nconstable, and give him into custody!",
      "For me, grieved as I was about\nCatherine, it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of\ndeliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday.",
      "I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph s eternal lectures\nwithout weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot\nof a frightened thief than formerly.",
      "You wouldn t think that I should\ncry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable\ncompanions.",
      "I d rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than\nwith  t  little maister  and his staunch supporter, that odious old\nman!",
      "When Heathcliff is in, I m often obliged to seek the kitchen and\ntheir society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he\nis not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one\ncorner of the house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy\nhimself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements.",
      "He is quieter\nnow than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and\ndepressed, and less furious.",
      "Joseph affirms he s sure he s an altered\nman: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved  so as by\nfire.",
      "I m puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is\nnot my business.",
      "Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on\ntowards twelve.",
      "It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow\nblowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard\nand the new-made grave!",
      "I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page\nbefore me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.",
      "Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on\nthe same subject.",
      "He had ceased drinking at a point below\nirrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three\nhours.",
      "There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which\nshook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals,\nand the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of\nthe candle.",
      "Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed.",
      "It was\nvery, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy\nhad vanished from the world, never to be restored.",
      "The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen\nlatch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual;\nowing, I suppose, to the sudden storm.",
      "That entrance was fastened, and\nwe heard him coming round to get in by the other.",
      "I rose with an\nirrepressible expression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my\ncompanion, who had been staring towards the door, to turn and look at\nme.",
      "I ll keep him out five minutes,  he exclaimed.",
      "You won t object?",
      "No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,  I answered.",
      "Do!",
      "put the key in the lock, and draw the bolts.",
      "Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then\ncame and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over\nit, and searching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that\ngleamed from his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he\ncouldn t exactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him\nto speak.",
      "You, and I,  he said,  have each a great debt to settle with the man\nout yonder!",
      "If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to\ndischarge it.",
      "Are you as soft as your brother?",
      "Are you willing to\nendure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?",
      "I m weary of enduring now,  I replied;  and I d be glad of a\nretaliation that wouldn t recoil on myself; but treachery and violence\nare spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them\nworse than their enemies.",
      "Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!",
      "cried Hindley.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff, I ll ask you to do nothing; but sit\nstill and be dumb.",
      "Tell me now, can you?",
      "I m sure you would have as\nmuch pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend s\nexistence; he ll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he ll be\n_my_ ruin.",
      "Damn the hellish villain!",
      "He knocks at the door as if he\nwere master here already!",
      "Promise to hold your tongue, and before that\nclock strikes it wants three minutes of one you re a free woman!",
      "He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his\nbreast, and would have turned down the candle.",
      "I snatched it away,\nhowever, and seized his arm.",
      "I ll not hold my tongue!",
      "I said;  you mustn t touch him.",
      "Let the\ndoor remain shut, and be quiet!",
      "No!",
      "I ve formed my resolution, and by God I ll execute it!",
      "cried the\ndesperate being.",
      "I ll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and\nHareton justice!",
      "And you needn t trouble your head to screen me;\nCatherine is gone.",
      "Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though\nI cut my throat this minute and it s time to make an end!",
      "I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a\nlunatic.",
      "The only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his\nintended victim of the fate which awaited him.",
      "You d better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!",
      "I exclaimed, in\nrather a triumphant tone.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you\npersist in endeavouring to enter.",
      "You d better open the door, you  he answered, addressing me by some\nelegant term that I don t care to repeat.",
      "I shall not meddle in the matter,  I retorted again.",
      "Come in and get\nshot, if you please.",
      "I ve done my duty.",
      "With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire;\nhaving too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any\nanxiety for the danger that menaced him.",
      "Earnshaw swore passionately at\nme: affirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of\nnames for the base spirit I evinced.",
      "And I, in my secret heart (and\nconscience never reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be\nfor _him_ should Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing\nfor _me_ should he send Heathcliff to his right abode!",
      "As I sat nursing\nthese reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by\na blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked\nblightingly through.",
      "The stanchions stood too close to suffer his\nshoulders to follow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security.",
      "His\nhair and clothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth,\nrevealed by cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.",
      "Isabella, let me in, or I ll make you repent!",
      "he  girned,  as Joseph\ncalls it.",
      "I cannot commit murder,  I replied.",
      "Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with\na knife and loaded pistol.",
      "Let me in by the kitchen door,  he said.",
      "Hindley will be there before me,  I answered:  and that s a poor love\nof yours that cannot bear a shower of snow!",
      "We were left at peace in\nour beds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of\nwinter returns, you must run for shelter!",
      "Heathcliff, if I were you,\nI d go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog.",
      "The\nworld is surely not worth living in now, is it?",
      "You had distinctly\nimpressed on me the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life:\nI can t imagine how you think of surviving her loss.",
      "He s there, is he?",
      "exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap.",
      "If I\ncan get my arm out I can hit him!",
      "I m afraid, Ellen, you ll set me down as really wicked; but you don t\nknow all, so don t judge.",
      "I wouldn t have aided or abetted an attempt\non even _his_ life for anything.",
      "Wish that he were dead, I must; and\ntherefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the\nconsequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw s\nweapon and wrenched it from his grasp.",
      "The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its\nowner s wrist.",
      "Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the\nflesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket.",
      "He then\ntook a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang\nin.",
      "His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow\nof blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein.",
      "The ruffian\nkicked and trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the\nflags, holding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning\nJoseph.",
      "He exerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing\nhim completely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and\ndragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle.",
      "There he tore\noff the sleeve of Earnshaw s coat, and bound up the wound with brutal\nroughness; spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically\nas he had kicked before.",
      "Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking\nthe old servant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my\nhasty tale, hurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at\nonce.",
      "What is ther to do, now?",
      "what is ther to do, now?",
      "There s this to do,  thundered Heathcliff,  that your master s mad;\nand should he last another month, I ll have him to an asylum.",
      "And how\nthe devil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?",
      "Don t\nstand muttering and mumbling there.",
      "Come, I m not going to nurse him.",
      "Wash that stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle it is more\nthan half brandy!",
      "And so ye ve been murthering on him?",
      "exclaimed Joseph, lifting his\nhands and eyes in horror.",
      "If iver I seed a seeght loike this!",
      "May the\nLord \n\n Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,\nand flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he\njoined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its\nodd phraseology.",
      "I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at\nnothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves\nat the foot of the gallows.",
      "Oh, I forgot you,  said the tyrant.",
      "You shall do that.",
      "Down with\nyou.",
      "And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?",
      "There, that\nis work fit for you!",
      "He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who\nsteadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would\nset off for the Grange directly.",
      "Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and\nthough he had fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.",
      "He was so\nobstinate in his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to\ncompel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing\nover me, heaving with malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the\naccount in answer to his questions.",
      "It required a great deal of labour\nto satisfy the old man that Heathcliff was not the aggressor;\nespecially with my hardly-wrung replies.",
      "However, Mr. Earnshaw soon\nconvinced him that he was alive still; Joseph hastened to administer a\ndose of spirits, and by their succour his master presently regained\nmotion and consciousness.",
      "Heathcliff, aware that his opponent was\nignorant of the treatment received while insensible, called him\ndeliriously intoxicated; and said he should not notice his atrocious\nconduct further, but advised him to get to bed.",
      "To my joy, he left us,\nafter giving this judicious counsel, and Hindley stretched himself on\nthe hearthstone.",
      "I departed to my own room, marvelling that I had\nescaped so easily.",
      "This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.\nEarnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost\nas gaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.",
      "Neither appeared\ninclined to dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I\ncommenced alone.",
      "Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I\nexperienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at\nintervals, I cast a look towards my silent companions, and felt the\ncomfort of a quiet conscience within me.",
      "After I had done, I ventured\non the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw s\nseat, and kneeling in the corner beside him.",
      "Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his\nfeatures almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.",
      "His\nforehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so\ndiabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were\nnearly quenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes\nwere wet then: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in\nan expression of unspeakable sadness.",
      "Had it been another, I would have\ncovered my face in the presence of such grief.",
      "In _his_ case, I was\ngratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I\ncouldn t miss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the\nonly time when I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.",
      "Fie, fie, Miss!",
      "I interrupted.",
      "One might suppose you had never\nopened a Bible in your life.",
      "If God afflict your enemies, surely that\nought to suffice you.",
      "It is both mean and presumptuous to add your\ntorture to his!",
      "In general I ll allow that it would be, Ellen,  she continued;  but\nwhat misery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand\nin it?",
      "I d rather he suffered _less_, if I might cause his sufferings\nand he might _know_ that I was the cause.",
      "Oh, I owe him so much.",
      "On\nonly one condition can I hope to forgive him.",
      "It is, if I may take an\neye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a\nwrench: reduce him to my level.",
      "As he was the first to injure, make him\nthe first to implore pardon; and then why then, Ellen, I might show you\nsome generosity.",
      "But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged,\nand therefore I cannot forgive him.",
      "Hindley wanted some water, and I\nhanded him a glass, and asked him how he was.",
      "Not as ill as I wish,  he replied.",
      "But leaving out my arm, every\ninch of me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!",
      "Yes, no wonder,  was my next remark.",
      "Catherine used to boast that\nshe stood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons\nwould not hurt you for fear of offending her.",
      "It s well people don t\n_really_ rise from their grave, or, last night, she might have\nwitnessed a repulsive scene!",
      "Are not you bruised, and cut over your\nchest and shoulders?",
      "I can t say,  he answered;  but what do you mean?",
      "Did he dare to\nstrike me when I was down?",
      "He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,  I\nwhispered.",
      "And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because\nhe s only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.",
      "Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;\nwho, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:\nthe longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their\nblackness through his features.",
      "Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last\nagony, I d go to hell with joy,  groaned the impatient man, writhing to\nrise, and sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the\nstruggle.",
      "Nay, it s enough that he has murdered one of you,  I observed aloud.",
      "At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now\nhad it not been for Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "After all, it is preferable to be\nhated than loved by him.",
      "When I recollect how happy we were how happy\nCatherine was before he came I m fit to curse the day.",
      "Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than\nthe spirit of the person who said it.",
      "His attention was roused, I saw,\nfor his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath\nin suffocating sighs.",
      "I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.",
      "The\nclouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which\nusually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not\nfear to hazard another sound of derision.",
      "Get up, and begone out of my sight,  said the mourner.",
      "I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was\nhardly intelligible.",
      "I beg your pardon,  I replied.",
      "But I loved Catherine too; and her\nbrother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.",
      "Now\nthat she s dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if\nyou had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and\nher \n\n Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!",
      "he cried,\nmaking a movement that caused me to make one also.",
      "But then,  I continued, holding myself ready to flee,  if poor\nCatherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,\ndegrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a\nsimilar picture!",
      "_She_ wouldn t have borne your abominable behaviour\nquietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.",
      "The back of the settle and Earnshaw s person interposed between me and\nhim; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife\nfrom the table and flung it at my head.",
      "It struck beneath my ear, and\nstopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to\nthe door and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than\nhis missile.",
      "The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his\npart, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together\non the hearth.",
      "In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to\nhis master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies\nfrom a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from\npurgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,\nquitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,\nand wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the\nbeacon-light of the Grange.",
      "And far rather would I be condemned to a\nperpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,\nabide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.",
      "Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and\nbidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and\nturning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she\nstepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar s and Catherine s portraits,\nbestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage,\naccompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her\nmistress.",
      "She was driven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but\na regular correspondence was established between her and my master when\nthings were more settled.",
      "I believe her new abode was in the south,\nnear London; there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her\nescape.",
      "He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him\nto be an ailing, peevish creature.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she\nlived.",
      "I refused to tell.",
      "He remarked that it was not of any moment,\nonly she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with\nhim, if he had to keep her himself.",
      "Though I would give no information,\nhe discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of\nresidence and the existence of the child.",
      "Still, he didn t molest her:\nfor which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.",
      "He often\nasked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled\ngrimly, and observed:  They wish me to hate it too, do they?",
      "I don t think they wish you to know anything about it,  I answered.",
      "But I ll have it,  he said,  when I want it.",
      "They may reckon on that!",
      "Fortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen\nyears after the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a\nlittle more.",
      "On the day succeeding Isabella s unexpected visit I had no opportunity\nof speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for\ndiscussing nothing.",
      "When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased\nhim that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an\nintensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to\nallow.",
      "So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from\ngoing anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.",
      "Grief,\nand that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up\nhis office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the\nvillage on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within\nthe limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on\nthe moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or\nearly morning before other wanderers were abroad.",
      "But he was too good\nto be thoroughly unhappy long.",
      "_He_ didn t pray for Catherine s soul to\nhaunt him.",
      "Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than\ncommon joy.",
      "He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and\nhopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was\ngone.",
      "And he had earthly consolation and affections also.",
      "For a few days, I\nsaid, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that\ncoldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could\nstammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot s sceptre in his\nheart.",
      "It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,\nas he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because\nHeathcliff had a habit of doing so.",
      "The little one was always Cathy: it\nformed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with\nher; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than\nfrom its being his own.",
      "I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and\nperplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so\nopposite in similar circumstances.",
      "They had both been fond husbands,\nand were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they\nshouldn t both have taken the same road, for good or evil.",
      "But, I\nthought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has\nshown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man.",
      "When his ship struck,\nthe captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save\nher, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless\nvessel.",
      "Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal\nand faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him.",
      "One hoped,\nand the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were\nrighteously doomed to endure them.",
      "But you ll not want to hear my\nmoralising, Mr. Lockwood; you ll judge, as well as I can, all these\nthings: at least, you ll think you will, and that s the same.",
      "The end\nof Earnshaw was what might have been expected; it followed fast on his\nsister s: there were scarcely six months between them.",
      "We, at the\nGrange, never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it;\nall that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the\npreparations for the funeral.",
      "Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to\nmy master.",
      "Well, Nelly,  said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not\nto alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news,  it s yours and\nmy turn to go into mourning at present.",
      "Who s given us the slip now, do\nyou think?",
      "Who?",
      "I asked in a flurry.",
      "Why, guess!",
      "he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a\nhook by the door.",
      "And nip up the corner of your apron: I m certain\nyou ll need it.",
      "Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "What!",
      "would you have tears for him?",
      "said the doctor.",
      "No,\nHeathcliff s a tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day.",
      "I ve just\nseen him.",
      "He s rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.",
      "Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?",
      "I repeated impatiently.",
      "Hindley Earnshaw!",
      "Your old friend Hindley,  he replied,  and my wicked\ngossip: though he s been too wild for me this long while.",
      "There!",
      "I said\nwe should draw water.",
      "But cheer up!",
      "He died true to his character:\ndrunk as a lord.",
      "Poor lad!",
      "I m sorry, too.",
      "One can t help missing an\nold companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man\nimagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.",
      "He s barely\ntwenty-seven, it seems; that s your own age: who would have thought you\nwere born in one year?",
      "I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton s\ndeath: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the\nporch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get\nanother servant to introduce him to the master.",
      "I could not hinder\nmyself from pondering on the question Had he had fair play?",
      "Whatever\nI did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious\nthat I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and\nassist in the last duties to the dead.",
      "Mr. Linton was extremely\nreluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless\ncondition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother\nhad a claim on my services as strong as his own.",
      "Besides, I reminded\nhim that the child Hareton was his wife s nephew, and, in the absence\nof nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and\nmust inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of\nhis brother-in-law.",
      "He was unfit for attending to such matters then,\nbut he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.",
      "His lawyer had been Earnshaw s also: I called at the village, and asked\nhim to accompany me.",
      "He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff\nshould be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would\nbe found little else than a beggar.",
      "His father died in debt,  he said;  the whole property is mortgaged,\nand the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity\nof creating some interest in the creditor s heart, that he may be\ninclined to deal leniently towards him.",
      "When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see\neverything carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient\ndistress, expressed satisfaction at my presence.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff said he\ndid not perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the\narrangements for the funeral, if I chose.",
      "Correctly,  he remarked,  that fool s body should be buried at the\ncross-roads, without ceremony of any kind.",
      "I happened to leave him ten\nminutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two\ndoors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking\nhimself to death deliberately!",
      "We broke in this morning, for we heard\nhim snorting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:\nflaying and scalping would not have wakened him.",
      "I sent for Kenneth,\nand he came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was\nboth dead and cold, and stark; and so you ll allow it was useless\nmaking more stir about him!",
      "The old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:\n\n I d rayther he d goan hisseln for t  doctor!",
      "I sud ha  taen tent o  t \nmaister better nor him and he warn t deead when I left, naught o  t \nsoart!",
      "I insisted on the funeral being respectable.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff said I\nmight have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that\nthe money for the whole affair came out of his pocket.",
      "He maintained a\nhard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if\nanything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult\nwork successfully executed.",
      "I observed once, indeed, something like\nexultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the\ncoffin from the house.",
      "He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and\nprevious to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on\nto the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto,  Now, my bonny lad, you\nare _mine_!",
      "And we ll see if one tree won t grow as crooked as another,\nwith the same wind to twist it!",
      "The unsuspecting thing was pleased at\nthis speech: he played with Heathcliff s whiskers, and stroked his\ncheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly,  That boy must\ngo back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.",
      "There is nothing in the\nworld less yours than he is!",
      "Does Linton say so?",
      "he demanded.",
      "Of course he has ordered me to take him,  I replied.",
      "Well,  said the scoundrel,  we ll not argue the subject now: but I\nhave a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your\nmaster that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt\nto remove it.",
      "I don t engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I ll be\npretty sure to make the other come!",
      "Remember to tell him.",
      "This hint was enough to bind our hands.",
      "I repeated its substance on my\nreturn; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke\nno more of interfering.",
      "I m not aware that he could have done it to any\npurpose, had he been ever so willing.",
      "The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm\npossession, and proved to the attorney who, in his turn, proved it to\nMr. Linton that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for\ncash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the\nmortgagee.",
      "In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first\ngentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete\ndependence on his father s inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house\nas a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right\nhimself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has\nbeen wronged.",
      "CHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThe twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period\nwere the happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage\nrose from our little lady s trifling illnesses, which she had to\nexperience in common with all children, rich and poor.",
      "For the rest,\nafter the first six months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and\ntalk too, in her own way, before the heath blossomed a second time over\nMrs. Linton s dust.",
      "She was the most winning thing that ever brought\nsunshine into a desolate house: a real beauty in face, with the\nEarnshaws  handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons  fair skin and small\nfeatures, and yellow curling hair.",
      "Her spirit was high, though not\nrough, and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its\naffections.",
      "That capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her\nmother: still she did not resemble her: for she could be soft and mild\nas a dove, and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression: her anger\nwas never furious; her love never fierce: it was deep and tender.",
      "However, it must be acknowledged, she had faults to foil her gifts.",
      "A\npropensity to be saucy was one; and a perverse will, that indulged\nchildren invariably acquire, whether they be good tempered or cross.",
      "If\na servant chanced to vex her, it was always I shall tell papa!",
      "And if\nhe reproved her, even by a look, you would have thought it a\nheart-breaking business: I don t believe he ever did speak a harsh word\nto her.",
      "He took her education entirely on himself, and made it an\namusement.",
      "Fortunately, curiosity and a quick intellect made her an apt\nscholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and did honour to his\nteaching.",
      "Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the\nrange of the park by herself.",
      "Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile\nor so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.",
      "Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only\nbuilding she had approached or entered, except her own home.",
      "Wuthering\nHeights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect\nrecluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, while\nsurveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe \n\n Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those\nhills?",
      "I wonder what lies on the other side is it the sea?",
      "No, Miss Cathy,  I would answer;  it is hills again, just like these.",
      "And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?",
      "she\nonce asked.",
      "The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her\nnotice; especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost\nheights, and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.",
      "I\nexplained that they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth\nin their clefts to nourish a stunted tree.",
      "And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?",
      "she\npursued.",
      "Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,  replied I;  you\ncould not climb them, they are too high and steep.",
      "In winter the frost\nis always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have\nfound snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!",
      "Oh, you have been on them!",
      "she cried gleefully.",
      "Then I can go, too,\nwhen I am a woman.",
      "Has papa been, Ellen?",
      "Papa would tell you, Miss,  I answered, hastily,  that they are not\nworth the trouble of visiting.",
      "The moors, where you ramble with him,\nare much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.",
      "But I know the park, and I don t know those,  she murmured to herself.",
      "And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest\npoint: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.",
      "One of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with\na desire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he\npromised she should have the journey when she got older.",
      "But Miss\nCatherine measured her age by months, and,  Now, am I old enough to go\nto Penistone Crags?",
      "was the constant question in her mouth.",
      "The road\nthither wound close by Wuthering Heights.",
      "Edgar had not the heart to\npass it; so she received as constantly the answer,  Not yet, love: not\nyet.",
      "I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her\nhusband.",
      "Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both\nlacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.",
      "What her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of\nthe same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but\nincurable, and rapidly consuming life towards the close.",
      "She wrote to\ninform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months \nindisposition under which she had suffered, and entreated him to come\nto her, if possible; for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid\nhim adieu, and deliver Linton safely into his hands.",
      "Her hope was that\nLinton might be left with him, as he had been with her: his father, she\nwould fain convince herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his\nmaintenance or education.",
      "My master hesitated not a moment in complying\nwith her request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls,\nhe flew to answer this; commending Catherine to my peculiar vigilance,\nin his absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of\nthe park, even under my escort: he did not calculate on her going\nunaccompanied.",
      "He was away three weeks.",
      "The first day or two my charge sat in a corner\nof the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet\nstate she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval\nof impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then,\nto run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might\nentertain herself.",
      "I used to send her on her travels round the\ngrounds now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient\naudience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.",
      "The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this\nsolitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast\ntill tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful\ntales.",
      "I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were\ngenerally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,\nif they had stood wide open.",
      "Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.",
      "Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o clock, and said she was\nthat day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his\ncaravan; and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and\nbeasts: a horse, and three camels, personated by a large hound and a\ncouple of pointers.",
      "I got together good store of dainties, and slung\nthem in a basket on one side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as\na fairy, sheltered by her wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July\nsun, and trotted off with a merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to\navoid galloping, and come back early.",
      "The naughty thing never made her\nappearance at tea.",
      "One traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond\nof its ease, returned; but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two\npointers were visible in any direction: I despatched emissaries down\nthis path, and that path, and at last went wandering in search of her\nmyself.",
      "There was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation, on\nthe borders of the grounds.",
      "I inquired of him if he had seen our young\nlady.",
      "I saw her at morn,  he replied:  she would have me to cut her a hazel\nswitch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it\nis lowest, and galloped out of sight.",
      "You may guess how I felt at hearing this news.",
      "It struck me directly\nshe must have started for Penistone Crags.",
      "What will become of her?",
      "I\nejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and\nmaking straight to the high-road.",
      "I walked as if for a wager, mile\nafter mile, till a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no\nCatherine could I detect, far or near.",
      "The Crags lie about a mile and a\nhalf beyond Mr. Heathcliff s place, and that is four from the Grange,\nso I began to fear night would fall ere I could reach them.",
      "And what\nif she should have slipped in clambering among them,  I reflected,  and\nbeen killed, or broken some of her bones?",
      "My suspense was truly\npainful; and, at first, it gave me delightful relief to observe, in\nhurrying by the farmhouse, Charlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying\nunder a window, with swelled head and bleeding ear.",
      "I opened the wicket\nand ran to the door, knocking vehemently for admittance.",
      "A woman whom I\nknew, and who formerly lived at Gimmerton, answered: she had been\nservant there since the death of Mr. Earnshaw.",
      "Ah,  said she,  you are come a-seeking your little mistress!",
      "Don t be\nfrightened.",
      "She s here safe: but I m glad it isn t the master.",
      "He is not at home then, is he?",
      "I panted, quite breathless with quick\nwalking and alarm.",
      "No, no,  she replied:  both he and Joseph are off, and I think they\nwon t return this hour or more.",
      "Step in and rest you a bit.",
      "I entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking\nherself in a little chair that had been her mother s when a child.",
      "Her\nhat was hung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home,\nlaughing and chattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton now\na great, strong lad of eighteen who stared at her with considerable\ncuriosity and astonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent\nsuccession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased\npouring forth.",
      "Very well, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry\ncountenance.",
      "This is your last ride, till papa comes back.",
      "I ll not\ntrust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!",
      "Aha, Ellen!",
      "she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.",
      "I\nshall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you ve found me out.",
      "Have you ever been here in your life before?",
      "Put that hat on, and home at once,  said I.  I m dreadfully grieved at\nyou, Miss Cathy: you ve done extremely wrong!",
      "It s no use pouting and\ncrying: that won t repay the trouble I ve had, scouring the country\nafter you.",
      "To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you\nstealing off so!",
      "It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will\nput faith in you any more.",
      "What have I done?",
      "sobbed she, instantly checked.",
      "Papa charged me\nnothing: he ll not scold me, Ellen he s never cross, like you!",
      "Come, come!",
      "I repeated.",
      "I ll tie the riband.",
      "Now, let us have no\npetulance.",
      "Oh, for shame!",
      "You thirteen years old, and such a baby!",
      "This exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and\nretreating to the chimney out of my reach.",
      "Nay,  said the servant,  don t be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.",
      "We made her stop: she d fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be\nuneasy.",
      "Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it s a\nwild road over the hills.",
      "Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets,\ntoo awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my\nintrusion.",
      "How long am I to wait?",
      "I continued, disregarding the woman s\ninterference.",
      "It will be dark in ten minutes.",
      "Where is the pony, Miss\nCathy?",
      "And where is Phoenix?",
      "I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so\nplease yourself.",
      "The pony is in the yard,  she replied,  and Phoenix is shut in there.",
      "He s bitten and so is Charlie.",
      "I was going to tell you all about it;\nbut you are in a bad temper, and don t deserve to hear.",
      "I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving\nthat the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering\nround the room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under\nand behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.",
      "Hareton and the woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more\nimpertinent still; till I cried, in great irritation, Well, Miss\nCathy, if you were aware whose house this is you d be glad enough to\nget out.",
      "It s _your_ father s, isn t it?",
      "said she, turning to Hareton.",
      "Nay,  he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.",
      "He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just\nhis own.",
      "Whose then your master s?",
      "she asked.",
      "He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and\nturned away.",
      "Who is his master?",
      "continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.",
      "He\ntalked about  our house,  and  our folk.",
      "I thought he had been the\nowner s son.",
      "And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn t he,\nif he s a servant?",
      "Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.",
      "I\nsilently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her\nfor departure.",
      "Now, get my horse,  she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she\nwould one of the stable-boys at the Grange.",
      "And you may come with me.",
      "I want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear\nabout the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!",
      "What s the\nmatter?",
      "Get my horse, I say.",
      "I ll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!",
      "growled the lad.",
      "You ll see me _what?_  asked Catherine in surprise.",
      "Damned thou saucy witch!",
      "he replied.",
      "There, Miss Cathy!",
      "you see you have got into pretty company,  I\ninterposed.",
      "Nice words to be used to a young lady!",
      "Pray don t begin to\ndispute with him.",
      "Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.",
      "But, Ellen,  cried she, staring fixed in astonishment,  how dare he\nspeak so to me?",
      "Mustn t he be made to do as I ask him?",
      "You wicked\ncreature, I shall tell papa what you said.",
      "Now, then!",
      "Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into\nher eyes with indignation.",
      "You bring the pony,  she exclaimed, turning\nto the woman,  and let my dog free this moment!",
      "Softly, Miss,  answered the addressed.",
      "You ll lose nothing by being\ncivil.",
      "Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master s son, he s your\ncousin: and I was never hired to serve you.",
      "_He_ my cousin!",
      "cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.",
      "Yes, indeed,  responded her reprover.",
      "Oh, Ellen!",
      "don t let them say such things,  she pursued in great\ntrouble.",
      "Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a\ngentleman s son.",
      "That my  she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the\nbare notion of relationship with such a clown.",
      "Hush, hush!",
      "I whispered;  people can have many cousins and of all\nsorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they\nneedn t keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.",
      "He s not he s not my cousin, Ellen!",
      "she went on, gathering fresh\ngrief from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge\nfrom the idea.",
      "I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;\nhaving no doubt of Linton s approaching arrival, communicated by the\nformer, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that\nCatherine s first thought on her father s return would be to seek an\nexplanation of the latter s assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.",
      "Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant,\nseemed moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the\ndoor, he took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp\nfrom the kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist!",
      "for he\nmeant nought.",
      "Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a\nglance of awe and horror, then burst forth anew.",
      "I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor\nfellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,\nand stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily\noccupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after\nrabbits and game.",
      "Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a\nmind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.",
      "Good\nthings lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far\nover-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a\nwealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and\nfavourable circumstances.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated\nhim physically ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no\ntemptation to that course of oppression: he had none of the timid\nsusceptibility that would have given zest to ill-treatment, in\nHeathcliff s judgment.",
      "He appeared to have bent his malevolence on\nmaking him a brute: he was never taught to read or write; never rebuked\nfor any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper; never led a single\nstep towards virtue, or guarded by a single precept against vice.",
      "And\nfrom what I heard, Joseph contributed much to his deterioration, by a\nnarrow-minded partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him, as\na boy, because he was the head of the old family.",
      "And as he had been in\nthe habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, when children,\nof putting the master past his patience, and compelling him to seek\nsolace in drink by what he termed their  offald ways,  so at present he\nlaid the whole burden of Hareton s faults on the shoulders of the\nusurper of his property.",
      "If the lad swore, he wouldn t correct him: nor\nhowever culpably he behaved.",
      "It gave Joseph satisfaction, apparently,\nto watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed that the lad was ruined:\nthat his soul was abandoned to perdition; but then he reflected that\nHeathcliff must answer for it.",
      "Hareton s blood would be required at his\nhands; and there lay immense consolation in that thought.",
      "Joseph had\ninstilled into him a pride of name, and of his lineage; he would, had\nhe dared, have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the\nHeights: but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition; and he\nconfined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private\ncomminations.",
      "I don t pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode\nof living customary in those days at Wuthering Heights: I only speak\nfrom hearsay; for I saw little.",
      "The villagers affirmed Mr. Heathcliff\nwas _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants; but the house,\ninside, had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female\nmanagement, and the scenes of riot common in Hindley s time were not\nnow enacted within its walls.",
      "The master was too gloomy to seek\ncompanionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.",
      "This, however, is not making progress with my story.",
      "Miss Cathy\nrejected the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs,\nCharlie and Phoenix.",
      "They came limping and hanging their heads; and we\nset out for home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.",
      "I could not\nwring from my little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I\nsupposed, the goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she\narrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse, when Hareton\nhappened to issue forth, attended by some canine followers, who\nattacked her train.",
      "They had a smart battle, before their owners could\nseparate them: that formed an introduction.",
      "Catherine told Hareton who\nshe was, and where she was going; and asked him to show her the way:\nfinally, beguiling him to accompany her.",
      "He opened the mysteries of the\nFairy Cave, and twenty other queer places.",
      "But, being in disgrace, I\nwas not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw.",
      "I could gather, however, that her guide had been a favourite till she\nhurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff s\nhousekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin.",
      "Then the language he\nhad held to her rankled in her heart; she who was always  love,  and\n darling,  and  queen,  and  angel,  with everybody at the Grange, to\nbe insulted so shockingly by a stranger!",
      "She did not comprehend it; and\nhard work I had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the\ngrievance before her father.",
      "I explained how he objected to the whole\nhousehold at the Heights, and how sorry he would be to find she had\nbeen there; but I insisted most on the fact, that if she revealed my\nnegligence of his orders, he would perhaps be so angry that I should\nhave to leave; and Cathy couldn t bear that prospect: she pledged her\nword, and kept it for my sake.",
      "After all, she was a sweet little girl.",
      "CHAPTER XIX\n\n\nA letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master s return.",
      "Isabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his\ndaughter, and arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his\nyouthful nephew.",
      "Catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming\nher father back; and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the\ninnumerable excellencies of her  real  cousin.",
      "The evening of their\nexpected arrival came.",
      "Since early morning she had been busy ordering\nher own small affairs; and now attired in her new black frock poor\nthing!",
      "her aunt s death impressed her with no definite sorrow she\nobliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the\ngrounds to meet them.",
      "Linton is just six months younger than I am,  she chattered, as we\nstrolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under\nshadow of the trees.",
      "How delightful it will be to have him for a\nplayfellow!",
      "Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it\nwas lighter than mine more flaxen, and quite as fine.",
      "I have it\ncarefully preserved in a little glass box; and I ve often thought what\na pleasure it would be to see its owner.",
      "Oh!",
      "I am happy and papa, dear,\ndear papa!",
      "Come, Ellen, let us run!",
      "come, run.",
      "She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober\nfootsteps reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy\nbank beside the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was\nimpossible: she couldn t be still a minute.",
      "How long they are!",
      "she exclaimed.",
      "Ah, I see some dust on the\nroad they are coming!",
      "No!",
      "When will they be here?",
      "May we not go a\nlittle way half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?",
      "Do say yes, to\nthat clump of birches at the turn!",
      "I refused staunchly.",
      "At length her suspense was ended: the travelling\ncarriage rolled in sight.",
      "Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her\narms as soon as she caught her father s face looking from the window.",
      "He descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval\nelapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.",
      "While\nthey exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.",
      "He was\nasleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had\nbeen winter.",
      "A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been\ntaken for my master s younger brother, so strong was the resemblance:\nbut there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton\nnever had.",
      "The latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised\nme to close the door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had\nfatigued him.",
      "Cathy would fain have taken one glance, but her father\ntold her to come, and they walked together up the park, while I\nhastened before to prepare the servants.",
      "Now, darling,  said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they\nhalted at the bottom of the front steps:  your cousin is not so strong\nor so merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very\nshort time since; therefore, don t expect him to play and run about\nwith you directly.",
      "And don t harass him much by talking: let him be\nquiet this evening, at least, will you?",
      "Yes, yes, papa,  answered Catherine:  but I do want to see him; and he\nhasn t once looked out.",
      "The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the\nground by his uncle.",
      "This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,  he said, putting their little\nhands together.",
      "She s fond of you already; and mind you don t grieve\nher by crying to-night.",
      "Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an\nend, and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you\nplease.",
      "Let me go to bed, then,  answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine s\nsalute; and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears.",
      "Come, come, there s a good child,  I whispered, leading him in.",
      "You ll make her weep too see how sorry she is for you!",
      "I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as\nsad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.",
      "All three\nentered, and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.",
      "I\nproceeded to remove Linton s cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair\nby the table; but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.",
      "My master inquired what was the matter.",
      "I can t sit on a chair,  sobbed the boy.",
      "Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,  answered\nhis uncle patiently.",
      "He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his\nfretful ailing charge.",
      "Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.",
      "Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.",
      "At first she sat\nsilent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her\nlittle cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking\nhis curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,\nlike a baby.",
      "This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his\neyes, and lightened into a faint smile.",
      "Oh, he ll do very well,  said the master to me, after watching them a\nminute.",
      "Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.",
      "The company of a child\nof his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for\nstrength he ll gain it.",
      "Ay, if we can keep him!",
      "I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came\nover me that there was slight hope of that.",
      "And then, I thought, how\never will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?",
      "Between his father\nand Hareton, what playmates and instructors they ll be.",
      "Our doubts were\npresently decided even earlier than I expected.",
      "I had just taken the\nchildren upstairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep he\nwould not suffer me to leave him till that was the case I had come\ndown, and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom\ncandle for Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and\ninformed me that Mr. Heathcliff s servant Joseph was at the door, and\nwished to speak with the master.",
      "I shall ask him what he wants first,  I said, in considerable\ntrepidation.",
      "A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the\ninstant they have returned from a long journey.",
      "I don t think the\nmaster can see him.",
      "Joseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and\nnow presented himself in the hall.",
      "He was donned in his Sunday\ngarments, with his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding\nhis hat in one hand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean\nhis shoes on the mat.",
      "Good-evening, Joseph,  I said, coldly.",
      "What business brings you here\nto-night?",
      "It s Maister Linton I mun spake to,  he answered, waving me\ndisdainfully aside.",
      "Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to\nsay, I m sure he won t hear it now,  I continued.",
      "You had better sit\ndown in there, and entrust your message to me.",
      "Which is his rahm?",
      "pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed\ndoors.",
      "I perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I\nwent up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor,\nadvising that he should be dismissed till next day.",
      "Mr. Linton had no\ntime to empower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and,\npushing into the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the\ntable, with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began\nin an elevated tone, as if anticipating opposition \n\n Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn t goa back  bout him.",
      "Edgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow\novercast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own\naccount; but, recalling Isabella s hopes and fears, and anxious wishes\nfor her son, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved\nbitterly at the prospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart\nhow it might be avoided.",
      "No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of\nany desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more\nperemptory: there was nothing left but to resign him.",
      "However, he was\nnot going to rouse him from his sleep.",
      "Tell Mr. Heathcliff,  he answered calmly,  that his son shall come to\nWuthering Heights to-morrow.",
      "He is in bed, and too tired to go the\ndistance now.",
      "You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired\nhim to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is\nvery precarious.",
      "Noa!",
      "said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and\nassuming an authoritative air.",
      "Noa!",
      "that means naught.",
      "Hathecliff maks\nnoa  count o  t  mother, nor ye norther; but he ll hev his lad; und I\nmun tak  him soa now ye knaw!",
      "You shall not to-night!",
      "answered Linton decisively.",
      "Walk down stairs\nat once, and repeat to your master what I have said.",
      "Ellen, show him\ndown.",
      "Go \n\nAnd, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room\nof him and closed the door.",
      "Varrah weell!",
      "shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.",
      "To-morn, he s\ncome hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!",
      "CHAPTER XX\n\n\nTo obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton\ncommissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine s pony; and,\nsaid he As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or\nbad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she\ncannot associate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain\nin ignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious\nto visit the Heights.",
      "Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly,\nand he has been obliged to leave us.",
      "Linton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o clock,\nand astonished to be informed that he must prepare for further\ntravelling; but I softened off the matter by stating that he was going\nto spend some time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see\nhim so much, he did not like to defer the pleasure till he should\nrecover from his late journey.",
      "My father!",
      "he cried, in strange perplexity.",
      "Mamma never told me I\nhad a father.",
      "Where does he live?",
      "I d rather stay with uncle.",
      "He lives a little distance from the Grange,  I replied;  just beyond\nthose hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get\nhearty.",
      "And you should be glad to go home, and to see him.",
      "You must try\nto love him, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.",
      "But why have I not heard of him before?",
      "asked Linton.",
      "Why didn t\nmamma and he live together, as other people do?",
      "He had business to keep him in the north,  I answered,  and your\nmother s health required her to reside in the south.",
      "And why didn t mamma speak to me about him?",
      "persevered the child.",
      "She often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.",
      "How am I\nto love papa?",
      "I don t know him.",
      "Oh, all children love their parents,  I said.",
      "Your mother, perhaps,\nthought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to\nyou.",
      "Let us make haste.",
      "An early ride on such a beautiful morning is\nmuch preferable to an hour s more sleep.",
      "Is _she_ to go with us,  he demanded,  the little girl I saw\nyesterday?",
      "Not now,  replied I.",
      "Is uncle?",
      "he continued.",
      "No, I shall be your companion there,  I said.",
      "Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.",
      "I won t go without uncle,  he cried at length:  I can t tell where you\nmean to take me.",
      "I attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to\nmeet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards\ndressing, and I had to call for my master s assistance in coaxing him\nout of bed.",
      "The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive\nassurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy\nwould visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I\ninvented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.",
      "The pure\nheather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of\nMinny, relieved his despondency after a while.",
      "He began to put\nquestions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater\ninterest and liveliness.",
      "Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?",
      "he\ninquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light\nmist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.",
      "It is not so buried in trees,  I replied,  and it is not quite so\nlarge, but you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air\nis healthier for you fresher and drier.",
      "You will, perhaps, think the\nbuilding old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the\nnext best in the neighbourhood.",
      "And you will have such nice rambles on\nthe moors.",
      "Hareton Earnshaw that is, Miss Cathy s other cousin, and so\nyours in a manner will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can\nbring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,\nnow and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,\nwalk out on the hills.",
      "And what is my father like?",
      "he asked.",
      "Is he as young and handsome as\nuncle?",
      "He s as young,  said I;  but he has black hair and eyes, and looks\nsterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.",
      "He ll not seem to you\nso gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,\nmind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he ll be fonder\nof you than any uncle, for you are his own.",
      "Black hair and eyes!",
      "mused Linton.",
      "I can t fancy him.",
      "Then I am not\nlike him, am I?",
      "Not much,  I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret\nthe white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large\nlanguid eyes his mother s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness\nkindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.",
      "How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!",
      "he\nmurmured.",
      "Has he ever seen me?",
      "If he has, I must have been a baby.",
      "I\nremember not a single thing about him!",
      "Why, Master Linton,  said I,  three hundred miles is a great distance;\nand ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person\ncompared with what they do to you.",
      "It is probable Mr. Heathcliff\nproposed going from summer to summer, but never found a convenient\nopportunity; and now it is too late.",
      "Don t trouble him with questions\non the subject: it will disturb him, for no good.",
      "The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder\nof the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.",
      "I watched\nto catch his impressions in his countenance.",
      "He surveyed the carved\nfront and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and\ncrooked firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his\nprivate feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.",
      "But he had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation\nwithin.",
      "Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.",
      "It was\nhalf-past six; the family had just finished breakfast: the servant was\nclearing and wiping down the table.",
      "Joseph stood by his master s chair\ntelling some tale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing\nfor the hayfield.",
      "Hallo, Nelly!",
      "said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.",
      "I feared I should\nhave to come down and fetch my property myself.",
      "You ve brought it, have\nyou?",
      "Let us see what we can make of it.",
      "He got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping\ncuriosity.",
      "Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the\nthree.",
      "Sure-ly,  said Joseph after a grave inspection,  he s swopped wi  ye,\nMaister, an  yon s his lass!",
      "Heathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a\nscornful laugh.",
      "God!",
      "what a beauty!",
      "what a lovely, charming thing!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "Hav n t they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?",
      "Oh, damn my\nsoul!",
      "but that s worse than I expected and the devil knows I was not\nsanguine!",
      "I bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.",
      "He did\nnot thoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father s speech, or\nwhether it were intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that\nthe grim, sneering stranger was his father.",
      "But he clung to me with\ngrowing trepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff s taking a seat and bidding\nhim  come hither  he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.",
      "Tut, tut!",
      "said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him\nroughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.",
      "None of that nonsense!",
      "We re not going to hurt thee, Linton isn t that\nthy name?",
      "Thou art thy mother s child, entirely!",
      "Where is _my_ share in\nthee, puling chicken?",
      "He took off the boy s cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt\nhis slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton\nceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.",
      "Do you know me?",
      "asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the\nlimbs were all equally frail and feeble.",
      "No,  said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.",
      "You ve heard of me, I daresay?",
      "No,  he replied again.",
      "No!",
      "What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for\nme!",
      "You are my son, then, I ll tell you; and your mother was a wicked\nslut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.",
      "Now, don t wince, and colour up!",
      "Though it _is_ something to see you\nhave not white blood.",
      "Be a good lad; and I ll do for you.",
      "Nelly, if you\nbe tired you may sit down; if not, get home again.",
      "I guess you ll\nreport what you hear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this\nthing won t be settled while you linger about it.",
      "Well,  replied I,  I hope you ll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff,\nor you ll not keep him long; and he s all you have akin in the wide\nworld, that you will ever know remember.",
      "I ll be _very_ kind to him, you needn t fear,  he said, laughing.",
      "Only nobody else must be kind to him: I m jealous of monopolising his\naffection.",
      "And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some\nbreakfast.",
      "Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.",
      "Yes, Nell, \nhe added, when they had departed,  my son is prospective owner of your\nplace, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his\nsuccessor.",
      "Besides, he s _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_\ndescendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children\nto till their fathers  lands for wages.",
      "That is the sole consideration\nwhich can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate\nhim for the memories he revives!",
      "But that consideration is sufficient:\nhe s as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master\ntends his own.",
      "I have a room upstairs, furnished for him in handsome\nstyle; I ve engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from\ntwenty miles  distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.",
      "I ve\nordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I ve arranged everything with\na view to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his\nassociates.",
      "I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the\ntrouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a\nworthy object of pride; and I m bitterly disappointed with the\nwhey-faced, whining wretch!",
      "While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of\nmilk-porridge, and placed it before Linton: who stirred round the\nhomely mess with a look of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it.",
      "I saw the old man-servant shared largely in his master s scorn of the\nchild; though he was compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart,\nbecause Heathcliff plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.",
      "Cannot ate it?",
      "repeated he, peering in Linton s face, and subduing\nhis voice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.",
      "But Maister\nHareton nivir ate naught else, when he wer a little  un; and what wer\ngooid eneugh for him s gooid eneugh for ye, I s rayther think!",
      "I _sha n t_ eat it!",
      "answered Linton, snappishly.",
      "Take it away.",
      "Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.",
      "Is there aught ails th  victuals?",
      "he asked, thrusting the tray under\nHeathcliff s nose.",
      "What should ail them?",
      "he said.",
      "Wah!",
      "answered Joseph,  yon dainty chap says he cannut ate  em.",
      "But I\nguess it s raight!",
      "His mother wer just soa we wer a most too mucky to\nsow t  corn for makking her breead.",
      "Don t mention his mother to me,  said the master, angrily.",
      "Get him\nsomething that he can eat, that s all.",
      "What is his usual food, Nelly?",
      "I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received\ninstructions to prepare some.",
      "Come, I reflected, his father s\nselfishness may contribute to his comfort.",
      "He perceives his delicate\nconstitution, and the necessity of treating him tolerably.",
      "I ll console\nMr. Edgar by acquainting him with the turn Heathcliff s humour has\ntaken.",
      "Having no excuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while\nLinton was engaged in timidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly\nsheep-dog.",
      "But he was too much on the alert to be cheated: as I closed\nthe door, I heard a cry, and a frantic repetition of the words \n\n Don t leave me!",
      "I ll not stay here!",
      "I ll not stay here!",
      "Then the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come\nforth.",
      "I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief\nguardianship ended.",
      "CHAPTER XXI\n\n\nWe had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee,\neager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations\nfollowed the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to\nsoothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however,\n if I can get him ; and there were no hopes of that.",
      "This promise\npoorly pacified her; but time was more potent; and though still at\nintervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before\nshe did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that\nshe did not recognise him.",
      "When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in\npaying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master\ngot on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\nnever to be seen.",
      "I could gather from her that he continued in weak\nhealth, and was a tiresome inmate.",
      "She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\ndislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to\nconceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could\nnot do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes\ntogether.",
      "There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his\nlessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the\nparlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting\ncoughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.",
      "And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,  added the woman;  nor\none so careful of hisseln.",
      "He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open\na bit late in the evening.",
      "Oh!",
      "it s killing, a breath of night air!",
      "And\nhe must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph s bacca-pipe is\npoison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,\nmilk for ever heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;\nand there he ll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the\nfire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and\nif Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him Hareton is not bad-natured,\nthough he s rough they re sure to part, one swearing and the other\ncrying.",
      "I believe the master would relish Earnshaw s thrashing him to a\nmummy, if he were not his son; and I m certain he would be fit to turn\nhim out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln.",
      "But\nthen he won t go into danger of temptation: he never enters the\nparlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he\nsends him upstairs directly.",
      "I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered\nyoung Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so\noriginally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still\nI was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had\nbeen left with us.",
      "Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he\nthought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk\nto see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever\ncame into the village?",
      "She said he had only been twice, on horseback,\naccompanying his father; and both times he pretended to be quite\nknocked up for three or four days afterwards.",
      "That housekeeper left, if\nI recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did\nnot know, was her successor; she lives there still.",
      "Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy\nreached sixteen.",
      "On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested\nany signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late\nmistress s death.",
      "Her father invariably spent that day alone in the\nlibrary; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he\nwould frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.",
      "Therefore Catherine\nwas thrown on her own resources for amusement.",
      "This twentieth of March\nwas a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young\nlady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a\nramble on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave,\nif we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.",
      "So make haste, Ellen!",
      "she cried.",
      "I know where I wish to go; where a\ncolony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made\ntheir nests yet.",
      "That must be a good distance up,  I answered;  they don t breed on the\nedge of the moor.",
      "No, it s not,  she said.",
      "I ve gone very near with papa.",
      "I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the\nmatter.",
      "She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off\nagain like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of\nentertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and\nenjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my\ndelight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright\ncheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes\nradiant with cloudless pleasure.",
      "She was a happy creature, and an\nangel, in those days.",
      "It s a pity she could not be content.",
      "Well,  said I,  where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?",
      "We should be at\nthem: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.",
      "Oh, a little further only a little further, Ellen,  was her answer,\ncontinually.",
      "Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time\nyou reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.",
      "But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at\nlength, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our\nsteps.",
      "I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she\neither did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I\nwas compelled to follow.",
      "Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I\ncame in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights\nthan her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of\nwhom I felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.",
      "Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting\nout the nests of the grouse.",
      "The Heights were Heathcliff s land, and he\nwas reproving the poacher.",
      "I ve neither taken any nor found any,  she said, as I toiled to them,\nexpanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.",
      "I didn t mean\nto take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I\nwished to see the eggs.",
      "Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his\nacquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards\nit, and demanded who  papa  was?",
      "Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,  she replied.",
      "I thought you did not\nknow me, or you wouldn t have spoken in that way.",
      "You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?",
      "he said,\nsarcastically.",
      "And what are you?",
      "inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the\nspeaker.",
      "That man I ve seen before.",
      "Is he your son?",
      "She pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing\nbut increased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his\nage: he seemed as awkward and rough as ever.",
      "Miss Cathy,  I interrupted,  it will be three hours instead of one\nthat we are out, presently.",
      "We really must go back.",
      "No, that man is not my son,  answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.",
      "But I have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your\nnurse is in a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a\nlittle rest.",
      "Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my\nhouse?",
      "You ll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a\nkind welcome.",
      "I whispered Catherine that she mustn t, on any account, accede to the\nproposal: it was entirely out of the question.",
      "Why?",
      "she asked, aloud.",
      "I m tired of running, and the ground is dewy:\nI can t sit here.",
      "Let us go, Ellen.",
      "Besides, he says I have seen his\nson.",
      "He s mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the\nfarmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags.",
      "Don t you?",
      "I do.",
      "Come, Nelly, hold your tongue it will be a treat for her to look\nin on us.",
      "Hareton, get forwards with the lass.",
      "You shall walk with me,\nNelly.",
      "No, she s not going to any such place,  I cried, struggling to release\nmy arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones\nalready, scampering round the brow at full speed.",
      "Her appointed\ncompanion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,\nand vanished.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, it s very wrong,  I continued:  you know you mean no\ngood.",
      "And there she ll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever\nwe return; and I shall have the blame.",
      "I want her to see Linton,  he answered;  he s looking better these few\ndays; it s not often he s fit to be seen.",
      "And we ll soon persuade her\nto keep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?",
      "The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I\nsuffered her to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad\ndesign in encouraging her to do so,  I replied.",
      "My design is as honest as possible.",
      "I ll inform you of its whole\nscope,  he said.",
      "That the two cousins may fall in love, and get\nmarried.",
      "I m acting generously to your master: his young chit has no\nexpectations, and should she second my wishes she ll be provided for at\nonce as joint successor with Linton.",
      "If Linton died,  I answered,  and his life is quite uncertain,\nCatherine would be the heir.",
      "No, she would not,  he said.",
      "There is no clause in the will to secure\nit so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire\ntheir union, and am resolved to bring it about.",
      "And I m resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,  I\nreturned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.",
      "Heathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to\nopen the door.",
      "My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could\nnot exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled\nwhen he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I\nwas foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him\nfrom desiring her injury.",
      "Linton stood on the hearth.",
      "He had been out\nwalking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph\nto bring him dry shoes.",
      "He had grown tall of his age, still wanting\nsome months of sixteen.",
      "His features were pretty yet, and his eye and\ncomplexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely\ntemporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.",
      "Now, who is that?",
      "asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.",
      "Can you\ntell?",
      "Your son?",
      "she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then\nthe other.",
      "Yes, yes,  answered he:  but is this the only time you have beheld\nhim?",
      "Think!",
      "Ah!",
      "you have a short memory.",
      "Linton, don t you recall your\ncousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?",
      "What, Linton!",
      "cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.",
      "Is that little Linton?",
      "He s taller than I am!",
      "Are you Linton?",
      "The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him\nfervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in\nthe appearance of each.",
      "Catherine had reached her full height; her\nfigure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole\naspect sparkling with health and spirits.",
      "Linton s looks and movements\nwere very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace\nin his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not\nunpleasing.",
      "After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his\ncousin went to Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his\nattention between the objects inside and those that lay without:\npretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the\nformer alone.",
      "And you are my uncle, then!",
      "she cried, reaching up to salute him.",
      "I\nthought I liked you, though you were cross at first.",
      "Why don t you\nvisit at the Grange with Linton?",
      "To live all these years such close\nneighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?",
      "I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,  he\nanswered.",
      "There damn it!",
      "If you have any kisses to spare, give them to\nLinton: they are thrown away on me.",
      "Naughty Ellen!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her\nlavish caresses.",
      "Wicked Ellen!",
      "to try to hinder me from entering.",
      "But\nI ll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle?",
      "and\nsometimes bring papa.",
      "Won t you be glad to see us?",
      "Of course,  replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,\nresulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.",
      "But\nstay,  he continued, turning towards the young lady.",
      "Now I think of\nit, I d better tell you.",
      "Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we\nquarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if\nyou mention coming here to him, he ll put a veto on your visits\naltogether.",
      "Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless\nof seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you\nmust not mention it.",
      "Why did you quarrel?",
      "asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.",
      "He thought me too poor to wed his sister,  answered Heathcliff,  and\nwas grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he ll never forgive\nit.",
      "That s wrong!",
      "said the young lady:  some time I ll tell him so.",
      "But\nLinton and I have no share in your quarrel.",
      "I ll not come here, then;\nhe shall come to the Grange.",
      "It will be too far for me,  murmured her cousin:  to walk four miles\nwould kill me.",
      "No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every\nmorning, but once or twice a week.",
      "The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.",
      "I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,  he muttered to me.",
      "Miss\nCatherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send\nhim to the devil.",
      "Now, if it had been Hareton!",
      "Do you know that, twenty\ntimes a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?",
      "I d have loved\nthe lad had he been some one else.",
      "But I think he s safe from _her_\nlove.",
      "I ll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir\nitself briskly.",
      "We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.",
      "Oh, confound the vapid thing!",
      "He s absorbed in drying his feet, and\nnever looks at her.",
      "Linton!",
      "Yes, father,  answered the boy.",
      "Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit\nor a weasel s nest?",
      "Take her into the garden, before you change your\nshoes; and into the stable to see your horse.",
      "Wouldn t you rather sit here?",
      "asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a\ntone which expressed reluctance to move again.",
      "I don t know,  she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and\nevidently eager to be active.",
      "He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.",
      "Heathcliff rose, and\nwent into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for\nHareton.",
      "Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.",
      "The young\nman had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks\nand his wetted hair.",
      "Oh, I ll ask _you_, uncle,  cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the\nhousekeeper s assertion.",
      "That is not my cousin, is he?",
      "Yes,  he replied,  your mother s nephew.",
      "Don t you like him?",
      "Catherine looked queer.",
      "Is he not a handsome lad?",
      "he continued.",
      "The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in\nHeathcliff s ear.",
      "He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very\nsensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his\ninferiority.",
      "But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming \n\n You ll be the favourite among us, Hareton!",
      "She says you are a What was\nit?",
      "Well, something very flattering.",
      "Here!",
      "you go with her round the\nfarm.",
      "And behave like a gentleman, mind!",
      "Don t use any bad words; and\ndon t stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to\nhide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,\nand keep your hands out of your pockets.",
      "Be off, and entertain her as\nnicely as you can.",
      "He watched the couple walking past the window.",
      "Earnshaw had his\ncountenance completely averted from his companion.",
      "He seemed studying\nthe familiar landscape with a stranger s and an artist s interest.",
      "Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.",
      "She then\nturned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself,\nand tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of\nconversation.",
      "I ve tied his tongue,  observed Heathcliff.",
      "He ll not venture a\nsingle syllable all the time!",
      "Nelly, you recollect me at his age nay,\nsome years younger.",
      "Did I ever look so stupid: so  gaumless,  as Joseph\ncalls it?",
      "Worse,  I replied,  because more sullen with it.",
      "I ve a pleasure in him,  he continued, reflecting aloud.",
      "He has\nsatisfied my expectations.",
      "If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it\nhalf so much.",
      "But he s no fool; and I can sympathise with all his\nfeelings, having felt them myself.",
      "I know what he suffers now, for\ninstance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,\nthough.",
      "And he ll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness\nand ignorance.",
      "I ve got him faster than his scoundrel of a father\nsecured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness.",
      "I ve\ntaught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak.",
      "Don t\nyou think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him?",
      "almost as proud as I am of mine.",
      "But there s this difference; one is\ngold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to\nape a service of silver.",
      "_Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I\nshall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.",
      "_His_ had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than\nunavailing.",
      "_I_ have nothing to regret; _he_ would have more than any,\nbut I, are aware of.",
      "And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of\nme!",
      "You ll own that I ve outmatched Hindley there.",
      "If the dead villain\ncould rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring s wrongs, I\nshould have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again,\nindignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the\nworld!",
      "Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.",
      "I made no reply,\nbecause I saw that he expected none.",
      "Meantime, our young companion, who\nsat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms\nof uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat\nof Catherine s society for fear of a little fatigue.",
      "His father\nremarked the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand\nirresolutely extended towards his cap.",
      "Get up, you idle boy!",
      "he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.",
      "Away\nafter them!",
      "they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.",
      "Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.",
      "The lattice was\nopen, and, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable\nattendant what was that inscription over the door?",
      "Hareton stared up,\nand scratched his head like a true clown.",
      "It s some damnable writing,  he answered.",
      "I cannot read it.",
      "Can t read it?",
      "cried Catherine;  I can read it: it s English.",
      "But I\nwant to know why it is there.",
      "Linton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.",
      "He does not know his letters,  he said to his cousin.",
      "Could you\nbelieve in the existence of such a colossal dunce?",
      "Is he all as he should be?",
      "asked Miss Cathy, seriously;  or is he\nsimple: not right?",
      "I ve questioned him twice now, and each time he\nlooked so stupid I think he does not understand me.",
      "I can hardly\nunderstand _him_, I m sure!",
      "Linton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who\ncertainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.",
      "There s nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?",
      "he said.",
      "My cousin fancies you are an idiot.",
      "There you experience the\nconsequence of scorning  book-larning,  as you would say.",
      "Have you\nnoticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?",
      "Why, where the devil is the use on t?",
      "growled Hareton, more ready in\nanswering his daily companion.",
      "He was about to enlarge further, but the\ntwo youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being\ndelighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of\namusement.",
      "Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?",
      "tittered Linton.",
      "Papa told you not to say any bad words, and you can t open your mouth\nwithout one.",
      "Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!",
      "If thou weren t more a lass than a lad, I d fell thee this minute, I\nwould; pitiful lath of a crater!",
      "retorted the angry boor, retreating,\nwhile his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification; for he was\nconscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled\nwhen he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular\naversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the doorway:\nthe boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton s faults and\ndeficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl\nrelishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the\nill-nature they evinced.",
      "I began to dislike, more than to compassionate\nLinton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.",
      "We stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but\nhappily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant\nof our prolonged absence.",
      "As we walked home, I would fain have\nenlightened my charge on the characters of the people we had quitted:\nbut she got it into her head that I was prejudiced against them.",
      "Aha!",
      "she cried,  you take papa s side, Ellen: you are partial I know;\nor else you wouldn t have cheated me so many years into the notion that\nLinton lived a long way from here.",
      "I m really extremely angry; only I m\nso pleased I can t show it!",
      "But you must hold your tongue about my\nuncle; he s _my_ uncle, remember; and I ll scold papa for quarrelling\nwith him.",
      "And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of\nher mistake.",
      "She did not mention the visit that night, because she did\nnot see Mr. Linton.",
      "Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and\nstill I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and\nwarning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.",
      "But he was too\ntimid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun\nconnection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good\nreasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.",
      "Papa!",
      "she exclaimed, after the morning s salutations,  guess whom I\nsaw yesterday, in my walk on the moors.",
      "Ah, papa, you started!",
      "you ve\nnot done right, have you, now?",
      "I saw but listen, and you shall hear how\nI found you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet\npretended to pity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always\ndisappointed about Linton s coming back!",
      "She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and\nmy master, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said\nnothing till she had concluded.",
      "Then he drew her to him, and asked if\nshe knew why he had concealed Linton s near neighbourhood from her?",
      "Could she think it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly\nenjoy?",
      "It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,  she answered.",
      "Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?",
      "he said.",
      "No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because\nMr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to\nwrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest\nopportunity.",
      "I knew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with\nyour cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he\nwould detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else,\nI took precautions that you should not see Linton again.",
      "I meant to\nexplain this some time as you grew older, and I m sorry I delayed it.",
      "But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,  observed Catherine, not\nat all convinced;  and _he_ didn t object to our seeing each other: he\nsaid I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell\nyou, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for\nmarrying aunt Isabella.",
      "And you won t. _You_ are the one to be blamed:\nhe is willing to let _us_ be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you\nare not.",
      "My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her\nuncle-in-law s evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to\nIsabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his\nproperty.",
      "He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for\nthough he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and\ndetestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since\nMrs. Linton s death.",
      "She might have been living yet, if it had not\nbeen for him!",
      "was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes,\nHeathcliff seemed a murderer.",
      "Miss Cathy conversant with no bad deeds\nexcept her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion,\narising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day\nthey were committed was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could\nbrood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its\nplans without a visitation of remorse.",
      "She appeared so deeply impressed\nand shocked at this new view of human nature excluded from all her\nstudies and all her ideas till now that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary\nto pursue the subject.",
      "He merely added:  You will know hereafter,\ndarling, why I wish you to avoid his house and family; now return to\nyour old employments and amusements, and think no more about them.",
      "Catherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a\ncouple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the\ngrounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when\nshe had retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found\nher crying, on her knees by the bedside.",
      "Oh, fie, silly child!",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "If you had any real griefs you d\nbe ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.",
      "You never had\none shadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.",
      "Suppose, for a\nminute, that master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the\nworld: how would you feel, then?",
      "Compare the present occasion with such\nan affliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have,\ninstead of coveting more.",
      "I m not crying for myself, Ellen,  she answered,  it s for him.",
      "He\nexpected to see me again to-morrow, and there he ll be so disappointed:\nand he ll wait for me, and I sha n t come!",
      "Nonsense!",
      "said I,  do you imagine he has thought as much of you as\nyou have of him?",
      "Hasn t he Hareton for a companion?",
      "Not one in a\nhundred would weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for\ntwo afternoons.",
      "Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself\nno further about you.",
      "But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?",
      "she asked,\nrising to her feet.",
      "And just send those books I promised to lend him?",
      "His books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them\nextremely, when I told him how interesting they were.",
      "May I not,\nEllen?",
      "No, indeed!",
      "no, indeed!",
      "replied I with decision.",
      "Then he would write\nto you, and there d never be an end of it.",
      "No, Miss Catherine, the\nacquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see\nthat it is done.",
      "But how can one little note ?",
      "she recommenced, putting on an\nimploring countenance.",
      "Silence!",
      "I interrupted.",
      "We ll not begin with your little notes.",
      "Get\ninto bed.",
      "She threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss\nher good-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great\ndispleasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo!",
      "there\nwas Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and\na pencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my\nentrance.",
      "You ll get nobody to take that, Catherine,  I said,  if you write it;\nand at present I shall put out your candle.",
      "I set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my\nhand and a petulant  cross thing!",
      "I then quitted her again, and she\ndrew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.",
      "The letter was\nfinished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came\nfrom the village; but that I didn t learn till some time afterwards.",
      "Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew\nwondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I\ncame near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the\nbook, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose\npaper sticking out beyond the leaves.",
      "She also got a trick of coming\ndown early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she\nwere expecting the arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in\na cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and\nwhose key she took special care to remove when she left it.",
      "One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings\nand trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into\nbits of folded paper.",
      "My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I\ndetermined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as\nsoon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily\nfound among my house keys one that would fit the lock.",
      "Having opened, I\nemptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to\nexamine at leisure in my own chamber.",
      "Though I could not but suspect, I\nwas still surprised to discover that they were a mass of\ncorrespondence daily almost, it must have been from Linton Heathcliff:\nanswers to documents forwarded by her.",
      "The earlier dated were\nembarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious\nlove-letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet\nwith touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more\nexperienced source.",
      "Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds\nof ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in\nthe affected, wordy style that a schoolboy might use to a fancied,\nincorporeal sweetheart.",
      "Whether they satisfied Cathy I don t know; but\nthey appeared very worthless trash to me.",
      "After turning over as many as\nI thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside,\nrelocking the vacant drawer.",
      "Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the\nkitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain\nlittle boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked\nsomething into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out.",
      "I went\nround by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought\nvalorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I\nsucceeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious\nconsequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall\nand perused Miss Cathy s affectionate composition.",
      "It was more simple\nand more eloquent than her cousin s: very pretty and very silly.",
      "I\nshook my head, and went meditating into the house.",
      "The day being wet,\nshe could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the\nconclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the\ndrawer.",
      "Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had\nsought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain,\nkeeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings.",
      "Never did any bird\nflying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping\nyoung ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and\nflutterings, than she by her single  Oh!",
      "and the change that\ntransfigured her late happy countenance.",
      "Mr. Linton looked up.",
      "What is the matter, love?",
      "Have you hurt yourself?",
      "he said.",
      "His tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the\nhoard.",
      "No, papa!",
      "she gasped.",
      "Ellen!",
      "Ellen!",
      "come upstairs I m sick!",
      "I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.",
      "Oh, Ellen!",
      "you have got them,  she commenced immediately, dropping on\nher knees, when we were enclosed alone.",
      "Oh, give them to me, and I ll\nnever, never do so again!",
      "Don t tell papa.",
      "You have not told papa,\nEllen?",
      "say you have not?",
      "I ve been exceedingly naughty, but I won t do\nit any more!",
      "With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.",
      "So,  I exclaimed,  Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:\nyou may well be ashamed of them!",
      "A fine bundle of trash you study in\nyour leisure hours, to be sure: why, it s good enough to be printed!",
      "And what do you suppose the master will think when I display it before\nhim?",
      "I hav n t shown it yet, but you needn t imagine I shall keep your\nridiculous secrets.",
      "For shame!",
      "and you must have led the way in writing\nsuch absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I m certain.",
      "I didn t!",
      "I didn t!",
      "sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart.",
      "I didn t\nonce think of loving him till \n\n _Loving_!",
      "cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.",
      "_Loving_!",
      "Did anybody ever hear the like!",
      "I might just as well talk of\nloving the miller who comes once a year to buy our corn.",
      "Pretty loving,\nindeed!",
      "and both times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours\nin your life!",
      "Now here is the babyish trash.",
      "I m going with it to the\nlibrary; and we ll see what your father says to such _loving_.",
      "She sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and\nthen she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn\nthem do anything rather than show them.",
      "And being really fully as much\ninclined to laugh as scold for I esteemed it all girlish vanity I at\nlength relented in a measure, and asked, If I consent to burn them,\nwill you promise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again,\nnor a book (for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair,\nnor rings, nor playthings?",
      "We don t send playthings,  cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her\nshame.",
      "Nor anything at all, then, my lady?",
      "I said.",
      "Unless you will, here I\ngo.",
      "I promise, Ellen!",
      "she cried, catching my dress.",
      "Oh, put them in the\nfire, do, do!",
      "But when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was\ntoo painful to be borne.",
      "She earnestly supplicated that I would spare\nher one or two.",
      "One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton s sake!",
      "I unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an\nangle, and the flame curled up the chimney.",
      "I will have one, you cruel wretch!",
      "she screamed, darting her hand\ninto the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the\nexpense of her fingers.",
      "Very well and I will have some to exhibit to papa!",
      "I answered,\nshaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.",
      "She emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to\nfinish the immolation.",
      "It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and\ninterred them under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a\nsense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment.",
      "I descended\nto tell my master that the young lady s qualm of sickness was almost\ngone, but I judged it best for her to lie down a while.",
      "She wouldn t\ndine; but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and\nmarvellously subdued in outward aspect.",
      "Next morning I answered the\nletter by a slip of paper, inscribed,  Master Heathcliff is requested\nto send no more notes to Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.",
      "And, thenceforth, the little boy came with vacant pockets.",
      "CHAPTER XXII\n\n\nSummer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but\nthe harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still\nuncleared.",
      "Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among\nthe reapers; at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk,\nand the evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad\ncold, that settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors\nthroughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.",
      "Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably\nsadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her\nreading less, and taking more exercise.",
      "She had his companionship no\nlonger; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,\nwith mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or\nthree hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her\nfootsteps, and then my society was obviously less desirable than his.",
      "On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November a fresh watery\nafternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered\nleaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds dark grey\nstreamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain I\nrequested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of\nshowers.",
      "She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my\numbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a\nformal walk which she generally affected if low-spirited and that she\ninvariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing\nnever known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from\nhis increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.",
      "She went\nsadly on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind\nmight well have tempted her to race.",
      "And often, from the side of my\neye, I could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her\ncheek.",
      "I gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.",
      "On one side\nof the road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks,\nwith their roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too\nloose for the latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly\nhorizontal.",
      "In summer Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these\ntrunks, and sit in the branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground;\nand I, pleased with her agility and her light, childish heart, still\nconsidered it proper to scold every time I caught her at such an\nelevation, but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending.",
      "From dinner to tea she would lie in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing\nnothing except singing old songs my nursery lore to herself, or\nwatching the birds, joint tenants, feed and entice their young ones to\nfly: or nestling with closed lids, half thinking, half dreaming,\nhappier than words can express.",
      "Look, Miss!",
      "I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one\ntwisted tree.",
      "Winter is not here yet.",
      "There s a little flower up\nyonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those\nturf steps in July with a lilac mist.",
      "Will you clamber up, and pluck it\nto show to papa?",
      "Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy\nshelter, and replied, at length No, I ll not touch it: but it looks\nmelancholy, does it not, Ellen?",
      "Yes,  I observed,  about as starved and sackless as you: your cheeks\nare bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.",
      "You re so low, I\ndaresay I shall keep up with you.",
      "No,  she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals\nto muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus\nspreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever\nand anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.",
      "Catherine, why are you crying, love?",
      "I asked, approaching and putting\nmy arm over her shoulder.",
      "You mustn t cry because papa has a cold; be\nthankful it is nothing worse.",
      "She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled\nby sobs.",
      "Oh, it _will_ be something worse,  she said.",
      "And what shall I do when\npapa and you leave me, and I am by myself?",
      "I can t forget your words,\nEllen; they are always in my ear.",
      "How life will be changed, how dreary\nthe world will be, when papa and you are dead.",
      "None can tell whether you won t die before us,  I replied.",
      "It s wrong\nto anticipate evil.",
      "We ll hope there are years and years to come before\nany of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.",
      "My mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.",
      "And suppose Mr.\nLinton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you\nhave counted, Miss.",
      "And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity\nabove twenty years beforehand?",
      "But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,  she remarked, gazing up with\ntimid hope to seek further consolation.",
      "Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,  I replied.",
      "She wasn t\nas happy as Master: she hadn t as much to live for.",
      "All you need do, is\nto wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you\ncheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that,\nCathy!",
      "I ll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and\nreckless, and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a\nperson who would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to\ndiscover that you fretted over the separation he has judged it\nexpedient to make.",
      "I fret about nothing on earth except papa s illness,  answered my\ncompanion.",
      "I care for nothing in comparison with papa.",
      "And I ll\nnever never oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word\nto vex him.",
      "I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by\nthis: I pray every night that I may live after him; because I would\nrather be miserable than that he should be: that proves I love him\nbetter than myself.",
      "Good words,  I replied.",
      "But deeds must prove it also; and after he is\nwell, remember you don t forget resolutions formed in the hour of\nfear.",
      "As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young\nlady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on\nthe top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed\nscarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the\nhighway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could\ntouch the upper, except from Cathy s present station.",
      "In stretching to\npull them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed\nscrambling down to recover it.",
      "I bid her be cautious lest she got a\nfall, and she nimbly disappeared.",
      "But the return was no such easy\nmatter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rosebushes\nand blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.",
      "I, like a fool, didn t recollect that, till I heard her laughing and\nexclaiming Ellen!",
      "you ll have to fetch the key, or else I must run\nround to the porter s lodge.",
      "I can t scale the ramparts on this side!",
      "Stay where you are,  I answered;  I have my bundle of keys in my\npocket: perhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I ll go.",
      "Catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while\nI tried all the large keys in succession.",
      "I had applied the last, and\nfound that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain\nthere, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an\napproaching sound arrested me.",
      "It was the trot of a horse; Cathy s\ndance stopped also.",
      "Who is that?",
      "I whispered.",
      "Ellen, I wish you could open the door,  whispered back my companion,\nanxiously.",
      "Ho, Miss Linton!",
      "cried a deep voice (the rider s),  I m glad to meet\nyou.",
      "Don t be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and\nobtain.",
      "I sha n t speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,  answered Catherine.",
      "Papa\nsays you are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says\nthe same.",
      "That is nothing to the purpose,  said Heathcliff.",
      "(He it was.)",
      "I\ndon t hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand\nyour attention.",
      "Yes; you have cause to blush.",
      "Two or three months\nsince, were you not in the habit of writing to Linton?",
      "making love in\nplay, eh?",
      "You deserved, both of you, flogging for that!",
      "You especially,\nthe elder; and less sensitive, as it turns out.",
      "I ve got your letters,\nand if you give me any pertness I ll send them to your father.",
      "I\npresume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it, didn t you?",
      "Well, you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond.",
      "He was in\nearnest: in love, really.",
      "As true as I live, he s dying for you;\nbreaking his heart at your fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.",
      "Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks, and I have\nused more serious measures, and attempted to frighten him out of his\nidiocy, he gets worse daily; and he ll be under the sod before summer,\nunless you restore him!",
      "How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?",
      "I called from the\ninside.",
      "Pray ride on!",
      "How can you deliberately get up such paltry\nfalsehoods?",
      "Miss Cathy, I ll knock the lock off with a stone: you won t\nbelieve that vile nonsense.",
      "You can feel in yourself it is impossible\nthat a person should die for love of a stranger.",
      "I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,  muttered the detected\nvillain.",
      "Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don t like your\ndouble-dealing,  he added aloud.",
      "How could _you_ lie so glaringly as\nto affirm I hated the  poor child ?",
      "and invent bugbear stories to\nterrify her from my door-stones?",
      "Catherine Linton (the very name warms\nme), my bonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if I\nhave not spoken truth: do, there s a darling!",
      "Just imagine your father\nin my place, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your\ncareless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your\nfather himself entreated him; and don t, from pure stupidity, fall into\nthe same error.",
      "I swear, on my salvation, he s going to his grave, and\nnone but you can save him!",
      "The lock gave way and I issued out.",
      "I swear Linton is dying,  repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.",
      "And grief and disappointment are hastening his death.",
      "Nelly, if you\nwon t let her go, you can walk over yourself.",
      "But I shall not return\ntill this time next week; and I think your master himself would\nscarcely object to her visiting her cousin.",
      "Come in,  said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to\nre-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of\nthe speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.",
      "He pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed \n\n Miss Catherine, I ll own to you that I have little patience with\nLinton; and Hareton and Joseph have less.",
      "I ll own that he s with a\nharsh set.",
      "He pines for kindness, as well as love; and a kind word from\nyou would be his best medicine.",
      "Don t mind Mrs. Dean s cruel cautions;\nbut be generous, and contrive to see him.",
      "He dreams of you day and\nnight, and cannot be persuaded that you don t hate him, since you\nneither write nor call.",
      "I closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in\nholding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for\nthe rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and\nwarned us to avoid delay.",
      "Our hurry prevented any comment on the\nencounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined\ninstinctively that Catherine s heart was clouded now in double\ndarkness.",
      "Her features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she\nevidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true.",
      "The master had retired to rest before we came in.",
      "Cathy stole to his\nroom to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.",
      "She returned, and\nasked me to sit with her in the library.",
      "We took our tea together; and\nafterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she\nwas weary.",
      "I got a book, and pretended to read.",
      "As soon as she supposed\nme absorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it\nappeared, at present, her favourite diversion.",
      "I suffered her to enjoy\nit a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.\nHeathcliff s assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would\ncoincide.",
      "Alas!",
      "I hadn t skill to counteract the effect his account had\nproduced: it was just what he intended.",
      "You may be right, Ellen,  she answered;  but I shall never feel at\nease till I know.",
      "And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I\ndon t write, and convince him that I shall not change.",
      "What use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?",
      "We\nparted that night hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to\nWuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress s pony.",
      "I\ncouldn t bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected\ncountenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that\nLinton himself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the\ntale was founded on fact.",
      "CHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThe rainy night had ushered in a misty morning half frost, half\ndrizzle and temporary brooks crossed our path gurgling from the\nuplands.",
      "My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly\nthe humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.",
      "We\nentered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.\nHeathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own\naffirmation.",
      "Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring\nfire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces\nof toasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.",
      "Catherine\nran to the hearth to warm herself.",
      "I asked if the master was in?",
      "My\nquestion remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had\ngrown deaf, and repeated it louder.",
      "Na ay!",
      "he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.",
      "Na ay!",
      "yah\nmuh goa back whear yah coom frough.",
      "Joseph!",
      "cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner\nroom.",
      "How often am I to call you?",
      "There are only a few red ashes now.",
      "Joseph!",
      "come this moment.",
      "Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no\near for this appeal.",
      "The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one\ngone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.",
      "We knew\nLinton s tones, and entered.",
      "Oh, I hope you ll die in a garret, starved to death!",
      "said the boy,\nmistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.",
      "He stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.",
      "Is that you, Miss Linton?",
      "he said, raising his head from the arm of\nthe great chair, in which he reclined.",
      "No don t kiss me: it takes my\nbreath.",
      "Dear me!",
      "Papa said you would call,  continued he, after\nrecovering a little from Catherine s embrace; while she stood by\nlooking very contrite.",
      "Will you shut the door, if you please?",
      "you left\nit open; and those those _detestable_ creatures won t bring coals to\nthe fire.",
      "It s so cold!",
      "I stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.",
      "The invalid\ncomplained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough,\nand looked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.",
      "Well, Linton,  murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,\n are you glad to see me?",
      "Can I do you any good?",
      "Why didn t you come before?",
      "he asked.",
      "You should have come, instead\nof writing.",
      "It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.",
      "I d far\nrather have talked to you.",
      "Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor\nanything else.",
      "I wonder where Zillah is!",
      "Will you  (looking at me)\n step into the kitchen and see?",
      "I had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to\nrun to and fro at his behest, I replied \n\n Nobody is out there but Joseph.",
      "I want to drink,  he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.",
      "Zillah is\nconstantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it s miserable!",
      "And I m obliged to come down here they resolved never to hear me\nupstairs.",
      "Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?",
      "I asked,\nperceiving Catherine to be checked in her friendly advances.",
      "Attentive?",
      "He makes _them_ a little more attentive at least,  he\ncried.",
      "The wretches!",
      "Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton\nlaughs at me!",
      "I hate him!",
      "indeed, I hate them all: they are odious\nbeings.",
      "Cathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the\ndresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.",
      "He bid her add a spoonful of\nwine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,\nappeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.",
      "And are you glad to see me?",
      "asked she, reiterating her former\nquestion, and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.",
      "Yes, I am.",
      "It s something new to hear a voice like yours!",
      "he replied.",
      "But I have been vexed, because you wouldn t come.",
      "And papa swore it\nwas owing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;\nand said you despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be\nmore the master of the Grange than your father by this time.",
      "But you\ndon t despise me, do you, Miss ?",
      "I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,  interrupted my young lady.",
      "Despise you?",
      "No!",
      "Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than\nanybody living.",
      "I don t love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not\ncome when he returns: will he stay away many days?",
      "Not many,  answered Linton;  but he goes on to the moors frequently,\nsince the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two\nwith me in his absence.",
      "Do say you will.",
      "I think I should not be\npeevish with you: you d not provoke me, and you d always be ready to\nhelp me, wouldn t you?",
      "Yes,  said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair,  if I could only\nget papa s consent, I d spend half my time with you.",
      "Pretty Linton!",
      "I\nwish you were my brother.",
      "And then you would like me as well as your father?",
      "observed he, more\ncheerfully.",
      "But papa says you would love me better than him and all\nthe world, if you were my wife; so I d rather you were that.",
      "No, I should never love anybody better than papa,  she returned\ngravely.",
      "And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters\nand brothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and\npapa would be as fond of you as he is of me.",
      "Linton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed\nthey did, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father s aversion to\nher aunt.",
      "I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.",
      "I couldn t\nsucceed till everything she knew was out.",
      "Master Heathcliff, much\nirritated, asserted her relation was false.",
      "Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,  she answered pertly.",
      "_My_ papa scorns yours!",
      "cried Linton.",
      "He calls him a sneaking fool.",
      "Yours is a wicked man,  retorted Catherine;  and you are very naughty\nto dare to repeat what he says.",
      "He must be wicked to have made Aunt\nIsabella leave him as she did.",
      "She didn t leave him,  said the boy;  you sha n t contradict me.",
      "She did,  cried my young lady.",
      "Well, I ll tell _you_ something!",
      "said Linton.",
      "Your mother hated your\nfather: now then.",
      "Oh!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.",
      "And she loved mine,  added he.",
      "You little liar!",
      "I hate you now!",
      "she panted, and her face grew red\nwith passion.",
      "She did!",
      "she did!",
      "sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,\nand leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other\ndisputant, who stood behind.",
      "Hush, Master Heathcliff!",
      "I said;  that s your father s tale, too, I\nsuppose.",
      "It isn t: you hold your tongue!",
      "he answered.",
      "She did, she did,\nCatherine!",
      "she did, she did!",
      "Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to\nfall against one arm.",
      "He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough\nthat soon ended his triumph.",
      "It lasted so long that it frightened even\nme.",
      "As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the\nmischief she had done: though she said nothing.",
      "I held him till the fit\nexhausted itself.",
      "Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down\nsilently.",
      "Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat\nopposite, and looked solemnly into the fire.",
      "How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?",
      "I inquired, after waiting ten\nminutes.",
      "I wish _she_ felt as I do,  he replied:  spiteful, cruel thing!",
      "Hareton never touches me: he never struck me in his life.",
      "And I was\nbetter to-day: and there  his voice died in a whimper.",
      "_I_ didn t strike you!",
      "muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent\nanother burst of emotion.",
      "He sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for\na quarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for\nwhenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and\npathos into the inflexions of his voice.",
      "I m sorry I hurt you, Linton,  she said at length, racked beyond\nendurance.",
      "But _I_ couldn t have been hurt by that little push, and I\nhad no idea that you could, either: you re not much, are you, Linton?",
      "Don t let me go home thinking I ve done you harm.",
      "Answer!",
      "speak to me.",
      "I can t speak to you,  he murmured;  you ve hurt me so that I shall\nlie awake all night choking with this cough.",
      "If you had it you d know\nwhat it was; but _you ll_ be comfortably asleep while I m in agony, and\nnobody near me.",
      "I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful\nnights!",
      "And he began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.",
      "Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,  I said,  it\nwon t be Miss who spoils your ease: you d be the same had she never\ncome.",
      "However, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you ll get\nquieter when we leave you.",
      "Must I go?",
      "asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him.",
      "Do you want\nme to go, Linton?",
      "You can t alter what you ve done,  he replied pettishly, shrinking\nfrom her,  unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a\nfever.",
      "Well, then, I must go?",
      "she repeated.",
      "Let me alone, at least,  said he;  I can t bear your talking.",
      "She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome\nwhile; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a\nmovement to the door, and I followed.",
      "We were recalled by a scream.",
      "Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing\nin the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined\nto be as grievous and harassing as it can.",
      "I thoroughly gauged his\ndisposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to\nattempt humouring him.",
      "Not so my companion: she ran back in terror,\nknelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet\nfrom lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.",
      "I shall lift him on to the settle,  I said,  and he may roll about as\nhe pleases: we can t stop to watch him.",
      "I hope you are satisfied, Miss\nCathy, that _you_ are not the person to benefit him; and that his\ncondition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.",
      "Now, then,\nthere he is!",
      "Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care\nfor his nonsense, he ll be glad to lie still.",
      "She placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he\nrejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a\nstone or a block of wood.",
      "She tried to put it more comfortably.",
      "I can t do with that,  he said;  it s not high enough.",
      "Catherine brought another to lay above it.",
      "That s _too_ high,  murmured the provoking thing.",
      "How must I arrange it, then?",
      "she asked despairingly.",
      "He twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and\nconverted her shoulder into a support.",
      "No, that won t do,  I said.",
      "You ll be content with the cushion,\nMaster Heathcliff.",
      "Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we\ncannot remain five minutes longer.",
      "Yes, yes, we can!",
      "replied Cathy.",
      "He s good and patient now.",
      "He s\nbeginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will\nto-night, if I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare\nnot come again.",
      "Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn t come, if\nI have hurt you.",
      "You must come, to cure me,  he answered.",
      "You ought to come, because\nyou have hurt me: you know you have extremely!",
      "I was not as ill when\nyou entered as I am at present was I?",
      "But you ve made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.",
      "I\ndidn t do it all,  said his cousin.",
      "However, we ll be friends now.",
      "And\nyou want me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?",
      "I told you I did,  he replied impatiently.",
      "Sit on the settle and let\nme lean on your knee.",
      "That s as mamma used to do, whole afternoons\ntogether.",
      "Sit quite still and don t talk: but you may sing a song, if\nyou can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad one of\nthose you promised to teach me; or a story.",
      "I d rather have a ballad,\nthough: begin.",
      "Catherine repeated the longest she could remember.",
      "The employment\npleased both mightily.",
      "Linton would have another, and after that\nanother, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on\nuntil the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,\nreturning for his dinner.",
      "And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?",
      "asked young\nHeathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.",
      "No,  I answered,  nor next day neither.",
      "She, however, gave a\ndifferent response evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped\nand whispered in his ear.",
      "You won t go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!",
      "I commenced, when we were\nout of the house.",
      "You are not dreaming of it, are you?",
      "She smiled.",
      "Oh, I ll take good care,  I continued:  I ll have that lock mended,\nand you can escape by no way else.",
      "I can get over the wall,  she said laughing.",
      "The Grange is not a\nprison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.",
      "And besides, I m almost\nseventeen: I m a woman.",
      "And I m certain Linton would recover quickly if\nhe had me to look after him.",
      "I m older than he is, you know, and wiser:\nless childish, am I not?",
      "And he ll soon do as I direct him, with some\nslight coaxing.",
      "He s a pretty little darling when he s good.",
      "I d make\nsuch a pet of him, if he were mine.",
      "We should never quarrel, should we,\nafter we were used to each other?",
      "Don t you like him, Ellen?",
      "Like him!",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that\never struggled into its teens.",
      "Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,\nhe ll not win twenty.",
      "I doubt whether he ll see spring, indeed.",
      "And\nsmall loss to his family whenever he drops off.",
      "And lucky it is for us\nthat his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious\nand selfish he d be.",
      "I m glad you have no chance of having him for a\nhusband, Miss Catherine.",
      "My companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.",
      "To speak of his\ndeath so regardlessly wounded her feelings.",
      "He s younger than I,  she answered, after a protracted pause of\nmeditation,  and he ought to live the longest: he will he must live as\nlong as I do.",
      "He s as strong now as when he first came into the north;\nI m positive of that.",
      "It s only a cold that ails him, the same as papa\nhas.",
      "You say papa will get better, and why shouldn t he?",
      "Well, well,  I cried,  after all, we needn t trouble ourselves; for\nlisten, Miss, and mind, I ll keep my word, if you attempt going to\nWuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,\nand, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be\nrevived.",
      "It has been revived,  muttered Cathy, sulkily.",
      "Must not be continued, then,  I said.",
      "We ll see,  was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to\ntoil in the rear.",
      "We both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had\nbeen wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no\nexplanation of our absence.",
      "As soon as I entered I hastened to change\nmy soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights\nhad done the mischief.",
      "On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and\nduring three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties:\na calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am\nthankful to say, since.",
      "My little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and\ncheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.",
      "It is\nwearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for\ncomplaint than I had.",
      "The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton s room she\nappeared at my bedside.",
      "Her day was divided between us; no amusement\nusurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play;\nand she was the fondest nurse that ever watched.",
      "She must have had a\nwarm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.",
      "I said\nher days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I\ngenerally needed nothing after six o clock, thus the evening was her\nown.",
      "Poor thing!",
      "I never considered what she did with herself after\ntea.",
      "And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I\nremarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender\nfingers, instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across\nthe moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.",
      "CHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAt the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move\nabout the house.",
      "And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the\nevening I asked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak.",
      "We\nwere in the library, the master having gone to bed: she consented,\nrather unwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not\nsuit her, I bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.",
      "She selected one of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about\nan hour; then came frequent questions.",
      "Ellen, are not you tired?",
      "Hadn t you better lie down now?",
      "You ll be\nsick, keeping up so long, Ellen.",
      "No, no, dear, I m not tired,  I returned, continually.",
      "Perceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her\ndisrelish for her occupation.",
      "It changed to yawning, and stretching,\nand \n\n Ellen, I m tired.",
      "Give over then and talk,  I answered.",
      "That was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till\neight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;\njudging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she\ninflicted on her eyes.",
      "The following night she seemed more impatient\nstill; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a\nheadache, and left me.",
      "I thought her conduct odd; and having remained\nalone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were\nbetter, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of upstairs\nin the dark.",
      "No Catherine could I discover upstairs, and none below.",
      "The servants affirmed they had not seen her.",
      "I listened at Mr. Edgar s\ndoor; all was silence.",
      "I returned to her apartment, extinguished my\ncandle, and seated myself in the window.",
      "The moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I\nreflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk\nabout the garden, for refreshment.",
      "I did detect a figure creeping along\nthe inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its\nemerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms.",
      "He stood a\nconsiderable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds;\nthen started off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and\nreappeared presently, leading Miss s pony; and there she was, just\ndismounted, and walking by its side.",
      "The man took his charge stealthily\nacross the grass towards the stable.",
      "Cathy entered by the\ncasement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where\nI awaited her.",
      "She put the door gently to, slipped off her snowy\nshoes, untied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage,\nto lay aside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.",
      "The\nsurprise petrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate\nexclamation, and stood fixed.",
      "My dear Miss Catherine,  I began, too vividly impressed by her recent\nkindness to break into a scold,  where have you been riding out at this\nhour?",
      "And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?",
      "Where\nhave you been?",
      "Speak!",
      "To the bottom of the park,  she stammered.",
      "I didn t tell a tale.",
      "And nowhere else?",
      "I demanded.",
      "No,  was the muttered reply.",
      "Oh, Catherine!",
      "I cried, sorrowfully.",
      "You know you have been doing\nwrong, or you wouldn t be driven to uttering an untruth to me.",
      "That\ndoes grieve me.",
      "I d rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a\ndeliberate lie.",
      "She sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my\nneck.",
      "Well, Ellen, I m so afraid of you being angry,  she said.",
      "Promise not\nto be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.",
      "We sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold,\nwhatever her secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she\ncommenced \n\n I ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I ve never missed going a\nday since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left\nyour room.",
      "I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every\nevening, and to put her back in the stable: you mustn t scold _him_\neither, mind.",
      "I was at the Heights by half-past six, and generally\nstayed till half-past eight, and then galloped home.",
      "It was not to\namuse myself that I went: I was often wretched all the time.",
      "Now and\nthen I was happy: once in a week perhaps.",
      "At first, I expected there\nwould be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton: for\nI had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you\nstayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble.",
      "While Michael\nwas refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got\npossession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit\nhim, because he was sick, and couldn t come to the Grange; and how papa\nwould object to my going: and then I negotiated with him about the\npony.",
      "He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get\nmarried; so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library,\nto do what I wished: but I preferred giving him my own, and that\nsatisfied him better.",
      "On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that\nis their housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us\nthat, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was\noff with his dogs robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard\nafterwards we might do what we liked.",
      "She brought me some warm wine and\ngingerbread, and appeared exceedingly good-natured; and Linton sat in\nthe arm-chair, and I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone,\nand we laughed and talked so merrily, and found so much to say: we\nplanned where we would go, and what we would do in summer.",
      "I needn t\nrepeat that, because you would call it silly.",
      "One time, however, we were near quarrelling.",
      "He said the pleasantest\nmanner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening\non a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming\ndreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,\nand the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.",
      "That\nwas his most perfect idea of heaven s happiness: mine was rocking in a\nrustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds\nflitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and\nblackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side,\nand the moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but\nclose by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze;\nand woods and sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with\njoy.",
      "He wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to\nsparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee.",
      "I said his heaven would be\nonly half alive; and he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall\nasleep in his; and he said he could not breathe in mine, and began to\ngrow very snappish.",
      "At last, we agreed to try both, as soon as the\nright weather came; and then we kissed each other and were friends.",
      "After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its\nsmooth uncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in,\nif we removed the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help\nus, and we d have a game at blindman s-buff; she should try to catch\nus: you used to, you know, Ellen.",
      "He wouldn t: there was no pleasure in\nit, he said; but he consented to play at ball with me.",
      "We found two in\na cupboard, among a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores\nand shuttlecocks.",
      "One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have\nthe C., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for\nHeathcliff, his name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn t\nlike it.",
      "I beat him constantly; and he got cross again, and coughed,\nand returned to his chair.",
      "That night, though, he easily recovered his\ngood humour: he was charmed with two or three pretty songs _your_\nsongs, Ellen; and when I was obliged to go, he begged and entreated me\nto come the following evening; and I promised.",
      "Minny and I went flying\nhome as light as air; and I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet,\ndarling cousin, till morning.",
      "On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly\nthat I wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was\nbeautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared.",
      "I\nshall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what\ndelights me more, my pretty Linton will.",
      "I trotted up their garden, and\nwas turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took\nmy bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.",
      "He patted Minny s\nneck, and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me\nto speak to him.",
      "I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it\nwould kick him.",
      "He answered in his vulgar accent,  It wouldn t do mitch\nhurt if it did;  and surveyed its legs with a smile.",
      "I was half\ninclined to make it try; however, he moved off to open the door, and,\nas he raised the latch, he looked up to the inscription above, and\nsaid, with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation:  Miss\nCatherine!",
      "I can read yon, now.",
      "Wonderful,  I exclaimed.",
      "Pray let us hear you you _are_ grown\nclever!",
      "He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name Hareton Earnshaw.",
      "And the figures?",
      "I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to\na dead halt.",
      "I cannot tell them yet,  he answered.",
      "Oh, you dunce!",
      "I said, laughing heartily at his failure.",
      "The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl\ngathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in\nmy mirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really\nwas, contempt.",
      "I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity\nand desiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.",
      "He\nreddened I saw that by the moonlight dropped his hand from the latch,\nand skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.",
      "He imagined himself to\nbe as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own\nname; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn t think the same.",
      "Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!",
      "I interrupted.",
      "I shall not scold, but I\ndon t like your conduct there.",
      "If you had remembered that Hareton was\nyour cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how\nimproper it was to behave in that way.",
      "At least, it was praiseworthy\nambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and\nprobably he did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed\nof his ignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it\nand please you.",
      "To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad\nbreeding.",
      "Had _you_ been brought up in his circumstances, would you be\nless rude?",
      "He was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were;\nand I m hurt that he should be despised now, because that base\nHeathcliff has treated him so unjustly.",
      "Well, Ellen, you won t cry about it, will you?",
      "she exclaimed,\nsurprised at my earnestness.",
      "But wait, and you shall hear if he conned\nhis A B C to please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the\nbrute.",
      "I entered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to\nwelcome me.",
      "I m ill to-night, Catherine, love,  he said;  and you must have all\nthe talk, and let me listen.",
      "Come, and sit by me.",
      "I was sure you\nwouldn t break your word, and I ll make you promise again, before you\ngo.",
      "I knew now that I mustn t tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly\nand put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.",
      "I had\nbrought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little\nof one, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open:\nhaving gathered venom with reflection.",
      "He advanced direct to us, seized\nLinton by the arm, and swung him off the seat.",
      "Get to thy own room!",
      "he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with\npassion; and his face looked swelled and furious.",
      "Take her there if\nshe comes to see thee: thou shalln t keep me out of this.",
      "Begone wi  ye\nboth!",
      "He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him\ninto the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly\nlonging to knock me down.",
      "I was afraid for a moment, and I let one\nvolume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out.",
      "I heard a\nmalignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious\nJoseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.",
      "I wer sure he d sarve ye out!",
      "He s a grand lad!",
      "He s getten t  raight\nsperrit in him!",
      "_He_ knaws ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t \nmaister yonder Ech, ech, ech!",
      "He made ye skift properly!",
      "Ech, ech,\nech!",
      "Where must we go?",
      "I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old\nwretch s mockery.",
      "Linton was white and trembling.",
      "He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!",
      "he looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into\nan expression of frantic, powerless fury.",
      "He grasped the handle of the\ndoor, and shook it: it was fastened inside.",
      "If you don t let me in, I ll kill you!",
      "If you don t let me in, I ll\nkill you!",
      "he rather shrieked than said.",
      "Devil!",
      "devil!",
      "I ll kill\nyou I ll kill you!",
      "Joseph uttered his croaking laugh again.",
      "Thear, that s t  father!",
      "he cried.",
      "That s father!",
      "We ve allas\nsummut o  either side in us.",
      "Niver heed, Hareton, lad dunnut be\n feard he cannot get at thee!",
      "I took hold of Linton s hands, and tried to pull him away; but he\nshrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed.",
      "At last his cries were\nchoked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and\nhe fell on the ground.",
      "I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and\ncalled for Zillah, as loud as I could.",
      "She soon heard me: she was\nmilking the cows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work,\nshe inquired what there was to do?",
      "I hadn t breath to explain; dragging\nher in, I looked about for Linton.",
      "Earnshaw had come out to examine the\nmischief he had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing\nupstairs.",
      "Zillah and I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top\nof the steps, and said I shouldn t go in: I must go home.",
      "I exclaimed\nthat he had killed Linton, and I _would_ enter.",
      "Joseph locked the door,\nand declared I should do  no sich stuff,  and asked me whether I were\n bahn to be as mad as him.",
      "I stood crying till the housekeeper\nreappeared.",
      "She affirmed he would be better in a bit, but he couldn t\ndo with that shrieking and din; and she took me, and nearly carried me\ninto the house.",
      "Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!",
      "I sobbed and wept so\nthat my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy\nwith stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me  wisht, \nand denying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my\nassertions that I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison\nand hanged, he commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide\nhis cowardly agitation.",
      "Still, I was not rid of him: when at length\nthey compelled me to depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the\npremises, he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road-side, and\nchecked Minny and took hold of me.",
      "Miss Catherine, I m ill grieved,  he began,  but it s rayther too\nbad \n\n I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me.",
      "He\nlet go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more\nthan half out of my senses.",
      "I didn t bid you good-night that evening, and I didn t go to Wuthering\nHeights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely\nexcited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and\nsometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.",
      "On the\nthird day I took courage: at least, I couldn t bear longer suspense,\nand stole off once more.",
      "I went at five o clock, and walked; fancying I\nmight manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton s room,\nunobserved.",
      "However, the dogs gave notice of my approach.",
      "Zillah\nreceived me, and saying  the lad was mending nicely,  showed me into a\nsmall, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I\nbeheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books.",
      "But he\nwould neither speak to me nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen:\nhe has such an unhappy temper.",
      "And what quite confounded me, when he\ndid open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned\nthe uproar, and Hareton was not to blame!",
      "Unable to reply, except\npassionately, I got up and walked from the room.",
      "He sent after me a\nfaint  Catherine!",
      "He did not reckon on being answered so: but I\nwouldn t turn back; and the morrow was the second day on which I stayed\nat home, nearly determined to visit him no more.",
      "But it was so\nmiserable going to bed and getting up, and never hearing anything about\nhim, that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed.",
      "It _had_ appeared wrong to take the journey once; now it seemed wrong\nto refrain.",
      "Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny; I said  Yes, \nand considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills.",
      "I was\nforced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it was no use\ntrying to conceal my presence.",
      "Young master is in the house,  said Zillah, as she saw me making for\nthe parlour.",
      "I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the\nroom directly.",
      "Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking\nup to the fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be\ntrue \n\n As you don t like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to\nhurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last\nmeeting: let us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no\nwish to see me, and that he mustn t invent any more falsehoods on the\nsubject.",
      "Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,  he answered.",
      "You are so\nmuch happier than I am, you ought to be better.",
      "Papa talks enough of my\ndefects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should\ndoubt myself.",
      "I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he\ncalls me, frequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate\neverybody!",
      "I _am_ worthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit,\nalmost always; and, if you choose, you _may_ say good-bye: you ll get\nrid of an annoyance.",
      "Only, Catherine, do me this justice: believe that\nif I might be as sweet, and as kind, and as good as you are, I would\nbe; as willingly, and more so, than as happy and as healthy.",
      "And\nbelieve that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if I\ndeserved your love: and though I couldn t, and cannot help showing my\nnature to you, I regret it and repent it; and shall regret and repent\nit till I die!",
      "I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though\nwe should quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again.",
      "We were\nreconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not\nentirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted\nnature.",
      "He ll never let his friends be at ease, and he ll never be at\nease himself!",
      "I have always gone to his little parlour, since that\nnight; because his father returned the day after.",
      "About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were\nthe first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now\nwith his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I ve\nlearned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the\nlatter.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at\nall.",
      "Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him\nabusing poor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.",
      "I\ncan t tell how he knew of it, unless he listened.",
      "Linton had certainly\nbehaved provokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and\nI interrupted Mr. Heathcliff s lecture by entering and telling him so.",
      "He burst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that\nview of the matter.",
      "Since then, I ve told Linton he must whisper his\nbitter things.",
      "Now, Ellen, you have heard all.",
      "I can t be prevented\nfrom going to Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two\npeople; whereas, if you ll only not tell papa, my going need disturb\nthe tranquillity of none.",
      "You ll not tell, will you?",
      "It will be very\nheartless, if you do.",
      "I ll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,  I\nreplied.",
      "It requires some study; and so I ll leave you to your rest,\nand go think it over.",
      "I thought it over aloud, in my master s presence; walking straight from\nher room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of\nher conversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton.",
      "Mr.\nLinton was alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to\nme.",
      "In the morning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and\nshe learnt also that her secret visits were to end.",
      "In vain she wept\nand writhed against the interdict, and implored her father to have pity\non Linton: all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write\nand give him leave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but\nexplaining that he must no longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering\nHeights.",
      "Perhaps, had he been aware of his nephew s disposition and\nstate of health, he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight\nconsolation.",
      "CHAPTER XXV\n\n\n These things happened last winter, sir,  said Mrs. Dean;  hardly more\nthan a year ago.",
      "Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve\nmonths  end, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating\nthem!",
      "Yet, who knows how long you ll be a stranger?",
      "You re too young to\nrest always contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one\ncould see Catherine Linton and not love her.",
      "You smile; but why do you\nlook so lively and interested when I talk about her?",
      "and why have you\nasked me to hang her picture over your fireplace?",
      "and why ?",
      "Stop, my good friend!",
      "I cried.",
      "It may be very possible that _I_\nshould love her; but would she love me?",
      "I doubt it too much to venture\nmy tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not\nhere.",
      "I m of the busy world, and to its arms I must return.",
      "Go on.",
      "Was\nCatherine obedient to her father s commands?",
      "She was,  continued the housekeeper.",
      "Her affection for him was still\nthe chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke\nin the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils\nand foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he\ncould bequeath to guide her.",
      "He said to me, a few days afterwards,  I\nwish my nephew would write, Ellen, or call.",
      "Tell me, sincerely, what\nyou think of him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect\nof improvement, as he grows a man?",
      "He s very delicate, sir,  I replied;  and scarcely likely to reach\nmanhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if\nMiss Catherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond\nher control: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.",
      "However, master, you ll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him\nand see whether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his\nbeing of age.",
      "Edgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton\nKirk.",
      "It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and\nwe could just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the\nsparely-scattered gravestones.",
      "I ve prayed often,  he half soliloquised,  for the approach of what is\ncoming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it.",
      "I thought the memory of\nthe hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than\nthe anticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks,\nto be carried up, and laid in its lonely hollow!",
      "Ellen, I ve been very\nhappy with my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she\nwas a living hope at my side.",
      "But I ve been as happy musing by myself\namong those stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June\nevenings, on the green mound of her mother s grave, and\nwishing yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it.",
      "What can I\ndo for Cathy?",
      "How must I quit her?",
      "I d not care one moment for Linton\nbeing Heathcliff s son; nor for his taking her from me, if he could\nconsole her for my loss.",
      "I d not care that Heathcliff gained his ends,\nand triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing!",
      "But should Linton be\nunworthy only a feeble tool to his father I cannot abandon her to him!",
      "And, hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in\nmaking her sad while I live, and leaving her solitary when I die.",
      "Darling!",
      "I d rather resign her to God, and lay her in the earth before\nme.",
      "Resign her to God as it is, sir,  I answered,  and if we should lose\nyou which may He forbid under His providence, I ll stand her friend and\ncounsellor to the last.",
      "Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don t fear\nthat she will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are\nalways finally rewarded.",
      "Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he\nresumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.",
      "To her\ninexperienced notions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and\nthen his cheek was often flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt\nsure of his recovering.",
      "On her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit\nthe churchyard: it was raining, and I observed \n\n You ll surely not go out to-night, sir?",
      "He answered, No, I ll defer it this year a little longer.",
      "He wrote again to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and,\nhad the invalid been presentable, I ve no doubt his father would have\npermitted him to come.",
      "As it was, being instructed, he returned an\nanswer, intimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the\nGrange; but his uncle s kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to\nmeet him sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his\ncousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided.",
      "That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.",
      "Heathcliff\nknew he could plead eloquently for Catherine s company, then.",
      "I do not ask,  he said,  that she may visit here; but am I never to\nsee her, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid\nher to come to mine?",
      "Do, now and then, ride with her towards the\nHeights; and let us exchange a few words, in your presence!",
      "We have\ndone nothing to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me:\nyou have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.",
      "Dear uncle!",
      "send\nme a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,\nexcept at Thrushcross Grange.",
      "I believe an interview would convince you\nthat my father s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your\nnephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy\nof Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.",
      "You inquire after my health it is better; but while I remain cut off\nfrom all hope, and doomed to solitude, or the society of those who\nnever did and never will like me, how can I be cheerful and well?",
      "Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his\nrequest; because he could not accompany Catherine.",
      "He said, in summer,\nperhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing\nat intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was\nable by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.",
      "Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have\nspoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:\nbut his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on\nevery line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his\npeculiar personal sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly\nuppermost in his thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being\nheld asunder from his friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr.\nLinton must allow an interview soon, or he should fear he was purposely\ndeceiving him with empty promises.",
      "Cathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length\npersuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk\ntogether about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors\nnearest the Grange: for June found him still declining.",
      "Though he had\nset aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady s fortune,\nhe had a natural desire that she might retain or at least return in a\nshort time to the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only\nprospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea\nthat the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,\nI believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master\nHeathcliff to make report of his condition among us.",
      "I, for my part,\nbegan to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually\nrallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed\nso earnest in pursuing his object.",
      "I could not picture a father\ntreating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards\nlearned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:\nhis efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling\nplans were threatened with defeat by death.",
      "CHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSummer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his\nassent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first\nride to join her cousin.",
      "It was a close, sultry day: devoid of\nsunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our\nplace of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.",
      "On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a\nmessenger, told us that, Maister Linton wer just o  this side th \nHeights: and he d be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.",
      "Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,  I\nobserved:  he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at\nonce.",
      "Well, we ll turn our horses  heads round when we reach him,  answered\nmy companion;  our excursion shall lie towards home.",
      "But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from\nhis own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,\nand leave ours to graze.",
      "He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,\nand did not rise till we came within a few yards.",
      "Then he walked so\nfeebly, and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed, Why, Master\nHeathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.",
      "How ill\nyou do look!",
      "Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the\nejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation\non their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were\nworse than usual?",
      "No better better!",
      "he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if\nhe needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over\nher; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the\nlanguid expression they once possessed.",
      "But you have been worse,  persisted his cousin;  worse than when I saw\nyou last; you are thinner, and \n\n I m tired,  he interrupted, hurriedly.",
      "It is too hot for walking, let\nus rest here.",
      "And, in the morning, I often feel sick papa says I grow\nso fast.",
      "Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.",
      "This is something like your paradise,  said she, making an effort at\ncheerfulness.",
      "You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the\nplace and way each thought pleasantest?",
      "This is nearly yours, only\nthere are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer\nthan sunshine.",
      "Next week, if you can, we ll ride down to the Grange\nPark, and try mine.",
      "Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had\nevidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.",
      "His\nlack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity\nto contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\nconceal her disappointment.",
      "An indefinite alteration had come over his\nwhole person and manner.",
      "The pettishness that might be caressed into\nfondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the\npeevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be\nsoothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed\ninvalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured\nmirth of others as an insult.",
      "Catherine perceived, as well as I did,\nthat he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure\nour company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to\ndepart.",
      "That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,\nand threw him into a strange state of agitation.",
      "He glanced fearfully\ntowards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at\nleast.",
      "But I think,  said Cathy,  you d be more comfortable at home than\nsitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\nsongs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;\nyou have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse\nyou, I d willingly stay.",
      "Stay to rest yourself,  he replied.",
      "And, Catherine, don t think or\nsay that I m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make\nme dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.",
      "Tell\nuncle I m in tolerable health, will you?",
      "I ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.",
      "I couldn t affirm that you\nare,  observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion\nof what was evidently an untruth.",
      "And be here again next Thursday,  continued he, shunning her puzzled\ngaze.",
      "And give him my thanks for permitting you to come my best\nthanks, Catherine.",
      "And and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\nyou about me, don t lead him to suppose that I ve been extremely silent\nand stupid: don t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing he ll be\nangry.",
      "I care nothing for his anger,  exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\nits object.",
      "But I do,  said her cousin, shuddering.",
      "_Don t_ provoke him against\nme, Catherine, for he is very hard.",
      "Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?",
      "I inquired.",
      "Has he grown\nweary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?",
      "Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\nhis side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on\nhis breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of\nexhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for\nbilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did\nnot offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and\nannoy.",
      "Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?",
      "she whispered in my ear, at last.",
      "I\ncan t tell why we should stay.",
      "He s asleep, and papa will be wanting us\nback.",
      "Well, we must not leave him asleep,  I answered;  wait till he wakes,\nand be patient.",
      "You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\nsee poor Linton has soon evaporated!",
      "Why did _he_ wish to see me?",
      "returned Catherine.",
      "In his crossest\nhumours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\nmood.",
      "It s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform this\ninterview for fear his father should scold him.",
      "But I m hardly going to\ncome to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\nordering Linton to undergo this penance.",
      "And, though I m glad he s\nbetter in health, I m sorry he s so much less pleasant, and so much\nless affectionate to me.",
      "You think _he is_ better in health, then?",
      "I said.",
      "Yes,  she answered;  because he always made such a great deal of his\nsufferings, you know.",
      "He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\npapa; but he s better, very likely.",
      "There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,  I remarked;  I should\nconjecture him to be far worse.",
      "Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\nany one had called his name.",
      "No,  said Catherine;  unless in dreams.",
      "I cannot conceive how you\nmanage to doze out of doors, in the morning.",
      "I thought I heard my father,  he gasped, glancing up to the frowning\nnab above us.",
      "You are sure nobody spoke?",
      "Quite sure,  replied his cousin.",
      "Only Ellen and I were disputing\nconcerning your health.",
      "Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\nseparated in winter?",
      "If you be, I m certain one thing is not\nstronger your regard for me: speak, are you?",
      "The tears gushed from Linton s eyes as he answered,  Yes, yes, I am!",
      "And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\nand down to detect its owner.",
      "Cathy rose.",
      "For to-day we must part,  she said.",
      "And I won t conceal\nthat I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I ll\nmention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.\nHeathcliff.",
      "Hush,  murmured Linton;  for God s sake, hush!",
      "He s coming.",
      "And he\nclung to Catherine s arm, striving to detain her; but at that\nannouncement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\nobeyed her like a dog.",
      "I ll be here next Thursday,  she cried, springing to the saddle.",
      "Good-bye.",
      "Quick, Ellen!",
      "And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed\nwas he in anticipating his father s approach.",
      "Before we reached home, Catherine s displeasure softened into a\nperplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,\nuneasy doubts about Linton s actual circumstances, physical and social:\nin which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a\nsecond journey would make us better judges.",
      "My master requested an\naccount of our ongoings.",
      "His nephew s offering of thanks was duly\ndelivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little\nlight on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to\nreveal.",
      "CHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nSeven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\nrapid alteration of Edgar Linton s state.",
      "The havoc that months had\npreviously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.",
      "Catherine\nwe would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\ndelude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\nprobability, gradually ripening into certainty.",
      "She had not the heart\nto mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,\nand obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,\nwhere her father stopped a short time daily the brief period he could\nbear to sit up and his chamber, had become her whole world.",
      "She grudged\neach moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by\nhis side.",
      "Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my\nmaster gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a\nhappy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that\nshe would not now be left entirely alone after his death.",
      "He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,\nthat, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in\nmind; for Linton s letters bore few or no indications of his defective\ncharacter.",
      "And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from\ncorrecting the error; asking myself what good there would be in\ndisturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power\nnor opportunity to turn to account.",
      "We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\nAugust: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\nwhoever respired it, though dying, might revive.",
      "Catherine s face was\njust like the landscape shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\nsuccession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\ntransient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\npassing forgetfulness of its cares.",
      "We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.",
      "My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to\nstay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on\nhorseback; but I dissented: I wouldn t risk losing sight of the charge\ncommitted to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.",
      "Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:\nnot the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked\nmore like fear.",
      "It is late!",
      "he said, speaking short and with difficulty.",
      "Is not your\nfather very ill?",
      "I thought you wouldn t come.",
      "_Why_ won t you be candid?",
      "cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.",
      "Why cannot you say at once you don t want me?",
      "It is strange, Linton,\nthat for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,\napparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!",
      "Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;\nbut his cousin s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\nbehaviour.",
      "My father _is_ very ill,  she said;  and why am I called from his\nbedside?",
      "Why didn t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\nwished I wouldn t keep it?",
      "Come!",
      "I desire an explanation: playing and\ntrifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can t dance\nattendance on your affectations now!",
      "My affectations!",
      "he murmured;  what are they?",
      "For heaven s sake,\nCatherine, don t look so angry!",
      "Despise me as much as you please; I am\na worthless, cowardly wretch: I can t be scorned enough; but I m too\nmean for your anger.",
      "Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.",
      "Nonsense!",
      "cried Catherine in a passion.",
      "Foolish, silly boy!",
      "And\nthere!",
      "he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him!",
      "You needn t\nbespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\nservice.",
      "Get off!",
      "I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\nthe hearth-stone, and pretending what do we pretend?",
      "Let go my frock!",
      "If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\nspurn such pity.",
      "Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.",
      "Rise,\nand don t degrade yourself into an abject reptile _don t_!",
      "With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\nnerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\nterror.",
      "Oh!",
      "he sobbed,  I cannot bear it!",
      "Catherine, Catherine, I m a\ntraitor, too, and I dare not tell you!",
      "But leave me, and I shall be\nkilled!",
      "_Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said\nyou loved me, and if you did, it wouldn t harm you.",
      "You ll not go,\nthen?",
      "kind, sweet, good Catherine!",
      "And perhaps you _will_ consent and\nhe ll let me die with you!",
      "My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.",
      "The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\ngrew thoroughly moved and alarmed.",
      "Consent to what?",
      "she asked.",
      "To stay!",
      "tell me the meaning of this\nstrange talk, and I will.",
      "You contradict your own words, and distract\nme!",
      "Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\nheart.",
      "You wouldn t injure me, Linton, would you?",
      "You wouldn t let any\nenemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?",
      "I ll believe you are a coward,\nfor yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.",
      "But my father threatened me,  gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\nfingers,  and I dread him I dread him!",
      "I _dare_ not tell!",
      "Oh, well!",
      "said Catherine, with scornful compassion,  keep your\nsecret: _I m_ no coward.",
      "Save yourself: I m not afraid!",
      "Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\nsupporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.",
      "I was\ncogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\nnever suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\nhearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\nalmost close upon us, descending the Heights.",
      "He didn t cast a glance\ntowards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton s\nsobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\nto none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn t avoid doubting,\nhe said \n\n It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly.",
      "How are you at\nthe Grange?",
      "Let us hear.",
      "The rumour goes,  he added, in a lower tone,\n that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\nillness?",
      "No; my master is dying,  I replied:  it is true enough.",
      "A sad thing it\nwill be for us all, but a blessing for him!",
      "How long will he last, do you think?",
      "he asked.",
      "I don t know,  I said.",
      "Because,  he continued, looking at the two young people, who were\nfixed under his eye Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir\nor raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his\naccount because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I d\nthank his uncle to be quick, and go before him!",
      "Hallo!",
      "has the whelp\nbeen playing that game long?",
      "I _did_ give him some lessons about\nsnivelling.",
      "Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?",
      "Lively?",
      "no he has shown the greatest distress,  I answered.",
      "To see\nhim, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\nhills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.",
      "He shall be, in a day or two,  muttered Heathcliff.",
      "But first get up,\nLinton!",
      "Get up!",
      "he shouted.",
      "Don t grovel on the ground there: up,\nthis moment!",
      "Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\ncaused by his father s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\nelse to produce such humiliation.",
      "He made several efforts to obey, but\nhis little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back\nagain with a moan.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean\nagainst a ridge of turf.",
      "Now,  said he, with curbed ferocity,  I m getting angry and if you\ndon t command that paltry spirit of yours _damn_ you!",
      "get up directly!",
      "I will, father,  he panted.",
      "Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.",
      "I ve done as you wished, I m sure.",
      "Catherine will tell you that I that\nI have been cheerful.",
      "Ah!",
      "keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.",
      "Take mine,  said his father;  stand on your feet.",
      "There now she ll\nlend you her arm: that s right, look at _her_.",
      "You would imagine I was\nthe devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.",
      "Be so kind as to\nwalk home with him, will you?",
      "He shudders if I touch him.",
      "Linton dear!",
      "whispered Catherine,  I can t go to Wuthering Heights:\npapa has forbidden me.",
      "He ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?",
      "I can never re-enter that house,  he answered.",
      "I m _not_ to re-enter\nit without you!",
      "Stop!",
      "cried his father.",
      "We ll respect Catherine s filial scruples.",
      "Nelly, take him in, and I ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\nwithout delay.",
      "You ll do well,  replied I.",
      "But I must remain with my mistress: to\nmind your son is not my business.",
      "You are very stiff,  said Heathcliff,  I know that: but you ll force\nme to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.",
      "Come, then, my hero.",
      "Are you willing to return, escorted by me?",
      "He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile\nbeing; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored\nher to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no\ndenial.",
      "However I disapproved, I couldn t hinder her: indeed, how could\nshe have refused him herself?",
      "What was filling him with dread we had no\nmeans of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and\nany addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy.",
      "We reached the\nthreshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had\nconducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when\nMr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed My house is not stricken\nwith the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit\ndown, and allow me to shut the door.",
      "He shut and locked it also.",
      "I started.",
      "You shall have tea before you go home,  he added.",
      "I am by myself.",
      "Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\noff on a journey of pleasure; and, though I m used to being alone, I d\nrather have some interesting company, if I can get it.",
      "Miss Linton,\ntake your seat by _him_.",
      "I give you what I have: the present is hardly\nworth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer.",
      "It is Linton, I\nmean.",
      "How she does stare!",
      "It s odd what a savage feeling I have to\nanything that seems afraid of me!",
      "Had I been born where laws are less\nstrict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow\nvivisection of those two, as an evening s amusement.",
      "He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself,  By\nhell!",
      "I hate them.",
      "I am not afraid of you!",
      "exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\nlatter part of his speech.",
      "She stepped close up; her black eyes\nflashing with passion and resolution.",
      "Give me that key: I will have\nit!",
      "she said.",
      "I wouldn t eat or drink here, if I were starving.",
      "Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.",
      "He\nlooked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,\npossibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom\nshe inherited it.",
      "She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in\ngetting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to\nthe present; he recovered it speedily.",
      "Now, Catherine Linton,  he said,  stand off, or I shall knock you\ndown; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.",
      "Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its\ncontents again.",
      "We _will_ go!",
      "she repeated, exerting her utmost\nefforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails\nmade no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply.",
      "Heathcliff\nglanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.",
      "Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face.",
      "He opened\nthem suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had\nwell secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling\nher on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps\non both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his\nthreat, had she been able to fall.",
      "At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously.",
      "You villain!",
      "I\nbegan to cry,  you villain!",
      "A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\nstout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\nstaggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\nblood-vessel.",
      "The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\nput her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\nsure whether her ears were off or on.",
      "She trembled like a reed, poor\nthing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.",
      "I know how to chastise children, you see,  said the scoundrel, grimly,\nas he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\nfloor.",
      "Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!",
      "I shall\nbe your father, to-morrow all the father you ll have in a few days and\nyou shall have plenty of that.",
      "You can bear plenty; you re no weakling:\nyou shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in\nyour eyes again!",
      "Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\ncheek on my lap, weeping aloud.",
      "Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\nthe settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,\nthat the correction had alighted on another than him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff,\nperceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\nhimself.",
      "The cups and saucers were laid ready.",
      "He poured it out, and\nhanded me a cup.",
      "Wash away your spleen,  he said.",
      "And help your own naughty pet and\nmine.",
      "It is not poisoned, though I prepared it.",
      "I m going out to seek\nyour horses.",
      "Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.",
      "We\ntried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\nwindows they were too narrow for even Cathy s little figure.",
      "Master Linton,  I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned,  you\nknow what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or\nI ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin s. \n\n Yes, Linton, you must tell,  said Catherine.",
      "It was for your sake I\ncame; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.",
      "Give me some tea, I m thirsty, and then I ll tell you,  he answered.",
      "Mrs. Dean, go away.",
      "I don t like you standing over me.",
      "Now, Catherine,\nyou are letting your tears fall into my cup.",
      "I won t drink that.",
      "Give\nme another.",
      "Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face.",
      "I felt disgusted\nat the little wretch s composure, since he was no longer in terror for\nhimself.",
      "The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as\never he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced\nwith an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;\nand, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.",
      "Papa wants us to be married,  he continued, after sipping some of the\nliquid.",
      "And he knows your papa wouldn t let us marry now; and he s\nafraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\nand you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\nshall return home next day, and take me with you.",
      "Take you with her, pitiful changeling!",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "_You_ marry?",
      "Why, the man is mad!",
      "or he thinks us fools, every one.",
      "And do you\nimagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie\nherself to a little perishing monkey like you?",
      "Are you cherishing the\nnotion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you\nfor a husband?",
      "You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with\nyour dastardly puling tricks: and don t look so silly, now!",
      "I ve a very\ngood mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and\nyour imbecile conceit.",
      "I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he\ntook to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine\nrebuked me.",
      "Stay all night?",
      "No,  she said, looking slowly round.",
      "Ellen, I ll burn\nthat door down but I ll get out.",
      "And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\nLinton was up in alarm for his dear self again.",
      "He clasped her in his\ntwo feeble arms sobbing: Won t you have me, and save me?",
      "not let me\ncome to the Grange?",
      "Oh, darling Catherine!",
      "you mustn t go and leave,\nafter all.",
      "You _must_ obey my father you _must_!",
      "I must obey my own,  she replied,  and relieve him from this cruel\nsuspense.",
      "The whole night!",
      "What would he think?",
      "He ll be distressed\nalready.",
      "I ll either break or burn a way out of the house.",
      "Be quiet!",
      "You re in no danger; but if you hinder me Linton, I love papa better\nthan you!",
      "The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff s anger restored to the boy\nhis coward s eloquence.",
      "Catherine was near distraught: still, she\npersisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\npersuading him to subdue his selfish agony.",
      "While they were thus\noccupied, our jailor re-entered.",
      "Your beasts have trotted off,  he said,  and now Linton!",
      "snivelling\nagain?",
      "What has she been doing to you?",
      "Come, come have done, and get to\nbed.",
      "In a month or two, my lad, you ll be able to pay her back her\npresent tyrannies with a vigorous hand.",
      "You re pining for pure love,\nare you not?",
      "nothing else in the world: and she shall have you!",
      "There,\nto bed!",
      "Zillah won t be here to-night; you must undress yourself.",
      "Hush!",
      "hold your noise!",
      "Once in your own room, I ll not come near you: you\nneedn t fear.",
      "By chance, you ve managed tolerably.",
      "I ll look to the\nrest.",
      "He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and\nthe latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected\nthe person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.",
      "The lock\nwas re-secured.",
      "Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\nstood silent.",
      "Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\nher cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.",
      "Anybody else\nwould have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\nbut he scowled on her and muttered Oh!",
      "you are not afraid of me?",
      "Your\ncourage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!",
      "I _am_ afraid now,  she replied,  because, if I stay, papa will be\nmiserable: and how can I endure making him miserable when he when\nhe Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home!",
      "I promise to marry Linton: papa\nwould like me to: and I love him.",
      "Why should you wish to force me to do\nwhat I ll willingly do of myself?",
      "Let him dare to force you,  I cried.",
      "There s law in the land, thank\nGod!",
      "there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.",
      "I d inform if\nhe were my own son: and it s felony without benefit of clergy!",
      "Silence!",
      "said the ruffian.",
      "To the devil with your clamour!",
      "I don t\nwant _you_ to speak.",
      "Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\nthinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\nsatisfaction.",
      "You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\nresidence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing\nme that such an event would follow.",
      "As to your promise to marry Linton,\nI ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place\ntill it is fulfilled.",
      "Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I m safe!",
      "exclaimed Catherine,\nweeping bitterly.",
      "Or marry me now.",
      "Poor papa!",
      "Ellen, he ll think we re\nlost.",
      "What shall we do?",
      "Not he!",
      "He ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\nlittle amusement,  answered Heathcliff.",
      "You cannot deny that you\nentered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\nthe contrary.",
      "And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\nat your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that\nman _only_ your father.",
      "Catherine, his happiest days were over when\nyour days began.",
      "He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world\n(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went\nout of it.",
      "I d join him.",
      "I don t love you!",
      "How should I?",
      "Weep away.",
      "As\nfar as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless\nLinton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears\nto fancy he may.",
      "His letters of advice and consolation entertained me\nvastly.",
      "In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and\nkind to her when he got her.",
      "Careful and kind that s paternal.",
      "But\nLinton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.",
      "Linton can play the little tyrant well.",
      "He ll undertake to torture any\nnumber of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared.",
      "You ll\nbe able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get\nhome again, I assure you.",
      "You re right there!",
      "I said;  explain your son s character.",
      "Show his\nresemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\nbefore she takes the cockatrice!",
      "I don t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,  he answered;\n because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\nwith her, till your master dies.",
      "I can detain you both, quite\nconcealed, here.",
      "If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and\nyou ll have an opportunity of judging!",
      "I ll not retract my word,  said Catherine.",
      "I ll marry him within this\nhour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff,\nyou re a cruel man, but you re not a fiend; and you won t, from _mere_\nmalice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness.",
      "If papa thought I had\nleft him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to\nlive?",
      "I ve given over crying: but I m going to kneel here, at your\nknee; and I ll not get up, and I ll not take my eyes from your face\ntill you look back at me!",
      "No, don t turn away!",
      "_do_ look!",
      "you ll see\nnothing to provoke you.",
      "I don t hate you.",
      "I m not angry that you struck\nme.",
      "Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle?",
      "_never_?",
      "Ah!",
      "you must look once.",
      "I m so wretched, you can t help being sorry and\npitying me.",
      "Keep your eft s fingers off; and move, or I ll kick you!",
      "cried\nHeathcliff, brutally repulsing her.",
      "I d rather be hugged by a snake.",
      "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me?",
      "I _detest_ you!",
      "He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\nwith aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\nmouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse.",
      "But I was rendered\ndumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be\nshown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.",
      "It was\ngrowing dark we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.",
      "Our host\nhurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not.",
      "There\nwas a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.",
      "I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,  I observed to Catherine.",
      "I wish he would arrive!",
      "Who knows but he might take our part?",
      "It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,  said\nHeathcliff, overhearing me.",
      "You should have opened a lattice and\ncalled out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn t. She s glad\nto be obliged to stay, I m certain.",
      "At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\nwithout control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o clock.",
      "Then\nhe bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah s chamber; and I\nwhispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get\nthrough the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.",
      "The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap\nwas safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before.",
      "We\nneither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and\nwatched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I\ncould obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest.",
      "I\nseated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment\non my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the\nmisfortunes of my employers sprang.",
      "It was not the case, in reality, I\nam aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I\nthought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.",
      "At seven o clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.",
      "She\nran to the door immediately, and answered,  Yes.",
      "Here, then,  he\nsaid, opening it, and pulling her out.",
      "I rose to follow, but he turned\nthe lock again.",
      "I demanded my release.",
      "Be patient,  he replied;  I ll send up your breakfast in a while.",
      "I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine\nasked why I was still shut up?",
      "He answered, I must try to endure it\nanother hour, and they went away.",
      "I endured it two or three hours; at\nlength, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff s.\n\n I ve brought you something to eat,  said a voice;  oppen t  door!",
      "Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\nall day.",
      "Tak  it,  he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.",
      "Stay one minute,  I began.",
      "Nay,  cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\nforth to detain him.",
      "And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\nnight; and another, and another.",
      "Five nights and four days I remained,\naltogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\nmodel of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\nhis sense of justice or compassion.",
      "CHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nOn the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\napproached lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\nroom.",
      "It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\nbonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.",
      "Eh, dear!",
      "Mrs. Dean!",
      "she exclaimed.",
      "Well!",
      "there is a talk about you\nat Gimmerton.",
      "I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse\nmarsh, and missy with you, till master told me you d been found, and\nhe d lodged you here!",
      "What!",
      "and you must have got on an island, sure?",
      "And how long were you in the hole?",
      "Did master save you, Mrs. Dean?",
      "But\nyou re not so thin you ve not been so poorly, have you?",
      "Your master is a true scoundrel!",
      "I replied.",
      "But he shall answer for\nit.",
      "He needn t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!",
      "What do you mean?",
      "asked Zillah.",
      "It s not his tale: they tell that in\nthe village about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to\nEarnshaw, when I come in Eh, they s queer things, Mr. Hareton,\nhappened since I went off.",
      "It s a sad pity of that likely young lass,\nand cant Nelly Dean.",
      "He stared.",
      "I thought he had not heard aught, so I\ntold him the rumour.",
      "The master listened, and he just smiled to\nhimself, and said,  If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,\nZillah.",
      "Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room.",
      "You can\ntell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key.",
      "The bog-water got\ninto her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed\nher till she came round to her senses.",
      "You can bid her go to the Grange\nat once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young\nlady will follow in time to attend the squire s funeral.",
      "Mr. Edgar is not dead?",
      "I gasped.",
      "Oh!",
      "Zillah, Zillah!",
      "No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,  she replied;  you re right\nsickly yet.",
      "He s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\nday.",
      "I met him on the road and asked.",
      "Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\nbelow, for the way was free.",
      "On entering the house, I looked about for\nsome one to give information of Catherine.",
      "The place was filled with\nsunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.",
      "As I\nhesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\nslight cough drew my attention to the hearth.",
      "Linton lay on the settle,\nsole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\nwith apathetic eyes.",
      "Where is Miss Catherine?",
      "I demanded sternly,\nsupposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching\nhim thus, alone.",
      "He sucked on like an innocent.",
      "Is she gone?",
      "I said.",
      "No,  he replied;  she s upstairs: she s not to go; we won t let her.",
      "You won t let her, little idiot!",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "Direct me to her room\nimmediately, or I ll make you sing out sharply.",
      "Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,  he\nanswered.",
      "He says I m not to be soft with Catherine: she s my wife,\nand it s shameful that she should wish to leave me.",
      "He says she hates\nme and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan t have\nit: and she shan t go home!",
      "She never shall!",
      "she may cry, and be sick\nas much as she pleases!",
      "He resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to\ndrop asleep.",
      "Master Heathcliff,  I resumed,  have you forgotten all Catherine s\nkindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\nshe brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\nwind and snow to see you?",
      "She wept to miss one evening, because you\nwould be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times\ntoo good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though\nyou know he detests you both.",
      "And you join him against her.",
      "That s fine\ngratitude, is it not?",
      "The corner of Linton s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\nlips.",
      "Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?",
      "I continued.",
      "Think for yourself!",
      "As to your money, she does not even know that you\nwill have any.",
      "And you say she s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\nthere in a strange house!",
      "_You_ who have felt what it is to be so\nneglected!",
      "You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,\ntoo; but you won t pity hers!",
      "I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you\nsee an elderly woman, and a servant merely and you, after pretending\nsuch affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every\ntear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease.",
      "Ah!",
      "you re a\nheartless, selfish boy!",
      "I can t stay with her,  he answered crossly.",
      "I ll not stay by myself.",
      "She cries so I can t bear it.",
      "And she won t give over, though I say\nI ll call my father.",
      "I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle\nher if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the\nroom, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for\nvexation that I couldn t sleep.",
      "Is Mr. Heathcliff out?",
      "I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\ncreature had no power to sympathise with his cousin s mental tortures.",
      "He s in the court,  he replied,  talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\nuncle is dying, truly, at last.",
      "I m glad, for I shall be master of the\nGrange after him.",
      "Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house.",
      "It isn t\nhers!",
      "It s mine: papa says everything she has is mine.",
      "All her nice\nbooks are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\nher pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;\nbut I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine.",
      "And\nthen she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I\nshould have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,\nand on the other uncle, when they were young.",
      "That was yesterday I said\n_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her.",
      "The spiteful\nthing wouldn t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.",
      "I shrieked\nout that frightens her she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges\nand divided the case, and gave me her mother s portrait; the other she\nattempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\nit.",
      "He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\nshe refused, and he he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\nand crushed it with his foot.",
      "And were you pleased to see her struck?",
      "I asked: having my designs in\nencouraging his talk.",
      "I winked,  he answered:  I wink to see my father strike a dog or a\nhorse, he does it so hard.",
      "Yet I was glad at first she deserved\npunishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to\nthe window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her\nteeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the\nbits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,\nand she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can t\nspeak for pain.",
      "I don t like to think so; but she s a naughty thing for\ncrying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I m afraid of her.",
      "And you can get the key if you choose?",
      "I said.",
      "Yes, when I am upstairs,  he answered;  but I can t walk upstairs\nnow.",
      "In what apartment is it?",
      "I asked.",
      "Oh,  he cried,  I shan t tell _you_ where it is.",
      "It is our secret.",
      "Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.",
      "There!",
      "you ve tired\nme go away, go away!",
      "And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\nhis eyes again.",
      "I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring\na rescue for my young lady from the Grange.",
      "On reaching it, the\nastonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\nintense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two\nor three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar s door:\nbut I bespoke the announcement of it myself.",
      "How changed I found him,\neven in those few days!",
      "He lay an image of sadness and resignation\nawaiting his death.",
      "Very young he looked: though his actual age was\nthirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least.",
      "He\nthought of Catherine; for he murmured her name.",
      "I touched his hand, and\nspoke.",
      "Catherine is coming, dear master!",
      "I whispered;  she is alive and\nwell; and will be here, I hope, to-night.",
      "I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\nlooked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.",
      "As\nsoon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\nthe Heights.",
      "I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\ntrue.",
      "I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I\ndescribe all his father s brutal conduct my intentions being to add no\nbitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.",
      "He divined that one of his enemy s purposes was to secure the personal\nproperty, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\nhe did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\nignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.",
      "However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of\nleaving Catherine s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put\nit in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her\nchildren, if she had any, after her.",
      "By that means, it could not fall\nto Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.",
      "Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,\nand four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young\nlady of her jailor.",
      "Both parties were delayed very late.",
      "The single\nservant returned first.",
      "He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he\narrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;\nand then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village\nthat must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before\nmorning.",
      "The four men came back unaccompanied also.",
      "They brought word\nthat Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would\nnot suffer them to see her.",
      "I scolded the stupid fellows well for\nlistening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving\nto take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it\nliterally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us.",
      "Her\nfather _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be\nkilled on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!",
      "Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.",
      "I had gone\ndownstairs at three o clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\nthrough the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front\ndoor made me jump.",
      "Oh!",
      "it is Green,  I said, recollecting myself only\nGreen,  and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\nthe knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.",
      "I put the\njug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.",
      "The harvest moon\nshone clear outside.",
      "It was not the attorney.",
      "My own sweet little\nmistress sprang on my neck sobbing,  Ellen, Ellen!",
      "Is papa alive?",
      "Yes,  I cried:  yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe\nwith us again!",
      "She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton s\nroom; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,\nand washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.",
      "Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to\nsay, she should be happy with young Heathcliff.",
      "She stared, but soon\ncomprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured\nme she would not complain.",
      "I couldn t abide to be present at their meeting.",
      "I stood outside the\nchamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\nthen.",
      "All was composed, however: Catherine s despair was as silent as\nher father s joy.",
      "She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\non her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.",
      "He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.",
      "Kissing her cheek, he\nmurmured, I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to\nus!",
      "and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant\ngaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.",
      "None\ncould have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely\nwithout a struggle.",
      "Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\nweighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\nsat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that\ndeathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.",
      "It\nwas well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the\nlawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how\nto behave.",
      "He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of\nhis delay in obeying my master s summons.",
      "Fortunately, no thought of\nworldly affairs crossed the latter s mind, to disturb him, after his\ndaughter s arrival.",
      "Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\nplace.",
      "He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.",
      "He would have\ncarried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\nLinton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with\nhis family.",
      "There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\nprotestations against any infringement of its directions.",
      "The funeral\nwas hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered\nto stay at the Grange till her father s corpse had quitted it.",
      "She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the\nrisk of liberating her.",
      "She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,\nand she gathered the sense of Heathcliff s answer.",
      "It drove her\ndesperate.",
      "Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon\nafter I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father\nre-ascended.",
      "He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without\nshutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep\nwith Hareton, and his petition was granted for once.",
      "Catherine stole\nout before break of day.",
      "She dared not try the doors lest the dogs\nshould raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined\ntheir windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother s, she got easily\nout of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree\nclose by.",
      "Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,\nnotwithstanding his timid contrivances.",
      "CHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\nlibrary; now musing mournfully one of us despairingly on our loss, now\nventuring conjectures as to the gloomy future.",
      "We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would\nbe a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during\nLinton s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as\nhousekeeper.",
      "That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be\nhoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect\nof retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved\nyoung mistress; when a servant one of the discarded ones, not yet\ndeparted rushed hastily in, and said  that devil Heathcliff  was coming\nthrough the court: should he fasten the door in his face?",
      "If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.",
      "He\nmade no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\navailed himself of the master s privilege to walk straight in, without\nsaying a word.",
      "The sound of our informant s voice directed him to the\nlibrary; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.",
      "It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,\neighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the\nsame autumn landscape lay outside.",
      "We had not yet lighted a candle, but\nall the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the\nsplendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.",
      "Heathcliff advanced to the hearth.",
      "Time had little altered his person\neither.",
      "There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more\ncomposed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other\ndifference.",
      "Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she\nsaw him.",
      "Stop!",
      "he said, arresting her by the arm.",
      "No more runnings away!",
      "Where would you go?",
      "I m come to fetch you home; and I hope you ll be a\ndutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.",
      "I\nwas embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the\nbusiness: he s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you ll\nsee by his look that he has received his due!",
      "I brought him down one\nevening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and\nnever touched him afterwards.",
      "I sent Hareton out, and we had the room\nto ourselves.",
      "In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and\nsince then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I\nfancy he sees me often, though I am not near.",
      "Hareton says he wakes and\nshrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him\nfrom me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must\ncome: he s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.",
      "Why not let Catherine continue here,  I pleaded,  and send Master\nLinton to her?",
      "As you hate them both, you d not miss them: they _can_\nonly be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.",
      "I m seeking a tenant for the Grange,  he answered;  and I want my\nchildren about me, to be sure.",
      "Besides, that lass owes me her services\nfor her bread.",
      "I m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness\nafter Linton is gone.",
      "Make haste and get ready, now; and don t oblige\nme to compel you.",
      "I shall,  said Catherine.",
      "Linton is all I have to love in the world,\nand though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and\nme to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other.",
      "And I defy you to hurt\nhim when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!",
      "You are a boastful champion,  replied Heathcliff;  but I don t like\nyou well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the\ntorment, as long as it lasts.",
      "It is not I who will make him hateful to\nyou it is his own sweet spirit.",
      "He s as bitter as gall at your\ndesertion and its consequences: don t expect thanks for this noble\ndevotion.",
      "I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he\nwould do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his\nvery weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.",
      "I know he has a bad nature,  said Catherine:  he s your son.",
      "But I m\nglad I ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\nreason I love him.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;\nand, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\nthinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.",
      "You _are_\nmiserable, are you not?",
      "Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?",
      "_Nobody_ loves you _nobody_ will cry for you when you die!",
      "I wouldn t\nbe you!",
      "Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made\nup her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw\npleasure from the griefs of her enemies.",
      "You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,  said her father-in-law,\n if you stand there another minute.",
      "Begone, witch, and get your\nthings!",
      "She scornfully withdrew.",
      "In her absence I began to beg for Zillah s\nplace at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would\nsuffer it on no account.",
      "He bid me be silent; and then, for the first\ntime, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the\npictures.",
      "Having studied Mrs. Linton s, he said I shall have that\nhome.",
      "Not because I need it, but  He turned abruptly to the fire, and\ncontinued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a\nsmile I ll tell you what I did yesterday!",
      "I got the sexton, who was\ndigging Linton s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I\nopened it.",
      "I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her\nface again it is hers yet!",
      "he had hard work to stir me; but he said it\nwould change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the\ncoffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton s side, damn him!",
      "I wish\nhe d been soldered in lead.",
      "And I bribed the sexton to pull it away\nwhen I m laid there, and slide mine out too; I ll have it made so: and\nthen by the time Linton gets to us he ll not know which is which!",
      "You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "I exclaimed;  were you not\nashamed to disturb the dead?",
      "I disturbed nobody, Nelly,  he replied;  and I gave some ease to\nmyself.",
      "I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you ll have a\nbetter chance of keeping me underground, when I get there.",
      "Disturbed\nher?",
      "No!",
      "she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\nyears incessantly remorselessly till yesternight; and yesternight I was\ntranquil.",
      "I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with\nmy heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.",
      "And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you\nhave dreamt of then?",
      "I said.",
      "Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!",
      "he answered.",
      "Do\nyou suppose I dread any change of that sort?",
      "I expected such a\ntransformation on raising the lid, but I m better pleased that it should\nnot commence till I share it.",
      "Besides, unless I had received a distinct\nimpression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would\nhardly have been removed.",
      "It began oddly.",
      "You know I was wild after she\ndied; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her\nspirit!",
      "I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they\ncan, and do, exist among us!",
      "The day she was buried, there came a fall\nof snow.",
      "In the evening I went to the churchyard.",
      "It blew bleak as\nwinter all round was solitary.",
      "I didn t fear that her fool of a husband\nwould wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring\nthem there.",
      "Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the\nsole barrier between us, I said to myself I ll have her in my arms\nagain!",
      "If she be cold, I ll think it is this north wind that chills\n_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.",
      "I got a spade from the\ntool-house, and began to delve with all my might it scraped the coffin;\nI fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the\nscrews; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that\nI heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and\nbending down.",
      "If I can only get this off,  I muttered,  I wish they\nmay shovel in the earth over us both!",
      "and I wrenched at it more\ndesperately still.",
      "There was another sigh, close at my ear.",
      "I appeared\nto feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind.",
      "I knew\nno living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you\nperceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it\ncannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not\nunder me, but on the earth.",
      "A sudden sense of relief flowed from my\nheart through every limb.",
      "I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned\nconsoled at once: unspeakably consoled.",
      "Her presence was with me: it\nremained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home.",
      "You may laugh,\nif you will; but I was sure I should see her there.",
      "I was sure she was\nwith me, and I could not help talking to her.",
      "Having reached the\nHeights, I rushed eagerly to the door.",
      "It was fastened; and, I\nremember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance.",
      "I\nremember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying\nupstairs, to my room and hers.",
      "I looked round impatiently I felt her by\nme I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!",
      "I ought to have\nsweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning from the fervour of\nmy supplications to have but one glimpse!",
      "I had not one.",
      "She showed\nherself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!",
      "And, since then,\nsometimes more and sometimes less, I ve been the sport of that\nintolerable torture!",
      "Infernal!",
      "keeping my nerves at such a stretch\nthat, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have\nrelaxed to the feebleness of Linton s. When I sat in the house with\nHareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked\non the moors I should meet her coming in.",
      "When I went from home I\nhastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was\ncertain!",
      "And when I slept in her chamber I was beaten out of that.",
      "I\ncouldn t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\noutside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,\nor even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a\nchild; and I must open my lids to see.",
      "And so I opened and closed them\na hundred times a night to be always disappointed!",
      "It racked me!",
      "I ve\noften groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that\nmy conscience was playing the fiend inside of me.",
      "Now, since I ve seen\nher, I m pacified a little.",
      "It was a strange way of killing: not by\ninches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the\nspectre of a hope through eighteen years!",
      "Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\nwith perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,\nthe brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the\ngrim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of\ntrouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one\nabsorbing subject.",
      "He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.",
      "I didn t like to hear him talk!",
      "After a short period he resumed his\nmeditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa\nto contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine\nentered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be\nsaddled.",
      "Send that over to-morrow,  said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\nhe added:  You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and\nyou ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,\nyour own feet will serve you.",
      "Come along.",
      "Good-bye, Ellen!",
      "whispered my dear little mistress.",
      "As she kissed me,\nher lips felt like ice.",
      "Come and see me, Ellen; don t forget.",
      "Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!",
      "said her new father.",
      "When\nI wish to speak to you I ll come here.",
      "I want none of your prying at my\nhouse!",
      "He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my\nheart, she obeyed.",
      "I watched them, from the window, walk down the\ngarden.",
      "Heathcliff fixed Catherine s arm under his: though she disputed\nthe act at first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into\nthe alley, whose trees concealed them.",
      "CHAPTER XXX\n\n\nI have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\nleft: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\nand wouldn t let me pass.",
      "He said Mrs. Linton was  thrang,  and the\nmaster was not in.",
      "Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\notherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.",
      "She thinks\nCatherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.",
      "My\nyoung lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.\nHeathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his\ndaughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,\nbeing a narrow-minded, selfish woman.",
      "Catherine evinced a child s\nannoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted\nmy informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some\ngreat wrong.",
      "I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a\nlittle before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and\nthis is what she told me.",
      "The first thing Mrs. Linton did,  she said,  on her arrival at the\nHeights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\nand Joseph; she shut herself into Linton s room, and remained till\nmorning.",
      "Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\nentered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be\nsent for?",
      "her cousin was very ill.\n\n We know that!",
      "answered Heathcliff;  but his life is not worth a\nfarthing, and I won t spend a farthing on him.",
      "But I cannot tell how to do,  she said;  and if nobody will help me,\nhe ll die!",
      "Walk out of the room,  cried the master,  and let me never hear a\nword more about him!",
      "None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act\nthe nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.",
      "Then she began to bother me, and I said I d had enough plague with the\ntiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\nMr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.",
      "How they managed together, I can t tell.",
      "I fancy he fretted a great\ndeal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little\nrest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.",
      "She sometimes\ncame into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would\nfain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never\ndare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that\nKenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to\nadvise or complain, and I always refused to meddle.",
      "Once or twice,\nafter we had gone to bed, I ve happened to open my door again and seen\nher sitting crying on the stairs -top; and then I ve shut myself in\nquick, for fear of being moved to interfere.",
      "I did pity her then, I m\nsure: still I didn t wish to lose my place, you know.",
      "At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\nout of my wits, by saying,  Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is\ndying I m sure he is, this time.",
      "Get up, instantly, and tell him.",
      "Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.",
      "I lay a quarter of an\nhour listening and trembling.",
      "Nothing stirred the house was quiet.",
      "She s mistaken, I said to myself.",
      "He s got over it.",
      "I needn t disturb\nthem; and I began to doze.",
      "But my sleep was marred a second time by a\nsharp ringing of the bell the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\nLinton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and\ninform them that he wouldn t have that noise repeated.",
      "I delivered Catherine s message.",
      "He cursed to himself, and in a few\nminutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room.",
      "I\nfollowed.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\nfolded on her knees.",
      "Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\nLinton s face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to\nher.",
      "Now Catherine,  he said,  how do you feel?",
      "She was dumb.",
      "How do you feel, Catherine?",
      "he repeated.",
      "He s safe, and I m free,  she answered:  I should feel well but,  she\ncontinued, with a bitterness she couldn t conceal,  you have left me so\nlong to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death!",
      "I\nfeel like death!",
      "And she looked like it, too!",
      "I gave her a little wine.",
      "Hareton and\nJoseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and\nheard our talk from outside, now entered.",
      "Joseph was fain, I believe,\nof the lad s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was\nmore taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.",
      "But\nthe master bid him get off to bed again: we didn t want his help.",
      "He\nafterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\nreturn to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.",
      "In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to\nbreakfast: she had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she\nwas ill; at which I hardly wondered.",
      "I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he\nreplied, Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and\nthen to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell\nme.",
      "Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\ntwice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\nat increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.",
      "Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton s will.",
      "He had bequeathed\nthe whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\nfather: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act\nduring her week s absence, when his uncle died.",
      "The lands, being a\nminor, he could not meddle with.",
      "However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed\nand kept them in his wife s right and his also: I suppose legally; at\nany rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his\npossession.",
      "Nobody,  said Zillah,  ever approached her door, except that once, but\nI; and nobody asked anything about her.",
      "The first occasion of her\ncoming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.",
      "She had cried\nout, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn t bear any longer\nbeing in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross\nGrange, and Earnshaw and I needn t hinder her from descending; so, as\nsoon as she heard Heathcliff s horse trot off, she made her appearance,\ndonned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as\nplain as a Quaker: she couldn t comb them out.",
      "Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:  the kirk, (you know,\nhas no minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists \nor Baptists  place, I can t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)",
      "Joseph had gone,  she continued,  but I thought proper to bide at\nhome.",
      "Young folks are always the better for an elder s over-looking;\nand Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn t a model of nice behaviour.",
      "I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she\nhad been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good\nleave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.",
      "He\ncoloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.",
      "The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.",
      "I saw\nhe meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted\nto be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master\nis by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.",
      "He grew sullen, and began to swear.",
      "Now, Mrs. Dean,  Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\nyou re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\nlower.",
      "And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\nnow?",
      "She s as poor as you or I: poorer, I ll be bound: you re saving,\nand I m doing my little all that road.",
      "Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into\na good humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former\ninsults, he tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper s\naccount.",
      "Missis walked in,  she said,  as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\nprincess.",
      "I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.",
      "No, she\nturned up her nose at my civility.",
      "Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\nto the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.",
      "I ve been starved a month and more,  she answered, resting on the\nword as scornful as she could.",
      "And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\nof us.",
      "Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\ndiscovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\nfeet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.",
      "Her\ncousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\nto help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\ncame to hand.",
      "That was a great advance for the lad.",
      "She didn t thank him; still, he\nfelt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\nstand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\nstruck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was\nhe daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his\nfinger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking\nat her instead of the book.",
      "She continued reading, or seeking for\nsomething to read.",
      "His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in\nthe study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn t see, and she\ncouldn t see him.",
      "And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but\nattracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring\nto touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if\nit were a bird.",
      "He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started\nround in such a taking.",
      "Get away this moment!",
      "How dare you touch me?",
      "Why are you stopping\nthere?",
      "she cried, in a tone of disgust.",
      "I can t endure you!",
      "I ll go\nupstairs again, if you come near me.",
      "Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down\nin the settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes\nanother half hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.",
      "Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?",
      "I m stalled of doing naught;\nand I do like I could like to hear her!",
      "Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask\nof yourseln.",
      "Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma am,  I said, immediately.",
      "He d take it very kind he d be much obliged.",
      "She frowned; and looking up, answered \n\n Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to\nunderstand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the\nhypocrisy to offer!",
      "I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any\nof you!",
      "When I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see\none of your faces, you all kept off.",
      "But I won t complain to you!",
      "I m\ndriven down here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your\nsociety.",
      "What could I ha  done?",
      "began Earnshaw.",
      "How was I to blame?",
      "Oh!",
      "you are an exception,  answered Mrs. Heathcliff.",
      "I never missed\nsuch a concern as you.",
      "But I offered more than once, and asked,  he said, kindling up at her\npertness,  I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you \n\n Be silent!",
      "I ll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your\ndisagreeable voice in my ear!",
      "said my lady.",
      "Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him!",
      "and unslinging his\ngun, restrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.",
      "He\ntalked now, freely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her\nsolitude: but the frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was\nforced to condescend to our company, more and more.",
      "However, I took\ncare there should be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since,\nI ve been as stiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us:\nand she does not deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her,\nand she ll curl back without respect of any one.",
      "She ll snap at the\nmaster himself, and as good as dares him to thrash her; and the more\nhurt she gets, the more venomous she grows.",
      "At first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my\nsituation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:\nbut Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton\nin an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless\nshe could marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my\nprovince to arrange.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nThus ended Mrs. Dean s story.",
      "Notwithstanding the doctor s prophecy, I\nam rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week\nin January, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and\nriding over to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall\nspend the next six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out\nfor another tenant to take the place after October.",
      "I would not pass\nanother winter here for much.",
      "CHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nYesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.",
      "I went to the Heights as I\nproposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to\nher young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not\nconscious of anything odd in her request.",
      "The front door stood open,\nbut the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and\ninvoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I\nentered.",
      "The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.",
      "I took\nparticular notice of him this time; but then he does his best\napparently to make the least of his advantages.",
      "I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?",
      "He answered, No; but he would\nbe in at dinner-time.",
      "It was eleven o clock, and I announced my\nintention of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately\nflung down his tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not\nas a substitute for the host.",
      "We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in\npreparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more\nsulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first.",
      "She hardly\nraised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the\nsame disregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning\nmy bow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.",
      "She does not seem so amiable,  I thought,  as Mrs. Dean would persuade\nme to believe.",
      "She s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.",
      "Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.",
      "Remove them\nyourself,  she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\nretiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\nbirds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.",
      "I approached\nher, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,\nadroitly dropped Mrs. Dean s note on to her knee, unnoticed by\nHareton but she asked aloud,  What is that?",
      "And chucked it off.",
      "A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,  I\nanswered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\nshould be imagined a missive of my own.",
      "She would gladly have gathered\nit up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it\nin his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.",
      "Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very\nstealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her\neyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer\nfeelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,\nas ungraciously as he could.",
      "Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;\nthen she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and\nirrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured\nin soliloquy:\n\n I should like to be riding Minny down there!",
      "I should like to be\nclimbing up there!",
      "Oh!",
      "I m tired I m _stalled_, Hareton!",
      "And she leant\nher pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\nsigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring\nnor knowing whether we remarked her.",
      "Mrs. Heathcliff,  I said, after sitting some time mute,  you are not\naware that I am an acquaintance of yours?",
      "so intimate that I think it\nstrange you won t come and speak to me.",
      "My housekeeper never wearies of\ntalking about and praising you; and she ll be greatly disappointed if I\nreturn with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\nand said nothing!",
      "She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked, \n\n Does Ellen like you?",
      "Yes, very well,  I replied, hesitatingly.",
      "You must tell her,  she continued,  that I would answer her letter,\nbut I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might\ntear a leaf.",
      "No books!",
      "I exclaimed.",
      "How do you contrive to live here without\nthem?",
      "if I may take the liberty to inquire.",
      "Though provided with a\nlarge library, I m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books\naway, and I should be desperate!",
      "I was always reading, when I had them,  said Catherine;  and Mr.\nHeathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my\nbooks.",
      "I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.",
      "Only once, I searched\nthrough Joseph s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,\nHareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room some Latin and Greek,\nand some tales and poetry: all old friends.",
      "I brought the last here and\nyou gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love\nof stealing!",
      "They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in\nthe bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.",
      "Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my\ntreasures?",
      "But I ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my\nheart, and you cannot deprive me of those!",
      "Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\nprivate literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of\nher accusations.",
      "Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,  I\nsaid, coming to his rescue.",
      "He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\nattainments.",
      "He ll be a clever scholar in a few years.",
      "And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,  answered Catherine.",
      "Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty\nblunders he makes!",
      "I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did\nyesterday: it was extremely funny.",
      "I heard you; and I heard you turning\nover the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing\nbecause you couldn t read their explanations!",
      "The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\nfor his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.",
      "I had a\nsimilar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean s anecdote of his first\nattempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\nobserved, But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\neach stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\ninstead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.",
      "Oh!",
      "she replied,  I don t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he\nhas no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me\nwith his vile mistakes and mispronunciations!",
      "Those books, both prose\nand verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to\nhave them debased and profaned in his mouth!",
      "Besides, of all, he has\nselected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out\nof deliberate malice.",
      "Hareton s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\nsense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to\nsuppress.",
      "I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his\nembarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the\nexternal prospect as I stood.",
      "He followed my example, and left the\nroom; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his\nhands, which he threw into Catherine s lap, exclaiming, Take them!",
      "I\nnever want to hear, or read, or think of them again!",
      "I won t have them now,  she answered.",
      "I shall connect them with you,\nand hate them.",
      "She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\nportion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\nfrom her.",
      "And listen,  she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\nof an old ballad in the same fashion.",
      "But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\naltogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.",
      "The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin s sensitive\nthough uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode\nhe had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the\ninflictor.",
      "He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the\nfire.",
      "I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that\nsacrifice to spleen.",
      "I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the\npleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing\npleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the\nincitement to his secret studies also.",
      "He had been content with daily\nlabour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.",
      "Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters\nto higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning\nhim to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the\ncontrary result.",
      "Yes, that s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!",
      "cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the\nconflagration with indignant eyes.",
      "You d _better_ hold your tongue, now,  he answered fiercely.",
      "And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\nentrance, where I made way for him to pass.",
      "But ere he had crossed the\ndoor-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,\nand laying hold of his shoulder asked, What s to do now, my lad?",
      "Naught, naught,  he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger\nin solitude.",
      "Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.",
      "It will be odd if I thwart myself,  he muttered, unconscious that I\nwas behind him.",
      "But when I look for his father in his face, I find\n_her_ every day more!",
      "How the devil is he so like?",
      "I can hardly bear to\nsee him.",
      "He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.",
      "There was a\nrestless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked\nthere before; and he looked sparer in person.",
      "His daughter-in-law, on\nperceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,\nso that I remained alone.",
      "I m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,  he said, in\nreply to my greeting;  from selfish motives partly: I don t think I\ncould readily supply your loss in this desolation.",
      "I ve wondered more\nthan once what brought you here.",
      "An idle whim, I fear, sir,  was my answer;  or else an idle whim is\ngoing to spirit me away.",
      "I shall set out for London next week; and I\nmust give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\nGrange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.",
      "I believe I shall\nnot live there any more.",
      "Oh, indeed; you re tired of being banished from the world, are you?",
      "he said.",
      "But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you\nwon t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my\ndue from any one.",
      "I m coming to plead off nothing about it,  I exclaimed, considerably\nirritated.",
      "Should you wish it, I ll settle with you now,  and I drew\nmy note-book from my pocket.",
      "No, no,  he replied, coolly;  you ll leave sufficient behind to cover\nyour debts, if you fail to return: I m not in such a hurry.",
      "Sit down\nand take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his\nvisit can generally be made welcome.",
      "Catherine!",
      "bring the things in:\nwhere are you?",
      "Catherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.",
      "You may get your dinner with Joseph,  muttered Heathcliff, aside,  and\nremain in the kitchen till he is gone.",
      "She obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no\ntemptation to transgress.",
      "Living among clowns and misanthropists, she\nprobably cannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets\nthem.",
      "With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\nabsolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and\nbade adieu early.",
      "I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\nglimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders\nto lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I\ncould not fulfil my wish.",
      "How dreary life gets over in that house!",
      "I reflected, while riding\ndown the road.",
      "What a realisation of something more romantic than a\nfairy tale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I\nstruck up an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated\ntogether into the stirring atmosphere of the town!",
      "CHAPTER XXXII\n\n\n1802.",
      "This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend\nin the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came\nwithin fifteen miles of Gimmerton.",
      "The ostler at a roadside\npublic-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a\ncart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he\nremarked, Yon s frough Gimmerton, nah!",
      "They re allas three wick  after\nother folk wi  ther harvest.",
      "Gimmerton?",
      "I repeated my residence in that locality had already grown\ndim and dreamy.",
      "Ah!",
      "I know.",
      "How far is it from this?",
      "Happen fourteen mile o er th  hills; and a rough road,  he answered.",
      "A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.",
      "It was scarcely\nnoon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\nroof as in an inn.",
      "Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\nmatters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\nthe neighbourhood again.",
      "Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\ninquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,\nwe managed the distance in some three hours.",
      "I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.",
      "The grey church\nlooked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.",
      "I distinguished a\nmoor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.",
      "It was sweet, warm\nweather too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\nenjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\nAugust, I m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\nsolitudes.",
      "In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more\ndivine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells\nof heath.",
      "I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\nfamily had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,\nblue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.",
      "I\nrode into the court.",
      "Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat\nknitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a\nmeditative pipe.",
      "Is Mrs. Dean within?",
      "I demanded of the dame.",
      "Mistress Dean?",
      "Nay!",
      "she answered,  she doesn t bide here: shoo s up\nat th  Heights.",
      "Are you the housekeeper, then?",
      "I continued.",
      "Eea, Aw keep th  hause,  she replied.",
      "Well, I m Mr. Lockwood, the master.",
      "Are there any rooms to lodge me\nin, I wonder?",
      "I wish to stay all night.",
      "T  maister!",
      "she cried in astonishment.",
      "Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\ncoming?",
      "Yah sud ha  send word.",
      "They s nowt norther dry nor mensful\nabaht t  place: nowt there isn t!",
      "She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I\nentered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,\nthat I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her\nbe composed.",
      "I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to\nprepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to\nsleep in.",
      "No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were\nnecessary.",
      "She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the\nhearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and\nmalappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,\nconfiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.",
      "Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion.",
      "An\nafter-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.",
      "All well at the Heights?",
      "I inquired of the woman.",
      "Eea, f r owt ee knaw!",
      "she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\ncinders.",
      "I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\nimpossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\nexit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\nand the mild glory of a rising moon in front one fading, and the other\nbrightening as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\nbranching off to Mr. Heathcliff s dwelling.",
      "Before I arrived in sight\nof it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the\nwest: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of\ngrass, by that splendid moon.",
      "I had neither to climb the gate nor to\nknock it yielded to my hand.",
      "That is an improvement, I thought.",
      "And I\nnoticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and\nwallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.",
      "Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\ncoal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\nthe eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.",
      "But the house\nof Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\nfor withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates\nthere were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.",
      "I\ncould both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\nlistened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\ncuriosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.",
      "Con-_trary_!",
      "said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.",
      "That for the\nthird time, you dunce!",
      "I m not going to tell you again.",
      "Recollect, or\nI ll pull your hair!",
      "Contrary, then,  answered another, in deep but softened tones.",
      "And\nnow, kiss me, for minding so well.",
      "No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.",
      "The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\nand seated at a table, having a book before him.",
      "His handsome features\nglowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\npage to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\nsmart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\ninattention.",
      "Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\nblending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to\nsuperintend his studies; and her face it was lucky he could not see her\nface, or he would never have been so steady.",
      "I could; and I bit my lip\nin spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing\nsomething besides staring at its smiting beauty.",
      "The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil\nclaimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\ngenerously returned.",
      "Then they came to the door, and from their\nconversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on\nthe moors.",
      "I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw s\nheart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions\nif I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and\nfeeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the\nkitchen.",
      "There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at\nthe door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which\nwas often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and\nintolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.",
      "I d rayther, by th  haulf, hev   em swearing i  my lugs fro h morn to\nneeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!",
      "said the tenant of the kitchen, in\nanswer to an unheard speech of Nelly s.  It s a blazing shame, that I\ncannot oppen t  blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan,\nand all t  flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th  warld!",
      "Oh!",
      "ye re a raight nowt; and shoo s another; and that poor lad  ll be\nlost atween ye.",
      "Poor lad!",
      "he added, with a groan;  he s witched: I m\nsartin on t. Oh, Lord, judge  em, for there s norther law nor justice\namong wer rullers!",
      "No!",
      "or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,  retorted\nthe singer.",
      "But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian,\nand never mind me.",
      "This is  Fairy Annie s Wedding a bonny tune it goes\nto a dance.",
      "Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\ndirectly, she jumped to her feet, crying Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!",
      "How could you think of returning in this way?",
      "All s shut up at\nThrushcross Grange.",
      "You should have given us notice!",
      "I ve arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay, \nI answered.",
      "I depart again to-morrow.",
      "And how are you transplanted\nhere, Mrs. Dean?",
      "tell me that.",
      "Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\nto London, and stay till you returned.",
      "But, step in, pray!",
      "Have you\nwalked from Gimmerton this evening?",
      "From the Grange,  I replied;  and while they make me lodging room\nthere, I want to finish my business with your master; because I don t\nthink of having another opportunity in a hurry.",
      "What business, sir?",
      "said Nelly, conducting me into the house.",
      "He s\ngone out at present, and won t return soon.",
      "About the rent,  I answered.",
      "Oh!",
      "then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,  she observed;\n or rather with me.",
      "She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I\nact for her: there s nobody else.",
      "I looked surprised.",
      "Ah!",
      "you have not heard of Heathcliff s death, I see,  she continued.",
      "Heathcliff dead!",
      "I exclaimed, astonished.",
      "How long ago?",
      "Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I ll\ntell you all about it.",
      "Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?",
      "I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.",
      "You sit down too.",
      "I\nnever dreamt of his dying!",
      "Let me hear how it came to pass.",
      "You say you\ndon t expect them back for some time the young people?",
      "No I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\ndon t care for me.",
      "At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do\nyou good: you seem weary.",
      "She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph\nasking whether  it warn t a crying scandal that she should have\nfollowers at her time of life?",
      "And then, to get them jocks out o  t \nmaister s cellar!",
      "He fair shaamed to  bide still and see it.",
      "She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\nreaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.",
      "And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff s\nhistory.",
      "He had a  queer  end, as she expressed it.",
      "* * * * *\n\n\nI was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\nus, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine s sake.",
      "My first\ninterview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much\nsince our separation.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for\ntaking a new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me,\nand he was tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\nsitting-room, and keep her with me.",
      "It was enough if he were obliged to\nsee her once or twice a day.",
      "She seemed pleased at this arrangement;\nand, by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other\narticles, that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered\nmyself we should get on in tolerable comfort.",
      "The delusion did not last\nlong.",
      "Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable\nand restless.",
      "For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the\ngarden, and it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as\nspring drew on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to\nquit her frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred\nquarrelling with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her\nsolitude.",
      "I did not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often\nobliged to seek the kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the\nhouse to himself; and though in the beginning she either left it at his\napproach, or quietly joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or\naddressing him and though he was always as sullen and silent as\npossible after a while, she changed her behaviour, and became incapable\nof letting him alone: talking at him; commenting on his stupidity and\nidleness; expressing her wonder how he could endure the life he\nlived how he could sit a whole evening staring into the fire, and\ndozing.",
      "He s just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?",
      "she once observed,  or a\ncart-horse?",
      "He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally!",
      "What\na blank, dreary mind he must have!",
      "Do you ever dream, Hareton?",
      "And, if\nyou do, what is it about?",
      "But you can t speak to me!",
      "Then she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\nagain.",
      "He s, perhaps, dreaming now,  she continued.",
      "He twitched his shoulder\nas Juno twitches hers.",
      "Ask him, Ellen.",
      "Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you upstairs, if you don t\nbehave!",
      "I said.",
      "He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\nfist, as if tempted to use it.",
      "I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,  she\nexclaimed, on another occasion.",
      "He is afraid I shall laugh at him.",
      "Ellen, what do you think?",
      "He began to teach himself to read once; and,\nbecause I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\nfool?",
      "Were not you naughty?",
      "I said;  answer me that.",
      "Perhaps I was,  she went on;  but I did not expect him to be so silly.",
      "Hareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?",
      "I ll try!",
      "She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\nmuttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.",
      "Well, I shall put it here,  she said,  in the table-drawer; and I m\ngoing to bed.",
      "Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.",
      "But\nhe would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\ngreat disappointment.",
      "I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\nand indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\nimproving himself: she had done it effectually.",
      "But her ingenuity was\nat work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\nstationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\nbring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.",
      "When Hareton was\nthere, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\nlying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a\nmule, and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to\nsmoking with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of\nthe fire, the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense,\nas he would have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to\ndisregard it.",
      "On fine evenings the latter followed his shooting\nexpeditions, and Catherine yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to\nher, and ran off into the court or garden the moment I began; and, as a\nlast resource, cried, and said she was tired of living: her life was\nuseless.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had\nalmost banished Earnshaw from his apartment.",
      "Owing to an accident at\nthe commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the\nkitchen.",
      "His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter\ncut his arm, and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach\nhome.",
      "The consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the\nfireside and tranquillity, till he made it up again.",
      "It suited\nCatherine to have him there: at any rate, it made her hate her room\nupstairs more than ever: and she would compel me to find out business\nbelow, that she might accompany me.",
      "On Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and,\nin the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.",
      "Earnshaw\nsat, morose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\nbeguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes,\nvarying her amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered\nejaculations, and quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the\ndirection of her cousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the\ngrate.",
      "At a notice that I could do with her no longer intercepting my\nlight, she removed to the hearthstone.",
      "I bestowed little attention on\nher proceedings, but, presently, I heard her begin I ve found out,\nHareton, that I want that I m glad that I should like you to be my\ncousin now, if you had not grown so cross to me, and so rough.",
      "Hareton returned no answer.",
      "Hareton, Hareton, Hareton!",
      "do you hear?",
      "she continued.",
      "Get off wi  ye!",
      "he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.",
      "Let me take that pipe,  she said, cautiously advancing her hand and\nabstracting it from his mouth.",
      "Before he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the\nfire.",
      "He swore at her and seized another.",
      "Stop,  she cried,  you must listen to me first; and I can t speak\nwhile those clouds are floating in my face.",
      "Will you go to the devil!",
      "he exclaimed, ferociously,  and let me be!",
      "No,  she persisted,  I won t: I can t tell what to do to make you talk\nto me; and you are determined not to understand.",
      "When I call you\nstupid, I don t mean anything: I don t mean that I despise you.",
      "Come,\nyou shall take notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall\nown me.",
      "I shall have naught to do wi  you and your mucky pride, and your\ndamned mocking tricks!",
      "he answered.",
      "I ll go to hell, body and soul,\nbefore I look sideways after you again.",
      "Side out o  t  gate, now, this\nminute!",
      "Catherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip,\nand endeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing\ntendency to sob.",
      "You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,  I interrupted,\n since she repents of her sauciness.",
      "It would do you a great deal of\ngood: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.",
      "A companion!",
      "he cried;  when she hates me, and does not think me fit\nto wipe her shoon!",
      "Nay, if it made me a king, I d not be scorned for\nseeking her good-will any more.",
      "It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!",
      "wept Cathy, no\nlonger disguising her trouble.",
      "You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff\ndoes, and more.",
      "You re a damned liar,  began Earnshaw:  why have I made him angry, by\ntaking your part, then, a hundred times?",
      "and that when you sneered at\nand despised me, and Go on plaguing me, and I ll step in yonder, and\nsay you worried me out of the kitchen!",
      "I didn t know you took my part,  she answered, drying her eyes;  and I\nwas miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you\nto forgive me: what can I do besides?",
      "She returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.",
      "He blackened\nand scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely\nclenched, and his gaze fixed on the ground.",
      "Catherine, by instinct,\nmust have divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that\nprompted this dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant\nundecided, she stooped and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.",
      "The\nlittle rogue thought I had not seen her, and, drawing back, she took\nher former station by the window, quite demurely.",
      "I shook my head\nreprovingly, and then she blushed and whispered Well!",
      "what should I\nhave done, Ellen?",
      "He wouldn t shake hands, and he wouldn t look: I must\nshow him some way that I like him that I want to be friends.",
      "Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,\nfor some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did\nraise it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.",
      "Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white\npaper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to\n Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,  she desired me to be her ambassadress, and\nconvey the present to its destined recipient.",
      "And tell him, if he ll take it, I ll come and teach him to read it\nright,  she said;  and, if he refuse it, I ll go upstairs, and never\ntease him again.",
      "I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my\nemployer.",
      "Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.",
      "He did not strike it off, either.",
      "I returned to my work.",
      "Catherine\nleaned her head and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle\nof the covering being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated\nherself beside her cousin.",
      "He trembled, and his face glowed: all his\nrudeness and all his surly harshness had deserted him: he could not\nsummon courage, at first, to utter a syllable in reply to her\nquestioning look, and her murmured petition.",
      "Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.",
      "You can make me so happy by speaking\nthat little word.",
      "He muttered something inaudible.",
      "And you ll be my friend?",
      "added Catherine, interrogatively.",
      "Nay, you ll be ashamed of me every day of your life,  he answered;\n and the more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.",
      "So you won t be my friend?",
      "she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and\ncreeping close up.",
      "I overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round\nagain, I perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of\nthe accepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on\nboth sides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.",
      "The work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their\nposition had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.",
      "He, poor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated\non the same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his\nshoulder; and confounded at his favourite s endurance of her proximity:\nit affected him too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that\nnight.",
      "His emotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as\nhe solemnly spread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with\ndirty bank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day s\ntransactions.",
      "At length he summoned Hareton from his seat.",
      "Tak  these in to t  maister, lad,  he said,  and bide there.",
      "I s gang\nup to my own rahm.",
      "This hoile s neither mensful nor seemly for us: we\nmun side out and seearch another.",
      "Come, Catherine,  I said,  we must  side out  too: I ve done my\nironing.",
      "Are you ready to go?",
      "It is not eight o clock!",
      "she answered, rising unwillingly.",
      "Hareton,\nI ll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I ll bring some more\nto-morrow.",
      "Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak  into th  hahse,  said Joseph,\n and it ll be mitch if yah find  em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!",
      "Cathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as\nshe passed Hareton, went singing upstairs: lighter of heart, I venture\nto say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,\nduring her earliest visits to Linton.",
      "The intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered\ntemporary interruptions.",
      "Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish,\nand my young lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but\nboth their minds tending to the same point one loving and desiring to\nesteem, and the other loving and desiring to be esteemed they contrived\nin the end to reach it.",
      "You see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff s\nheart.",
      "But now, I m glad you did not try.",
      "The crown of all my wishes\nwill be the union of those two.",
      "I shall envy no one on their wedding\nday: there won t be a happier woman than myself in England!",
      "CHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOn the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his\nordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I\nspeedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me,\nas heretofore.",
      "She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden,\nwhere she had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I\nwent to bid them come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to\nclear a large space of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and\nthey were busy planning together an importation of plants from the\nGrange.",
      "I was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a\nbrief half-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph s\neye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of\nthem.",
      "There!",
      "That will be all shown to the master,  I exclaimed,  the minute\nit is discovered.",
      "And what excuse have you to offer for taking such\nliberties with the garden?",
      "We shall have a fine explosion on the head\nof it: see if we don t!",
      "Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more\nwit than to go and make that mess at her bidding!",
      "I d forgotten they were Joseph s,  answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;\n but I ll tell him I did it.",
      "We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "I held the mistress s post\nin making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.",
      "Catherine\nusually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I\npresently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than\nshe had in her hostility.",
      "Now, mind you don t talk with and notice your cousin too much,  were\nmy whispered instructions as we entered the room.",
      "It will certainly\nannoy Mr. Heathcliff, and he ll be mad at you both.",
      "I m not going to,  she answered.",
      "The minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in\nhis plate of porridge.",
      "He dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went\non teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.",
      "I frowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was\noccupied on other subjects than his company, as his countenance\nevinced; and she grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with\ndeep gravity.",
      "Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at\nlast, Hareton uttered a smothered laugh.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff started; his\neye rapidly surveyed our faces.",
      "Catherine met it with her accustomed\nlook of nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.",
      "It is well you are out of my reach,  he exclaimed.",
      "What fiend\npossesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal\neyes?",
      "Down with them!",
      "and don t remind me of your existence again.",
      "I\nthought I had cured you of laughing.",
      "It was me,  muttered Hareton.",
      "What do you say?",
      "demanded the master.",
      "Hareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.",
      "Mr.\nHeathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast\nand his interrupted musing.",
      "We had nearly finished, and the two young\npeople prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further\ndisturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,\nrevealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage\ncommitted on his precious shrubs was detected.",
      "He must have seen Cathy\nand her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws\nworked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech\ndifficult to understand, he began: \n\n I mun hev  my wage, and I mun goa!",
      "I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I d\nsarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I d lug my books up into t  garret,\nand all my bits o  stuff, and they sud hev  t  kitchen to theirseln;\nfor t  sake o  quietness.",
      "It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but\nI thowt I _could_ do that!",
      "But nah, shoo s taan my garden fro  me, and\nby th  heart, maister, I cannot stand it!",
      "Yah may bend to th  yoak an\nye will I noan used to  t, and an old man doesn t sooin get used to new\nbarthens.",
      "I d rayther arn my bite an  my sup wi  a hammer in th  road!",
      "Now, now, idiot!",
      "interrupted Heathcliff,  cut it short!",
      "What s your\ngrievance?",
      "I ll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.",
      "She may\nthrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.",
      "It s noan Nelly!",
      "answered Joseph.",
      "I sudn t shift for Nelly nasty ill\nnowt as shoo is.",
      "Thank God!",
      "_shoo_ cannot stale t  sowl o  nob dy!",
      "Shoo\nwer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her  bout winking.",
      "It s yon flaysome, graceless quean, that s witched our lad, wi  her\nbold een and her forrard ways till Nay!",
      "it fair brusts my heart!",
      "He s\nforgotten all I ve done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up\na whole row o  t  grandest currant-trees i  t  garden!",
      "and here he\nlamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and\nEarnshaw s ingratitude and dangerous condition.",
      "Is the fool drunk?",
      "asked Mr. Heathcliff.",
      "Hareton, is it you he s\nfinding fault with?",
      "I ve pulled up two or three bushes,  replied the young man;  but I m\ngoing to set  em again.",
      "And why have you pulled them up?",
      "said the master.",
      "Catherine wisely put in her tongue.",
      "We wanted to plant some flowers there,  she cried.",
      "I m the only\nperson to blame, for I wished him to do it.",
      "And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?",
      "demanded her father-in-law, much surprised.",
      "And who ordered _you_ to\nobey her?",
      "he added, turning to Hareton.",
      "The latter was speechless; his cousin replied You shouldn t grudge a\nfew yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my\nland!",
      "Your land, insolent slut!",
      "You never had any,  said Heathcliff.",
      "And my money,  she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime\nbiting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.",
      "Silence!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "Get done, and begone!",
      "And Hareton s land, and his money,  pursued the reckless thing.",
      "Hareton and I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!",
      "The master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up,\neyeing her all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.",
      "If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,  she said;  so you may as\nwell sit down.",
      "If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I ll strike him to\nhell,  thundered Heathcliff.",
      "Damnable witch!",
      "dare you pretend to rouse\nhim against me?",
      "Off with her!",
      "Do you hear?",
      "Fling her into the kitchen!",
      "I ll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!",
      "Hareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.",
      "Drag her away!",
      "he cried, savagely.",
      "Are you staying to talk?",
      "And he\napproached to execute his own command.",
      "He ll not obey you, wicked man, any more,  said Catherine;  and he ll\nsoon detest you as much as I do.",
      "Wisht!",
      "wisht!",
      "muttered the young man, reproachfully;  I will not hear\nyou speak so to him.",
      "Have done.",
      "But you won t let him strike me?",
      "she cried.",
      "Come, then,  he whispered earnestly.",
      "It was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.",
      "Now, _you_ go!",
      "he said to Earnshaw.",
      "Accursed witch!",
      "this time she\nhas provoked me when I could not bear it; and I ll make her repent it\nfor ever!",
      "He had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,\nentreating him not to hurt her that once.",
      "Heathcliff s black eyes\nflashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just\nworked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers\nrelaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed\nintently in her face.",
      "Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a\nmoment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,\nsaid, with assumed calmness You must learn to avoid putting me in a\npassion, or I shall really murder you some time!",
      "Go with Mrs. Dean, and\nkeep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears.",
      "As to Hareton\nEarnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I ll send him seeking his bread\nwhere he can get it!",
      "Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.",
      "Nelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!",
      "Leave me!",
      "I led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the\nother followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.",
      "I had counselled Catherine to dine upstairs; but, as soon as he\nperceived her vacant seat, he sent me to call her.",
      "He spoke to none of\nus, ate very little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that\nhe should not return before evening.",
      "The two new friends established themselves in the house during his\nabsence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her\noffering a revelation of her father-in-law s conduct to his father.",
      "He\nsaid he wouldn t suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if\nhe were the devil, it didn t signify; he would stand by him; and he d\nrather she would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr.\nHeathcliff.",
      "Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to\nmake her hold her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak\nill of her father?",
      "Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the\nmaster s reputation home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger\nthan reason could break chains, forged by habit, which it would be\ncruel to attempt to loosen.",
      "She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in\navoiding both complaints and expressions of antipathy concerning\nHeathcliff; and confessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to\nraise a bad spirit between him and Hareton: indeed, I don t believe she\nhas ever breathed a syllable, in the latter s hearing, against her\noppressor since.",
      "When this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as\nbusy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.",
      "I\ncame in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so\nsoothed and comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got\non.",
      "You know, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long\nbeen proud of one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of\nequal satisfaction.",
      "His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off\nrapidly the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been\nbred; and Catherine s sincere commendations acted as a spur to his\nindustry.",
      "His brightening mind brightened his features, and added\nspirit and nobility to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same\nindividual I had beheld on the day I discovered my little lady at\nWuthering Heights, after her expedition to the Crags.",
      "While I admired\nand they laboured, dusk drew on, and with it returned the master.",
      "He\ncame upon us quite unexpectedly, entering by the front way, and had a\nfull view of the whole three, ere we could raise our heads to glance at\nhim.",
      "Well, I reflected, there was never a pleasanter, or more harmless\nsight; and it will be a burning shame to scold them.",
      "The red fire-light\nglowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with\nthe eager interest of children; for, though he was twenty-three and she\neighteen, each had so much of novelty to feel and learn, that neither\nexperienced nor evinced the sentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.",
      "They lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps\nyou have never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they\nare those of Catherine Earnshaw.",
      "The present Catherine has no other\nlikeness to her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of\nthe nostril that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or\nnot.",
      "With Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at\nall times, _then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were\nalert, and his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.",
      "I suppose\nthis resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in\nevident agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young\nman: or, I should say, altered its character; for it was there yet.",
      "He\ntook the book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then\nreturned it without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her\ncompanion lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart\nalso, but he bid me sit still.",
      "It is a poor conclusion, is it not?",
      "he observed, having brooded\na while on the scene he had just witnessed:  an absurd termination to\nmy violent exertions?",
      "I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two\nhouses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and\nwhen everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a\nslate off either roof has vanished!",
      "My old enemies have not beaten me;\nnow would be the precise time to revenge myself on their\nrepresentatives: I could do it; and none could hinder me.",
      "But where is\nthe use?",
      "I don t care for striking: I can t take the trouble to raise\nmy hand!",
      "That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to\nexhibit a fine trait of magnanimity.",
      "It is far from being the case: I\nhave lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle\nto destroy for nothing.",
      "Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I m in its shadow at\npresent.",
      "I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly\nremember to eat and drink.",
      "Those two who have left the room are the\nonly objects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and\nthat appearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.",
      "About _her_ I won t\nspeak; and I don t desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were\ninvisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations.",
      "_He_ moves\nme differently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I d\nnever see him again!",
      "You ll perhaps think me rather inclined to become\nso,  he added, making an effort to smile,  if I try to describe the\nthousand forms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.",
      "But you ll not talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally\nsecluded in itself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.",
      "Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a\nhuman being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would\nhave been impossible to have accosted him rationally.",
      "In the first\nplace, his startling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with\nher.",
      "That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my\nimagination, is actually the least: for what is not connected with her\nto me?",
      "and what does not recall her?",
      "I cannot look down to this floor,\nbut her features are shaped in the flags!",
      "In every cloud, in every\ntree filling the air at night, and caught by glimpses in every object\nby day I am surrounded with her image!",
      "The most ordinary faces of men\nand women my own features mock me with a resemblance.",
      "The entire world\nis a dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I\nhave lost her!",
      "Well, Hareton s aspect was the ghost of my immortal\nlove; of my wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride,\nmy happiness, and my anguish \n\n But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\nknow why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\nbenefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it\npartly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\ntogether.",
      "I can give them no attention any more.",
      "But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "I said, alarmed\nat his manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses,\nnor dying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy;\nand, as to his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on\ndark things, and entertaining odd fancies.",
      "He might have had a\nmonomania on the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point\nhis wits were as sound as mine.",
      "I shall not know that till it comes,  he said;  I m only half\nconscious of it now.",
      "You have no feeling of illness, have you?",
      "I asked.",
      "No, Nelly, I have not,  he answered.",
      "Then you are not afraid of death?",
      "I pursued.",
      "Afraid?",
      "No!",
      "he replied.",
      "I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,\nnor a hope of death.",
      "Why should I?",
      "With my hard constitution and\ntemperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and\nprobably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black\nhair on my head.",
      "And yet I cannot continue in this condition!",
      "I have to\nremind myself to breathe almost to remind my heart to beat!",
      "And it is\nlike bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the\nslightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I\nnotice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one\nuniversal idea.",
      "I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties\nare yearning to attain it.",
      "They have yearned towards it so long, and so\nunwaveringly, that I m convinced it _will_ be reached and\n_soon_ because it has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the\nanticipation of its fulfilment.",
      "My confessions have not relieved me;\nbut they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour\nwhich I show.",
      "O God!",
      "It is a long fight; I wish it were over!",
      "He began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I\nwas inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had\nturned his heart to an earthly hell.",
      "I wondered greatly how it would\nend.",
      "Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by\nlooks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it\nhimself; but not a soul, from his general bearing, would have\nconjectured the fact.",
      "You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and\nat the period of which I speak, he was just the same as then; only\nfonder of continued solitude, and perhaps still more laconic in\ncompany.",
      "CHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nFor some days after that evening, Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at\nmeals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.",
      "He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing\nrather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed\nsufficient sustenance for him.",
      "One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and\nout at the front door.",
      "I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning\nI found he was still away.",
      "We were in April then: the weather was sweet\nand warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the\ntwo dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.",
      "After\nbreakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with\nmy work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled\nHareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and\narrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the\ninfluence of Joseph s complaints.",
      "I was comfortably revelling in the\nspring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my\nyoung lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose\nroots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.\nHeathcliff was coming in.",
      "And he spoke to me,  she added, with a\nperplexed countenance.",
      "What did he say?",
      "asked Hareton.",
      "He told me to begone as fast as I could,  she answered.",
      "But he looked\nso different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at\nhim.",
      "How?",
      "he inquired.",
      "Why, almost bright and cheerful.",
      "No, _almost_ nothing _very much_\nexcited, and wild, and glad!",
      "she replied.",
      "Night-walking amuses him, then,  I remarked, affecting a careless\nmanner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain\nthe truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would\nnot be an every-day spectacle.",
      "I framed an excuse to go in.",
      "Heathcliff\nstood at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly,\nhe had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of\nhis whole face.",
      "Will you have some breakfast?",
      "I said.",
      "You must be hungry, rambling\nabout all night!",
      "I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not\nlike to ask directly.",
      "No, I m not hungry,  he answered, averting his head, and speaking\nrather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the\noccasion of his good humour.",
      "I felt perplexed: I didn t know whether it were not a proper\nopportunity to offer a bit of admonition.",
      "I don t think it right to wander out of doors,  I observed,  instead\nof being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.",
      "I\ndaresay you ll catch a bad cold, or a fever: you have something the\nmatter with you now!",
      "Nothing but what I can bear,  he replied;  and with the greatest\npleasure, provided you ll leave me alone: get in, and don t annoy me.",
      "I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.",
      "Yes!",
      "I reflected to myself,  we shall have a fit of illness.",
      "I cannot\nconceive what he has been doing.",
      "That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate\nfrom my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.",
      "I ve neither cold nor fever, Nelly,  he remarked, in allusion to my\nmorning s speech;  and I m ready to do justice to the food you give\nme.",
      "He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the\ninclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.",
      "He laid them on the\ntable, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.",
      "We\nsaw him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal,\nand Earnshaw said he d go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we\nhad grieved him some way.",
      "Well, is he coming?",
      "cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.",
      "Nay,  he answered;  but he s not angry: he seemed rarely pleased\nindeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he\nbid me be off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of\nanybody else.",
      "I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he\nre-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same\nunnatural it was unnatural appearance of joy under his black brows; the\nsame bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of\nsmile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,\nbut as a tight-stretched cord vibrates a strong thrilling, rather than\ntrembling.",
      "I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?",
      "And I\nexclaimed Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "You look\nuncommonly animated.",
      "Where should good news come from to me?",
      "he said.",
      "I m animated with\nhunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.",
      "Your dinner is here,  I returned;  why won t you get it?",
      "I don t want it now,  he muttered, hastily:  I ll wait till supper.",
      "And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other\naway from me.",
      "I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this\nplace to myself.",
      "Is there some new reason for this banishment?",
      "I inquired.",
      "Tell me\nwhy you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff?",
      "Where were you last night?",
      "I m\nnot putting the question through idle curiosity, but \n\n You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,  he\ninterrupted, with a laugh.",
      "Yet I ll answer it.",
      "Last night I was on the\nthreshold of hell.",
      "To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.",
      "I have my\neyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!",
      "And now you d better go!",
      "You ll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain\nfrom prying.",
      "Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed\nthan ever.",
      "He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on\nhis solitude; till, at eight o clock, I deemed it proper, though\nunsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.",
      "He was leaning\nagainst the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was\nturned to the interior gloom.",
      "The fire had smouldered to ashes; the\nroom was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so\nstill, that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was\ndistinguishable, but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or\nthrough the large stones which it could not cover.",
      "I uttered an\nejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced\nshutting the casements, one after another, till I came to his.",
      "Must I close this?",
      "I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not\nstir.",
      "The light flashed on his features as I spoke.",
      "Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I\ncannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!",
      "Those\ndeep black eyes!",
      "That smile, and ghastly paleness!",
      "It appeared to me,\nnot Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle\nbend towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.",
      "Yes, close it,  he replied, in his familiar voice.",
      "There, that is\npure awkwardness!",
      "Why did you hold the candle horizontally?",
      "Be quick,\nand bring another.",
      "I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph The\nmaster wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.",
      "For I\ndared not go in myself again just then.",
      "Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it\nback immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining\nthat Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till\nmorning.",
      "We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to\nhis ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its\nwindow, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get\nthrough; and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion,\nof which he had rather we had no suspicion.",
      "Is he a ghoul or a vampire?",
      "I mused.",
      "I had read of such hideous\nincarnate demons.",
      "And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him\nin infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost\nthrough his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to\nthat sense of horror.",
      "But where did he come from, the little dark\nthing, harboured by a good man to his bane?",
      "muttered Superstition, as\nI dozed into unconsciousness.",
      "And I began, half dreaming, to weary\nmyself with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my\nwaking meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim\nvariations; at last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I\ncan remember is, being exceedingly vexed at having the task of\ndictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the sexton\nabout it; and, as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age, we\nwere obliged to content ourselves with the single word,  Heathcliff.",
      "That came true: we were.",
      "If you enter the kirkyard, you ll read, on his\nheadstone, only that, and the date of his death.",
      "Dawn restored me to common sense.",
      "I rose, and went into the garden, as\nsoon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his\nwindow.",
      "There were none.",
      "He has stayed at home,  I thought,  and he ll\nbe all right to-day.",
      "I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my\nusual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the\nmaster came down, for he lay late.",
      "They preferred taking it out of\ndoors, under the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.",
      "On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.",
      "He and Joseph were\nconversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute\ndirections concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and\nturned his head continually aside, and had the same excited expression,\neven more exaggerated.",
      "When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in\nthe place he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.",
      "He drew it nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at\nthe opposite wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up\nand down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest\nthat he stopped breathing during half a minute together.",
      "Come now,  I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand,  eat and\ndrink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.",
      "He didn t notice me, and yet he smiled.",
      "I d rather have seen him gnash\nhis teeth than smile so.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff!",
      "master!",
      "I cried,  don t, for God s sake, stare as if\nyou saw an unearthly vision.",
      "Don t, for God s sake, shout so loud,  he replied.",
      "Turn round, and\ntell me, are we by ourselves?",
      "Of course,  was my answer;  of course we are.",
      "Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.",
      "With a\nsweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the\nbreakfast things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.",
      "Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded\nhim alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two\nyards  distance.",
      "And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both\npleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet\nraptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.",
      "The\nfancied object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with\nunwearied diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned\naway.",
      "I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if\nhe stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he\nstretched his hand out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched\nbefore they reached it, and remained on the table, forgetful of their\naim.",
      "I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention\nfrom its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up,\nasking why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his\nmeals?",
      "and saying that on the next occasion I needn t wait: I might set\nthe things down and go.",
      "Having uttered these words he left the house,\nslowly sauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the\ngate.",
      "The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.",
      "I did not retire to\nrest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.",
      "He returned after\nmidnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room\nbeneath.",
      "I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and\ndescended.",
      "It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a\nhundred idle misgivings.",
      "I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff s step, restlessly measuring the floor,\nand he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a\ngroan.",
      "He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was\nthe name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or\nsuffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and\nearnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.",
      "I had not courage to\nwalk straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his\nreverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and\nbegan to scrape the cinders.",
      "It drew him forth sooner than I expected.",
      "He opened the door immediately, and said Nelly, come here is it\nmorning?",
      "Come in with your light.",
      "It is striking four,  I answered.",
      "You want a candle to take upstairs:\nyou might have lit one at this fire.",
      "No, I don t wish to go upstairs,  he said.",
      "Come in, and kindle _me_ a\nfire, and do anything there is to do about the room.",
      "I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,  I replied,\ngetting a chair and the bellows.",
      "He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his\nheavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for\ncommon breathing between.",
      "When day breaks I ll send for Green,  he said;  I wish to make some\nlegal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters,\nand while I can act calmly.",
      "I have not written my will yet; and how to\nleave my property I cannot determine.",
      "I wish I could annihilate it from\nthe face of the earth.",
      "I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,  I interposed.",
      "Let your will be\na while: you ll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet!",
      "I\nnever expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at\npresent, marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own\nfault.",
      "The way you ve passed these three last days might knock up a\nTitan.",
      "Do take some food, and some repose.",
      "You need only look at\nyourself in a glass to see how you require both.",
      "Your cheeks are\nhollow, and your eyes blood-shot, like a person starving with hunger\nand going blind with loss of sleep.",
      "It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,  he replied.",
      "I assure\nyou it is through no settled designs.",
      "I ll do both, as soon as I\npossibly can.",
      "But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water\nrest within arms  length of the shore!",
      "I must reach it first, and then\nI ll rest.",
      "Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my\ninjustices, I ve done no injustice, and I repent of nothing.",
      "I m too\nhappy; and yet I m not happy enough.",
      "My soul s bliss kills my body, but\ndoes not satisfy itself.",
      "Happy, master?",
      "I cried.",
      "Strange happiness!",
      "If you would hear me\nwithout being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you\nhappier.",
      "What is that?",
      "he asked.",
      "Give it.",
      "You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,  I said,  that from the time you were\nthirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and\nprobably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.",
      "You\nmust have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have\nspace to search it now.",
      "Could it be hurtful to send for some one some\nminister of any denomination, it does not matter which to explain it,\nand show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how\nunfit you will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before\nyou die?",
      "I m rather obliged than angry, Nelly,  he said,  for you remind me of\nthe manner in which I desire to be buried.",
      "It is to be carried to the\nchurchyard in the evening.",
      "You and Hareton may, if you please,\naccompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys\nmy directions concerning the two coffins!",
      "No minister need come; nor\nneed anything be said over me.",
      "I tell you I have nearly attained _my_\nheaven; and that of others is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.",
      "And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that\nmeans, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?",
      "I\nsaid, shocked at his godless indifference.",
      "How would you like it?",
      "They won t do that,  he replied:  if they did, you must have me\nremoved secretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically,\nthat the dead are not annihilated!",
      "As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired\nto his den, and I breathed freer.",
      "But in the afternoon, while Joseph\nand Hareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and,\nwith a wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody\nwith him.",
      "I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and\nmanner frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be\nhis companion alone.",
      "I believe you think me a fiend,  he said, with his dismal laugh:\n something too horrible to live under a decent roof.",
      "Then turning to\nCatherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he\nadded, half sneeringly, Will _you_ come, chuck?",
      "I ll not hurt you.",
      "No!",
      "to you I ve made myself worse than the devil.",
      "Well, there is _one_ who\nwon t shrink from my company!",
      "By God!",
      "she s relentless.",
      "Oh, damn it!",
      "It s unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear even mine.",
      "He solicited the society of no one more.",
      "At dusk he went into his\nchamber.",
      "Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard\nhim groaning and murmuring to himself.",
      "Hareton was anxious to enter;\nbut I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.",
      "When\nhe came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found\nit locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.",
      "He was better, and would be\nleft alone; so the doctor went away.",
      "The following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till\nday-dawn; and, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed\nthe master s window swinging open, and the rain driving straight in.",
      "He\ncannot be in bed, I thought: those showers would drench him through.",
      "He\nmust either be up or out.",
      "But I ll make no more ado, I ll go boldly and\nlook.",
      "Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to\nunclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them\naside, I peeped in.",
      "Mr. Heathcliff was there laid on his back.",
      "His eyes\nmet mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.",
      "I\ncould not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with\nrain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.",
      "The lattice,\nflapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no\nblood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I\ncould doubt no more: he was dead and stark!",
      "I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I\ntried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,\nlife-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it.",
      "They would\nnot shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and\nsharp white teeth sneered too!",
      "Taken with another fit of cowardice, I\ncried out for Joseph.",
      "Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but\nresolutely refused to meddle with him.",
      "Th  divil s harried off his soul,  he cried,  and he may hev  his\ncarcass into t  bargin, for aught I care!",
      "Ech!",
      "what a wicked  un he\nlooks, girning at death!",
      "and the old sinner grinned in mockery.",
      "I\nthought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly\ncomposing himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and\nreturned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were\nrestored to their rights.",
      "I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred\nto former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.",
      "But poor Hareton,\nthe most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.",
      "He sat by\nthe corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.",
      "He pressed its hand,\nand kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from\ncontemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs\nnaturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.",
      "Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master\ndied.",
      "I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four\ndays, fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he\ndid not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange\nillness, not the cause.",
      "We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.",
      "Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin,\ncomprehended the whole attendance.",
      "The six men departed when they had\nlet it down into the grave: we stayed to see it covered.",
      "Hareton, with\na streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould\nhimself: at present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion\nmounds and I hope its tenant sleeps as soundly.",
      "But the country folks,\nif you ask them, would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are\nthose who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and\neven within this house.",
      "Idle tales, you ll say, and so say I.",
      "Yet that\nold man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on  em looking out\nof his chamber window on every rainy night since his death: and an odd\nthing happened to me about a month ago.",
      "I was going to the Grange one\nevening a dark evening, threatening thunder and, just at the turn of\nthe Heights, I encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs\nbefore him; he was crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were\nskittish, and would not be guided.",
      "What is the matter, my little man?",
      "I asked.",
      "There s Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t  nab,  he blubbered,\n un  I darnut pass  em.",
      "I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I bid him\ntake the road lower down.",
      "He probably raised the phantoms from\nthinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard\nhis parents and companions repeat.",
      "Yet, still, I don t like being out\nin the dark now; and I don t like being left by myself in this grim\nhouse: I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift\nto the Grange.",
      "They are going to the Grange, then?",
      "I said.",
      "Yes,  answered Mrs. Dean,  as soon as they are married, and that will\nbe on New Year s Day.",
      "And who will live here then?",
      "Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep\nhim company.",
      "They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut\nup.",
      "For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?",
      "I observed.",
      "No, Mr. Lockwood,  said Nelly, shaking her head.",
      "I believe the dead\nare at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.",
      "At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.",
      "_They_ are afraid of nothing,  I grumbled, watching their approach\nthrough the window.",
      "Together, they would brave Satan and all his\nlegions.",
      "As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look\nat the moon or, more correctly, at each other by her light I felt\nirresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance\ninto the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my\nrudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;\nand so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his\nfellow-servant s gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised\nme for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his\nfeet.",
      "My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the\nkirk.",
      "When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even\nin seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and\nslates jutted off, here and there, beyond the right line of the roof,\nto be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.",
      "I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next\nthe moor: the middle one grey, and half buried in heath; Edgar Linton s\nonly harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff s\nstill bare.",
      "I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths\nfluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind\nbreathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever\nimagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth."

      "Letter 1\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\n\nSt. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17 .",
      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\ncommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil\nforebodings.",
      "I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight.",
      "Do you understand this\nfeeling?",
      "This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid.",
      "I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight.",
      "There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour.",
      "There for with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigators there snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe.",
      "Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes.",
      "What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?",
      "I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.",
      "I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man.",
      "These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river.",
      "But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",
      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye.",
      "This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.",
      "I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole.",
      "You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas  library.",
      "My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading.",
      "These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father s dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.",
      "I also\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.",
      "You are well\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.",
      "I\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\ngreat enterprise.",
      "I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.",
      "I\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\nthe greatest practical advantage.",
      "Twice I actually hired myself as an\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.",
      "I\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path.",
      "Oh, that some encouraging\nvoice would answer in the affirmative!",
      "My courage and my resolution is\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.",
      "I am\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.",
      "They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.",
      "The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which I have\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.",
      "I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\nArchangel.",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",
      "I do not intend to\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return?",
      "Ah, dear sister, how\ncan I answer this question?",
      "If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\nwill pass before you and I may meet.",
      "If I fail, you will see me again soon,\nor never.",

      "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!",
      "Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.",
      "I have hired a\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.",
      "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",
      "I shall commit my thoughts\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\nfeeling.",
      "I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\neyes would reply to mine.",
      "You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\nbitterly feel the want of a friend.",
      "I have no one near me, gentle yet\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.",
      "How would such a\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother!",
      "I am too ardent in execution\nand too impatient of difficulties.",
      "But it is a still greater evil to me\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas  books of voyages.",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\ncountry.",
      "Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\nschoolboys of fifteen.",
      "It is true that I have thought more and that my\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\nendeavour to regulate my mind.",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.",
      "Yet\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\nrugged bosoms.",
      "My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession.",
      "He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity.",
      "I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\nin my enterprise.",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.",
      "This\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\nme very desirous to engage him.",
      "A youth passed in solitude, my best years\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.",
      "I heard\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\nhappiness of her life.",
      "This, briefly, is his story.",
      "Some years ago he loved\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.",
      "He saw\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\nand that her father would never consent to the union.",
      "My generous friend\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit.",
      "He had already bought a farm with his\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\nwoman s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.",
      "But the old\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\ninclinations.",
      "What a noble fellow!",
      "you will exclaim.",
      "He is\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\notherwise he would command.",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions.",
      "Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.",
      "The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected.",
      "I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking.",
      "It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\nI am preparing to depart.",
      "I am going to unexplored regions, to  the\nland of mist and snow,  but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the  Ancient Mariner.",
      "You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret.",
      "I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets.",
      "There is something\nat work in my soul which I do not understand.",
      "I am practically\nindustrious painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabour but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.",
      "But to return to dearer considerations.",
      "Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America?",
      "I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture.",
      "Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits.",
      "I love you very tenderly.",
      "Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.",
      "Your affectionate brother,\n Robert Walton\n\n\n\n\nLetter 3\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nJuly 7th, 17 .",
      "My dear Sister,\n\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe and well advanced\non my voyage.",
      "This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years.",
      "I am, however, in good\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.",
      "We\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\nexpected.",
      "No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\nletter.",
      "One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.",
      "Adieu, my dear Margaret.",
      "Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger.",
      "I will be cool,\npersevering, and prudent.",
      "But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.",
      "Wherefore not?",
      "Thus far I\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.",
      "Why not\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?",
      "What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?",
      "My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.",
      "But I must\nfinish.",
      "Heaven bless my beloved sister!",
      "R.W.",
      "Letter 4\n\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nAugust 5th, 17 .",
      "So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\nthese papers can come into your possession.",
      "Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\nshe floated.",
      "Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog.",
      "We accordingly lay to,\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",
      "About two o clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\nhave no end.",
      "Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\nsituation.",
      "We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs.",
      "We watched the rapid progress\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\ndistant inequalities of the ice.",
      "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.",
      "We were, as we believed,\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.",
      "Shut in, however, by\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\ngreatest attention.",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship.",
      "We, however, lay to until the\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice.",
      "I profited of this time to\nrest for a few hours.",
      "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\ntalking to someone in the sea.",
      "It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\nfragment of ice.",
      "Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\nsome undiscovered island, but a European.",
      "When I appeared on deck the\nmaster said,  Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.",
      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\nforeign accent.",
      "Before I come on board your vessel,  said he,\n will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.",
      "I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.",
      "Good God!",
      "Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless.",
      "His limbs were\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\nsuffering.",
      "I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.",
      "We attempted\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\nair he fainted.",
      "We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\nswallow a small quantity.",
      "As soon as he showed signs of life we\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\nkitchen stove.",
      "By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\nwhich restored him wonderfully.",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.",
      "When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit.",
      "I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.",
      "But he\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",
      "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\nin so strange a vehicle.",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\nhe replied,  To seek one who fled from me.",
      "And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?",
      "Yes.",
      "Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.",
      "This aroused the stranger s attention, and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the d mon, as he called him, had\npursued.",
      "Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said,  I have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.",
      "Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.",
      "And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\nbenevolently restored me to life.",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\nice had destroyed the other sledge.",
      "I replied that I could not answer\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\nstranger.",
      "He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.",
      "I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.",
      "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day.",
      "The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.",
      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\nwith him.",
      "For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",
      "He must\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\nso attractive and amiable.",
      "I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\nof my heart.",
      "I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.",
      "August 13th, 17 .",
      "My affection for my guest increases every day.",
      "He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.",
      "How can I see so\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\ngrief?",
      "He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",
      "He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",
      "Yet, although\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others.",
      "He has frequently\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\ndisguise.",
      "He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\nto secure it.",
      "I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\nenterprise.",
      "One man s life or death were but a small price to pay for\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.",
      "As I spoke, a\ndark gloom spread over my listener s countenance.",
      "At first I\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.",
      "I\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents:  Unhappy man!",
      "Do you\nshare my madness?",
      "Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?",
      "Hear me;\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!",
      "Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\nnecessary to restore his composure.",
      "Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.",
      "He asked\nme the history of my earlier years.",
      "The tale was quickly told, but it\nawakened various trains of reflection.",
      "I spoke of my desire of finding a\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",
      "I agree with you,  replied the stranger;  we are\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\nourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",
      "I once had a friend, the most\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\nfriendship.",
      "You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\ndespair.",
      "But I I have lost everything and cannot begin life\nanew.",
      "As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\ngrief that touched me to the heart.",
      "But he was silent and presently\nretired to his cabin.",
      "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\ndoes the beauties of nature.",
      "The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth.",
      "Such a man has a double existence: he\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",
      "Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer?",
      "You would not if you saw him.",
      "You have been tutored and\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.",
      "Sometimes I\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.",
      "I\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",
      "August 19th, 17 .",
      "Yesterday the stranger said to me,  You may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",
      "I had\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination.",
      "You seek for\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\nhas been.",
      "I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\nin case of failure.",
      "Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\ndeemed marvellous.",
      "Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.",
      "You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes.",
      "I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.",
      "I expressed\nthese feelings in my answer.",
      "I thank you,  he replied,  for your sympathy, but it is\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.",
      "I wait but for one event, and then I\nshall repose in peace.",
      "I understand your feeling,  continued he,\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him;  but you are mistaken, my\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\ndetermined.",
      "He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\nshould be at leisure.",
      "This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.",
      "I have\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\nthe day.",
      "If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.",
      "This\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips with what interest and\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day!",
      "Even now, as I commence my\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\nwithin.",
      "Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus!",
      "Chapter 1\n\n\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\ndistinguished of that republic.",
      "My ancestors had been for many years\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\nsituations with honour and reputation.",
      "He was respected by all who\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\nbusiness.",
      "He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\nhusband and the father of a family.",
      "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them.",
      "One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty.",
      "This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence.",
      "Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\nwretchedness.",
      "My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.",
      "He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\nso little worthy of the affection that united them.",
      "He lost no time in\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.",
      "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode.",
      "Overjoyed at this discovery,\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\nReuss.",
      "But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.",
      "Beaufort\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\nmerchant s house.",
      "The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",
      "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\nthere was no other prospect of support.",
      "But Caroline Beaufort\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\nher in her adversity.",
      "She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\nsupport life.",
      "Several months passed in this manner.",
      "Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar.",
      "This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\nby Beaufort s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber.",
      "He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation.",
      "Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.",
      "There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection.",
      "There was a sense of justice in my father s upright mind\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly.",
      "Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth.",
      "There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her.",
      "Everything was made to yield to her wishes\nand her convenience.",
      "He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\nbenevolent mind.",
      "Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.",
      "During\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.",
      "From Italy they visited Germany and France.",
      "I, their eldest child, was born\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.",
      "I remained\nfor several years their only child.",
      "Much as they were attached to each\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\nmine of love to bestow them upon me.",
      "My mother s tender caresses and\nmy father s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\nfirst recollections.",
      "I was their plaything and their idol, and something\nbetter their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\ntheir duties towards me.",
      "With this deep consciousness of what they owed\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\none train of enjoyment to me.",
      "For a long time I was their only care.",
      "My mother had much desired to have a\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring.",
      "When I was about five\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.",
      "Their benevolent\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.",
      "This, to my\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\npassion remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\nrelieved for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\nafflicted.",
      "During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\nshape.",
      "One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\naccompanied by me, visited this abode.",
      "She found a peasant and his wife,\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\nfive hungry babes.",
      "Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\nabove all the rest.",
      "She appeared of a different stock.",
      "The four others were\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.",
      "Her\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.",
      "Her brow was\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.",
      "She was\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.",
      "Her mother was a\nGerman and had died on giving her birth.",
      "The infant had been placed with\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then.",
      "They had not been\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born.",
      "The father of their\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\nof Italy one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country.",
      "He became the victim of its\nweakness.",
      "Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\nwas not known.",
      "His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\na beggar.",
      "She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",
      "When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\nthan the chamois of the hills.",
      "The apparition was soon explained.",
      "With his\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\ncharge to her.",
      "They were fond of the sweet orphan.",
      "Her presence had seemed\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.",
      "They\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\nbecame the inmate of my parents  house my more than\nsister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\nmy pleasures.",
      "Everyone loved Elizabeth.",
      "The passionate and almost reverential\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\npride and my delight.",
      "On the evening previous to her being brought to\nmy home, my mother had said playfully,  I have a pretty present for my\nVictor tomorrow he shall have it.",
      "And when, on the morrow, she\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\nas mine mine to protect, love, and cherish.",
      "All praises bestowed on\nher I received as made to a possession of my own.",
      "We called each other\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin.",
      "No word, no expression could body\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.",
      "Chapter 2\n\n\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\nour ages.",
      "I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute.",
      "Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together.",
      "Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.",
      "She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\nhome  the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summers she found ample scope for admiration and delight.",
      "While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses.",
      "The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.",
      "Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.",
      "On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry.",
      "We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city.",
      "We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.",
      "It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.",
      "I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.",
      "Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.",
      "He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy.",
      "He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake.",
      "He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.",
      "He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure.",
      "He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.",
      "No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.",
      "My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.",
      "We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed.",
      "When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.",
      "My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately.",
      "I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me.",
      "It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",
      "Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things.",
      "The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.",
      "The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.",
      "Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.",
      "She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",
      "And\nClerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?",
      "Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.",
      "I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",
      "Besides,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",
      "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science.",
      "When I was thirteen years of age we all went\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.",
      "In this house I\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.",
      "I opened it\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.",
      "A new\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\ndiscovery to my father.",
      "My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\nbook and said,  Ah!",
      "Cornelius Agrippa!",
      "My dear Victor, do not waste\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.",
      "If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\nformer studies.",
      "It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.",
      "But the cursory glance\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\navidity.",
      "When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",
      "I read and\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\ntreasures known to few besides myself.",
      "I have described myself as always\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\nnature.",
      "In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.",
      "Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.",
      "Those of his\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\nappeared even to my boy s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\npursuit.",
      "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\nwith their practical uses.",
      "The most learned philosopher knew little\nmore.",
      "He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.",
      "He might dissect,\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.",
      "I\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\nignorantly I had repined.",
      "But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\nmore.",
      "I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\ndisciple.",
      "It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\nstudies.",
      "My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\nchild s blindness, added to a student s thirst for knowledge.",
      "Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher s stone and the elixir\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.",
      "Wealth was an\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\na violent death!",
      "Nor were these my only visions.",
      "The raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",
      "And thus for a time I was\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",
      "When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.",
      "It\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",
      "I remained,\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.",
      "As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\nremained but a blasted stump.",
      "When we visited it the next morning, we found\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner.",
      "It was not splintered by the\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.",
      "I never beheld\nanything so utterly destroyed.",
      "Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\nelectricity.",
      "On this occasion a man of great research in natural\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.",
      "All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\naccustomed studies.",
      "It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\nbe known.",
      "All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\ndespicable.",
      "By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\nreal knowledge.",
      "In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",
      "Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin.",
      "When I look back, it seems to me\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.",
      "Her victory was\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\nstudies.",
      "It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",
      "It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.",
      "Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\nterrible destruction.",
      "Chapter 3\n\n\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.",
      "I had\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country.",
      "My\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\noccurred an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",
      "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\nin the greatest danger.",
      "During her illness many arguments had been urged to\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.",
      "She had at first\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",
      "She\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\nof the distemper Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver.",
      "On the third day my mother\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.",
      "On her\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\nher.",
      "She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.",
      "My\nchildren,  she said,  my firmest hopes of future happiness were\nplaced on the prospect of your union.",
      "This expectation will now be the\nconsolation of your father.",
      "Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\nmy younger children.",
      "Alas!",
      "I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?",
      "But these are\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.",
      "She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",
      "I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",
      "It is so\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\nfor ever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard.",
      "These are the reflections of\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.",
      "Yet from whom has\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection?",
      "And why should I\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",
      "The time at\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\nsacrilege, is not banished.",
      "My mother was dead, but we had still\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\nspoiler has not seized.",
      "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\nwas now again determined upon.",
      "I obtained from my father a respite of\nsome weeks.",
      "It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\nlife.",
      "I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.",
      "I was\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",
      "She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.",
      "She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\nzeal.",
      "She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\nher uncle and cousins.",
      "Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.",
      "She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.",
      "The day of my departure at length arrived.",
      "Clerval spent the last\nevening with us.",
      "He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.",
      "His\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\naspirations and ambition of his son.",
      "Henry deeply felt the misfortune\nof being debarred from a liberal education.",
      "He said little, but when\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\nof commerce.",
      "We sat late.",
      "We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\npersuade ourselves to say the word  Farewell!",
      "It was said, and we\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\nother was deceived; but when at morning s dawn I descended to the\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there my father\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",
      "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\nthe most melancholy reflections.",
      "I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\npleasure I was now alone.",
      "In the university whither I was going I\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector.",
      "My life had hitherto\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\nrepugnance to new countenances.",
      "I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\nClerval; these were  old familiar faces,  but I believed myself\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers.",
      "Such were my reflections as\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.",
      "I\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.",
      "I had often, when at home,\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.",
      "Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\nrepent.",
      "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",
      "At length the\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes.",
      "I alighted and was\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.",
      "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\nsome of the principal professors.",
      "Chance or rather the evil\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father s\ndoor led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.",
      "He\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.",
      "He\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy.",
      "I replied carelessly, and\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\nauthors I had studied.",
      "The professor stared.",
      "Have you,  he\nsaid,  really spent your time in studying such nonsense?",
      "I replied in the affirmative.",
      "Every minute,  continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth,  every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost.",
      "You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\nand useless names.",
      "Good God!",
      "In what desert land have you lived,\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\nare ancient?",
      "I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",
      "My dear\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\nomitted.",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\nshape.",
      "M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his pursuits.",
      "In rather a too philosophical and connected a\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\nto concerning them in my early years.",
      "As a child I had not been\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\nscience.",
      "With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\nthe scene was changed.",
      "The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\nscience was chiefly founded.",
      "I was required to exchange chimeras of\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\nabode.",
      "But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",
      "And although I\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",
      "This professor was very\nunlike his colleague.",
      "He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.",
      "His person\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.",
      "He then took\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\nits elementary terms.",
      "After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\nshall never forget:\n\n The ancient teachers of this science,  said he,\n promised impossibilities and performed nothing.",
      "The modern masters\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles.",
      "They penetrate into the recesses\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.",
      "They ascend into the\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\nthe air we breathe.",
      "They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.",
      "Such were the professor s words rather let me say such the words of\nthe fate enounced to destroy me.",
      "As he went on I felt as if my soul\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\none purpose.",
      "So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\nFrankenstein more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",
      "I closed not my eyes that night.",
      "My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\nhad no power to produce it.",
      "By degrees, after the morning s dawn,\nsleep came.",
      "I awoke, and my yesternight s thoughts were as a dream.",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\nnatural talent.",
      "On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.",
      "His\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.",
      "I\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\ngiven to his fellow professor.",
      "He heard with attention the little\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\nexhibited.",
      "He said that  These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge.",
      "They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",
      "The\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.",
      "I\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\nlabours.",
      "I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\nprocure.",
      "I am happy,  said M. Waldman,  to have gained a\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\nyour success.",
      "Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\nneglected the other branches of science.",
      "A man would make but a very sorry\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.",
      "If your\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\nphilosophy, including mathematics.",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\nthe science not to derange their mechanism.",
      "He also gave me the list of\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.",
      "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.",
      "Chapter 4\n\n\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",
      "I attended the\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",
      "In\nM. Waldman I found a true friend.",
      "His gentleness was never tinged by\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry.",
      "In a thousand ways\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.",
      "My application was at\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\nwas rapid.",
      "My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\nmy proficiency that of the masters.",
      "Professor Krempe often asked me,\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.",
      "Two years\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\nhoped to make.",
      "None but those who have experienced them can conceive\nof the enticements of science.",
      "In other studies you go as far as\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\nuniversity.",
      "When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\nhappened that protracted my stay.",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\nlife.",
      "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",
      "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\ninquiries.",
      "I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology.",
      "Unless I had been\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable.",
      "To examine the\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death.",
      "I became\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.",
      "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.",
      "I do not ever\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\nthe apparition of a spirit.",
      "Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\nfood for the worm.",
      "Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\ncharnel-houses.",
      "My attention was fixed upon every object the most\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.",
      "I saw how the\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain.",
      "I paused, examining and\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me a light so brilliant and\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\nsecret.",
      "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",
      "The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\ntrue.",
      "Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable.",
      "After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.",
      "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture.",
      "After so much time spent in\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils.",
      "But this discovery was so\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",
      "What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\nof the world was now within my grasp.",
      "Not that, like a magic scene, it\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\naccomplished.",
      "I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.",
      "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\nsubject.",
      "I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\nto your destruction and infallible misery.",
      "Learn from me, if not by my\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\nwill allow.",
      "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",
      "Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\ndifficulty and labour.",
      "I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\nas man.",
      "The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\nultimately succeed.",
      "I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.",
      "Nor\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\nargument of its impracticability.",
      "It was with these feelings that I\nbegan the creation of a human being.",
      "As the minuteness of the parts\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large.",
      "After having\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",
      "Life and death\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\npour a torrent of light into our dark world.",
      "A new species would bless\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\nowe their being to me.",
      "No father could claim the gratitude of his\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs.",
      "Pursuing these\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\nwith unremitting ardour.",
      "My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\nperson had become emaciated with confinement.",
      "Sometimes, on the very\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\nnext day or the next hour might realise.",
      "One secret which I alone\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.",
      "Who shall conceive\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\nclay?",
      "My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.",
      "It was\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\nreturned to my old habits.",
      "I collected bones from charnel-houses and\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\nframe.",
      "In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment.",
      "The\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.",
      "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit.",
      "It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",
      "And the\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\nnot seen for so long a time.",
      "I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\nwell remembered the words of my father:  I know that while you are\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\nhear regularly from you.",
      "You must pardon me if I regard any\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\nare equally neglected.",
      "I knew well therefore what would be my father s feelings, but I could\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",
      "I wished, as it\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\nshould be completed.",
      "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\nblame.",
      "A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\ndisturb his tranquillity.",
      "I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\nis an exception to this rule.",
      "If the study to which you apply yourself\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\nmind.",
      "If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, C sar would have spared his\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",
      "But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",
      "My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.",
      "Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always\nyielded me supreme delight so deeply was I engrossed in my\noccupation.",
      "The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\nsucceeded.",
      "But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",
      "Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.",
      "Sometimes I grew alarmed at\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.",
      "Chapter 5\n\n\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils.",
      "With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",
      "It was\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",
      "How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\nform?",
      "His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful.",
      "Beautiful!",
      "Great God!",
      "His yellow skin scarcely covered\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",
      "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\nof human nature.",
      "I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",
      "For this I had\ndeprived myself of rest and health.",
      "I had desired it with an ardour\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\nheart.",
      "Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.",
      "At length lassitude\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",
      "But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\ndreams.",
      "I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\nthe streets of Ingolstadt.",
      "Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",
      "I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\nshutters, I beheld the wretch the miserable monster whom I had\ncreated.",
      "He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\nmay be called, were fixed on me.",
      "His jaws opened, and he muttered some\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",
      "He might have\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.",
      "I took refuge in the\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\nhad so miserably given life.",
      "Oh!",
      "No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.",
      "A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.",
      "I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.",
      "I passed the night wretchedly.",
      "Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",
      "Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",
      "Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",
      "The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview.",
      "I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.",
      "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",
      "I\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\nwhat I was doing.",
      "My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\n \n Like one who, on a lonely road,\n Doth walk in fear and dread,\n And, having once turned round, walks on,\n And turns no more his head;\n Because he knows a frightful fiend\n Doth close behind him tread.",
      "[Coleridge s  Ancient Mariner. ]",
      "Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped.",
      "Here I paused, I knew not why;\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\ntowards me from the other end of the street.",
      "As it drew nearer I observed\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\ninstantly sprung out.",
      "My dear Frankenstein,  exclaimed he,\n how glad I am to see you!",
      "How fortunate that you should be here at\nthe very moment of my alighting!",
      "Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\nto my recollection.",
      "I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\ncalm and serene joy.",
      "I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\nmanner, and we walked towards my college.",
      "Clerval continued talking for\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt.",
      "You may easily believe,  said\nhe,  how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield:  I have ten thousand florins\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.",
      "But his\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\nknowledge.",
      "It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.",
      "Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\nyou so seldom.",
      "By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\naccount myself.",
      "But, my dear Frankenstein,  continued he, stopping\nshort and gazing full in my face,  I did not before remark how very ill\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\nseveral nights.",
      "You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\nend and that I am at length free.",
      "I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.",
      "I walked with a\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.",
      "I then reflected, and\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about.",
      "I dreaded to\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",
      "Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room.",
      "My hand was already on the\nlock of the door before I recollected myself.",
      "I then paused, and a\ncold shivering came over me.",
      "I threw the door forcibly open, as\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.",
      "I stepped\nfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\nfrom its hideous guest.",
      "I could hardly believe that so great a good\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",
      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\nbut I was unable to contain myself.",
      "It was not joy only that possessed\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\nbeat rapidly.",
      "I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",
      "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.",
      "My dear Victor,  cried he,  what, for God s sake,\nis the matter?",
      "Do not laugh in that manner.",
      "How ill you are!",
      "What is the\ncause of all this?",
      "Do not ask me,  cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room;  _he_ can\ntell.",
      "Oh, save me!",
      "Save me!",
      "I imagined that the monster seized me;\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.",
      "Poor Clerval!",
      "What must have been his feelings?",
      "A meeting, which he\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",
      "But I\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.",
      "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\nseveral months.",
      "During all that time Henry was my only nurse.",
      "I\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father s advanced age and unfitness\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\ndisorder.",
      "He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\naction that he could towards them.",
      "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",
      "Doubtless my\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\ngrieved my friend, I recovered.",
      "I remember the first time I became\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",
      "It was\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\nconvalescence.",
      "I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",
      "Dearest Clerval,  exclaimed I,  how kind, how very good\nyou are to me.",
      "This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",
      "How shall I ever\nrepay you?",
      "I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.",
      "You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?",
      "I trembled.",
      "One subject!",
      "What could it be?",
      "Could he allude to an object on\nwhom I dared not even think?",
      "Compose yourself,  said Clerval, who observed my change of\ncolour,  I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\nown handwriting.",
      "They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\nyour long silence.",
      "Is that all, my dear Henry?",
      "How could you suppose that my first\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\nwho are so deserving of my love?",
      "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\nyour cousin, I believe.",
      "Chapter 6\n\n\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands.",
      "It was from my\nown Elizabeth:\n\n My dearest Cousin,\n\n You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.",
      "You are\nforbidden to write to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions.",
      "For a long time I have thought\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",
      "I have\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\nperform it myself!",
      "I figure to myself that the task of attending on\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\nyour poor cousin.",
      "Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\nyou are getting better.",
      "I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.",
      "Get well and return to us.",
      "You will find a happy, cheerful home and\nfriends who love you dearly.",
      "Your father s health is vigorous, and he\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",
      "How pleased you would\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest!",
      "He is now sixteen and full\nof activity and spirit.",
      "He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\nelder brother returns to us.",
      "My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\npowers of application.",
      "He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\nlake.",
      "I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.",
      "Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\nplace since you left us.",
      "The blue lake and snow-clad mountains they\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\nregulated by the same immutable laws.",
      "My trifling occupations take up\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\nnone but happy, kind faces around me.",
      "Since you left us, but one\nchange has taken place in our little household.",
      "Do you remember on\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?",
      "Probably you do not;\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words.",
      "Madame Moritz,\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\nthird.",
      "This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\nto allow her to live at our house.",
      "The republican institutions of our\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it.",
      "Hence there is less\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\nmore refined and moral.",
      "A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\nthing as a servant in France and England.",
      "Justine, thus received in\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",
      "Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she looked so\nfrank-hearted and happy.",
      "My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\nwhich she had at first intended.",
      "This benefit was fully repaid;\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.",
      "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",
      "She\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",
      "When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\nwith the most anxious affection.",
      "Poor Justine was very ill; but other\ntrials were reserved for her.",
      "One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",
      "The\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\npartiality.",
      "She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived.",
      "Accordingly, a few months\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\nrepentant mother.",
      "Poor girl!",
      "She wept when she quitted our house; she\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\nfor vivacity.",
      "Nor was her residence at her mother s house of a nature\nto restore her gaiety.",
      "The poor woman was very vacillating in her\nrepentance.",
      "She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\nbrothers and sister.",
      "Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\nnow at peace for ever.",
      "She died on the first approach of cold weather,\nat the beginning of this last winter.",
      "Justine has just returned to us;\nand I assure you I love her tenderly.",
      "She is very clever and gentle,\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",
      "I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\nWilliam.",
      "I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.",
      "When he\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\nhealth.",
      "He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",
      "Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva.",
      "The pretty Miss Mansfield\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",
      "Her ugly\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.",
      "Your\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva.",
      "But he has already\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",
      "She is a widow, and much\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\neverybody.",
      "I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\nreturns upon me as I conclude.",
      "Write, dearest Victor, one line one\nword will be a blessing to us.",
      "Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\ngrateful.",
      "Adieu!",
      "my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\nyou, write!",
      "Elizabeth Lavenza.",
      "Geneva, March 18th, 17 .",
      "Dear, dear Elizabeth!",
      "I exclaimed, when I had read her\nletter:  I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\nthey must feel.",
      "I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.",
      "In another\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.",
      "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\nseveral professors of the university.",
      "In doing this, I underwent a\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\nsustained.",
      "Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\nto the name of natural philosophy.",
      "When I was otherwise quite restored\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\nof my nervous symptoms.",
      "Henry saw this, and had removed all my\napparatus from my view.",
      "He had also changed my apartment; for he\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\npreviously been my laboratory.",
      "But these cares of Clerval were made of\nno avail when I visited the professors.",
      "M. Waldman inflicted torture\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\nhad made in the sciences.",
      "He soon perceived that I disliked the\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.",
      "What\ncould I do?",
      "He meant to please, and he tormented me.",
      "I felt as if he\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.",
      "I\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",
      "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",
      "I\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",
      "I saw plainly\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",
      "M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",
      "D n\nthe fellow!",
      "cried he;  why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\noutstript us all.",
      "Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",
      "A\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.",
      "Ay,\nay,  continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\n M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.",
      "Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.",
      "M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",
      "Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.",
      "He\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself.",
      "Resolved to pursue no\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\nscope for his spirit of enterprise.",
      "The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\nthe same studies.",
      "Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",
      "I\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\namusement.",
      "I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\nrepaid my labours.",
      "Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\nany other country.",
      "When you read their writings, life appears to\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.",
      "How\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!",
      "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",
      "I felt this\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\nfriends.",
      "My return had only been delayed so long, from an\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants.",
      "The winter, however, was spent\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",
      "The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",
      "I acceded\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",
      "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend.",
      "Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",
      "Excellent friend!",
      "how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.",
      "A selfish\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",
      "When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\ndelightful sensations.",
      "A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\necstasy.",
      "The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.",
      "I\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\ninvincible burden.",
      "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\nhis soul.",
      "The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\nfancy and passion.",
      "At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",
      "We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",
      "My own spirits were\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.",
      "Chapter 7\n\n\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father: \n\n My dear Victor,\n\n You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",
      "But\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",
      "What would be\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",
      "And how, Victor, can\nI relate our misfortune?",
      "Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\nson?",
      "I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.",
      "William is dead!",
      "that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!",
      "Victor, he is murdered!",
      "I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.",
      "Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais.",
      "The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual.",
      "It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found.",
      "We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return.",
      "Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",
      "This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\nreturned to the house.",
      "He was not there.",
      "We returned again, with\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.",
      "About five in the morning I\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\nprint of the murder s finger was on his neck.",
      "He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.",
      "She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse.",
      "At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed,  O God!",
      "I have murdered my\ndarling child!",
      "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.",
      "When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh.",
      "She told me, that that same\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\nminiature that she possessed of your mother.",
      "This picture is gone, and\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.",
      "We\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!",
      "Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.",
      "She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\nher words pierce my heart.",
      "We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?",
      "Your dear mother!",
      "Alas, Victor!",
      "I now say, Thank God she did not live\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",
      "Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds.",
      "Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.",
      "Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n\n Alphonse Frankenstein.",
      "Geneva, May 12th, 17 .",
      "Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving new from my friends.",
      "I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.",
      "My dear Frankenstein,  exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\nweep with bitterness,  are you always to be unhappy?",
      "My dear friend,\nwhat has happened?",
      "I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation.",
      "Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.",
      "I can offer you no consolation, my friend,  said he;\n your disaster is irreparable.",
      "What do you intend to do?",
      "To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.",
      "During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy.",
      "Poor William!",
      "said he,\n dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!",
      "Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss!",
      "To die so miserably; to feel the murderer s grasp!",
      "How\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!",
      "Poor little\nfellow!",
      "one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\nhe is at rest.",
      "The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.",
      "A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.",
      "He can no longer\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.",
      "Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude.",
      "But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.",
      "My journey was very melancholy.",
      "At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress.",
      "I could hardly sustain\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.",
      "I passed through\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.",
      "How altered every thing might be during that time!",
      "One sudden and\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.",
      "Fear overcame me; I\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\nalthough I was unable to define them.",
      "I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",
      "I\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\nsnowy mountains,  the palaces of nature,  were not changed.",
      "By\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\ntowards Geneva.",
      "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\napproached my native town.",
      "I discovered more distinctly the black\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.",
      "I wept like a\nchild.",
      "Dear mountains!",
      "my own beautiful lake!",
      "how do you welcome your\nwanderer?",
      "Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\nplacid.",
      "Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?",
      "I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure.",
      "My country, my beloved\ncountry!",
      "who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\nlake!",
      "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.",
      "Night also\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\nmore gloomily.",
      "The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\nbeings.",
      "Alas!",
      "I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.",
      "The sky\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\nwhere my poor William had been murdered.",
      "As I could not pass through the\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.",
      "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures.",
      "The storm appeared to approach\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\nprogress.",
      "It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\nover my head.",
      "It was echoed from Sal ve, the Juras, and the Alps of\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\nfrom the preceding flash.",
      "The storm, as is often the case in\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",
      "The\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\nCop t. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the M le, a peaked mountain to the\neast of the lake.",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\na hasty step.",
      "This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\nhands, and exclaimed aloud,  William, dear angel!",
      "this is thy\nfuneral, this thy dirge!",
      "As I said these words, I perceived in the\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",
      "A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\nd mon, to whom I had given life.",
      "What did he there?",
      "Could he be (I\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?",
      "No sooner did that\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",
      "The figure\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",
      "Nothing in human shape could\nhave destroyed the fair child.",
      "_He_ was the murderer!",
      "I could not\ndoubt it.",
      "The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\nfact.",
      "I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Sal ve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\nsouth.",
      "He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",
      "I remained motionless.",
      "The thunder ceased; but the rain still\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",
      "I\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.",
      "Two years had\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\nwas this his first crime?",
      "Alas!",
      "I had turned loose into the world a\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\nmurdered my brother?",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",
      "But I did not\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\nscenes of evil and despair.",
      "I considered the being whom I had cast\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\nto destroy all that was dear to me.",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.",
      "The gates were\nopen, and I hastened to my father s house.",
      "My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade.",
      "But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.",
      "A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",
      "I\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.",
      "I well knew that\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity.",
      "Besides, the strange nature\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it.",
      "And then of what use would\nbe pursuit?",
      "Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\noverhanging sides of Mont Sal ve?",
      "These reflections determined me, and\nI resolved to remain silent.",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father s house.",
      "I\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\nto attend their usual hour of rising.",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\ndeparture for Ingolstadt.",
      "Beloved and venerable parent!",
      "He still remained\nto me.",
      "I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\nmantel-piece.",
      "It was an historical subject, painted at my father s\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\nby the coffin of her dead father.",
      "Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\nsentiment of pity.",
      "Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\ntears flowed when I looked upon it.",
      "While I was thus engaged, Ernest\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n Welcome, my dearest Victor,  said he.",
      "Ah!",
      "I wish you\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\ndelighted.",
      "You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.",
      "Poor\nWilliam!",
      "he was our darling and our pride!",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother s eyes; a sense of mortal\nagony crept over my frame.",
      "Before, I had only imagined the\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\na not less terrible, disaster.",
      "I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",
      "She most of all,  said Ernest,  requires consolation; she accused\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\nvery wretched.",
      "But since the murderer has been discovered \n\n The murderer discovered!",
      "Good God!",
      "how can that be?",
      "who could attempt\nto pursue him?",
      "It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.",
      "I saw him too; he\nwas free last night!",
      "I do not know what you mean,  replied my brother, in accents of\nwonder,  but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",
      "No\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",
      "Indeed, who would credit\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?",
      "Justine Moritz!",
      "Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?",
      "But it is\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?",
      "No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\nleaves no hope for doubt.",
      "But she will be tried today, and you will\nthen hear all.",
      "He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\nbed for several days.",
      "During this interval, one of the servants,\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.",
      "The servant\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\nJustine was apprehended.",
      "On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\nmanner.",
      "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\nearnestly,  You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",
      "Justine, poor,\ngood Justine, is innocent.",
      "At that instant my father entered.",
      "I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n Good God, papa!",
      "Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\npoor William.",
      "We do also, unfortunately,  replied my father,  for indeed I had\nrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.",
      "My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.",
      "If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",
      "She is to be\ntried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.",
      "This speech calmed me.",
      "I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",
      "I\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her.",
      "My tale was not one to\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\nmadness by the vulgar.",
      "Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?",
      "We were soon joined by Elizabeth.",
      "Time had altered her since I last\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\nher childish years.",
      "There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.",
      "She welcomed me with the greatest affection.",
      "Your arrival, my dear\ncousin,  said she,  fills me with hope.",
      "You perhaps will find some\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine.",
      "Alas!",
      "who is safe, if she\nbe convicted of crime?",
      "I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\nupon my own.",
      "Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.",
      "If she is condemned, I\nnever shall know joy more.",
      "But she will not, I am sure she will not;\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\nWilliam.",
      "She is innocent, my Elizabeth,  said I,  and that shall\nbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\nof her acquittal.",
      "How kind and generous you are!",
      "every one else believes in her guilt,\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\nsee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\nhopeless and despairing.",
      "She wept.",
      "Dearest niece,  said my father,  dry your tears.",
      "If she\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\npartiality.",
      "Chapter 8\n\n\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o clock, when the trial was to\ncommence.",
      "My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.",
      "During the whole of\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.",
      "It was to\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",
      "Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave, and I the cause!",
      "A thousand times rather would I\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\nexculpated her who suffered through me.",
      "The appearance of Justine was calm.",
      "She was dressed in mourning, and\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.",
      "Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",
      "She\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.",
      "When she entered the\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\nseated.",
      "A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\nher utter guiltlessness.",
      "The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called.",
      "Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had.",
      "She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found.",
      "The woman asked her what she\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer.",
      "She returned to the house about eight\no clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\nif anything had been heard concerning him.",
      "When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.",
      "The\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",
      "Justine was called on for her defence.",
      "As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered.",
      "Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\nexpressed.",
      "Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\nalthough variable voice.",
      "God knows,  she said,  how entirely I am innocent.",
      "But I\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\ndoubtful or suspicious.",
      "She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Ch ne, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva.",
      "On her return, at about nine o clock, she met a man who asked\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.",
      "She was\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",
      "Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.",
      "It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\nto find my brother.",
      "If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\nit was without her knowledge.",
      "That she had been bewildered when\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",
      "Concerning the picture she could give no account.",
      "I know,  continued the unhappy victim,  how heavily and\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket.",
      "But here also I am checked.",
      "I believe that I have no\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\nwantonly.",
      "Did the murderer place it there?",
      "I know of no opportunity\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\njewel, to part with it again so soon?",
      "I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope.",
      "I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.",
      "Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\nforward.",
      "Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\nthe court.",
      "I am,  said she,  the cousin of the unhappy child who\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth.",
      "It may\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\nknow of her character.",
      "I am well acquainted with the accused.",
      "I have lived\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\ntwo years.",
      "During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\nbenevolent of human creatures.",
      "She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\nuncle s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",
      "She was\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\nmost affectionate mother.",
      "For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\non her perfect innocence.",
      "She had no temptation for such an action; as to\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\nher.",
      "A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth s simple and powerful\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.",
      "She\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",
      "My own\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.",
      "I believed\nin her innocence; I knew it.",
      "Could the d mon who had (I did not for a\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?",
      "I could not sustain the\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\nI rushed out of the court in agony.",
      "The tortures of the accused did\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",
      "I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.",
      "In the morning I went to\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched.",
      "I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit.",
      "The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\nwas condemned.",
      "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.",
      "I had before\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured.",
      "The person to whom I\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.",
      "That evidence,  he observed,  was hardly required in so glaring a\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\ndecisive.",
      "This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?",
      "Had\nmy eyes deceived me?",
      "And was I really as mad as the whole world would\nbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?",
      "I\nhastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",
      "My cousin,  replied I,  it is decided as you may have expected; all\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\nshould escape.",
      "But she has confessed.",
      "This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\nJustine s innocence.",
      "Alas!",
      "said she.",
      "How shall I\never again believe in human goodness?",
      "Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",
      "Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\ncommitted a murder.",
      "Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\ncousin.",
      "My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\njudgment and feelings to decide.",
      "Yes,  said Elizabeth,\n I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\nme; I cannot go alone.",
      "The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\nI could not refuse.",
      "We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\nher knees.",
      "She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",
      "My\ncousin wept also.",
      "Oh, Justine!",
      "said she.",
      "Why did you rob me of my last consolation?",
      "I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\nwas not so miserable as I am now.",
      "And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",
      "Do you also\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?",
      "Her\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.",
      "Rise, my poor girl,  said Elizabeth;  why do you kneel,\nif you are innocent?",
      "I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\nyourself declared your guilt.",
      "That report, you say, is false; and be\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\nmoment, but your own confession.",
      "I did confess, but I confessed a lie.",
      "I confessed, that I might\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\nall my other sins.",
      "The God of heaven forgive me!",
      "Ever since I was\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\nwas.",
      "He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\nI continued obdurate.",
      "Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",
      "What could I do?",
      "In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\nmiserable.",
      "She paused, weeping, and then continued,  I thought with horror, my\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",
      "Dear William!",
      "dearest blessed child!",
      "I soon shall see you again in\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\nam to suffer ignominy and death.",
      "Oh, Justine!",
      "Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.",
      "Why did you confess?",
      "But do not mourn, dear girl.",
      "Do not fear.",
      "I\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence.",
      "I will melt the stony\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.",
      "You shall not die!",
      "You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!",
      "No!",
      "No!",
      "I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.",
      "Justine shook her head mournfully.",
      "I do not fear to die,  she said;\n that pang is past.",
      "God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\nendure the worst.",
      "I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\nfate awaiting me.",
      "Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\nthe will of heaven!",
      "During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",
      "Despair!",
      "Who dared talk of that?",
      "The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\ndeep and bitter agony.",
      "I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.",
      "Justine started.",
      "When\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said,  Dear sir, you are very\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?",
      "I could not answer.",
      "No, Justine,  said Elizabeth;  he is more\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.",
      "I truly thank him.",
      "In these last moments I feel the sincerest\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.",
      "How sweet is\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am!",
      "It removes more than\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.",
      "Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.",
      "She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired.",
      "But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation.",
      "Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",
      "Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme which nothing could extinguish.",
      "We stayed several hours with\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\nherself away.",
      "I wish,  cried she,  that I were to die with you; I\ncannot live in this world of misery.",
      "Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears.",
      "She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion,  Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\nsuffer!",
      "Live, and be happy, and make others so.",
      "And on the morrow Justine died.",
      "Elizabeth s heart-rending eloquence\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer.",
      "My passionate and indignant\nappeals were lost upon them.",
      "And when I received their cold answers\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\navowal died away on my lips.",
      "Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",
      "She\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!",
      "From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth.",
      "This also was my doing!",
      "And my\nfather s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands!",
      "Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\nare not your last tears!",
      "Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",
      "Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\nin serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",
      "Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",
      "Chapter 9\n\n\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear.",
      "Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.",
      "The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart which nothing could remove.",
      "Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\nbehind.",
      "Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.",
      "I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\nbeings.",
      "Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe.",
      "This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.",
      "I shunned\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\nsolitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",
      "My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.",
      "Do you think, Victor,  said he,  that I do not suffer\nalso?",
      "No one could love a child more than I loved your\nbrother tears came into his eyes as he spoke but\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?",
      "It is also a duty\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.",
      "This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\nother sensations.",
      "Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.",
      "About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.",
      "This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me.",
      "The shutting of the gates regularly at\nten o clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\nto me.",
      "I was now free.",
      "Often, after the rest of the family had\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\nwater.",
      "Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",
      "I\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\nheavenly if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore often,\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever.",
      "But I was restrained,\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",
      "I thought also of my\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\namong them?",
      "At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.",
      "But that\ncould not be.",
      "Remorse extinguished every hope.",
      "I had been the author of\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness.",
      "I had an obscure feeling\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.",
      "There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\nbehind.",
      "My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.",
      "When I thought of\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.",
      "When I\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\nof moderation.",
      "I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base.",
      "I wished\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",
      "Our house was the house of mourning.",
      "My father s health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events.",
      "Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\nand destroyed.",
      "She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\nfuture prospects.",
      "The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\nsmiles.",
      "When I reflect, my dear cousin,  said she,  on the miserable death of\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\nappeared to me.",
      "Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other s blood.",
      "Yet I am\ncertainly unjust.",
      "Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures.",
      "For the sake\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\nit had been her own!",
      "I could not consent to the death of any human\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\nremain in the society of men.",
      "But she was innocent.",
      "I know, I feel\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.",
      "Alas!",
      "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\nassure themselves of certain happiness?",
      "I feel as if I were walking on\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",
      "William and Justine were\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\nand perhaps respected.",
      "But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\nwretch.",
      "I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.",
      "I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer.",
      "Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said,  My dearest friend, you\nmust calm yourself.",
      "These events have affected me, God knows how\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.",
      "There is an expression of\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\ntremble.",
      "Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.",
      "Remember the\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.",
      "Have we lost\nthe power of rendering you happy?",
      "Ah!",
      "While we love, while we are\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing what can disturb our\npeace?",
      "And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\nheart?",
      "Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",
      "Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\nineffectual.",
      "I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\ninfluence could penetrate.",
      "The wounded deer dragging its fainting\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",
      "Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\nsensations.",
      "It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows.",
      "My wanderings were directed\ntowards the valley of Chamounix.",
      "I had visited it frequently during my\nboyhood.",
      "Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",
      "I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.",
      "I afterwards\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\ninjury on these rugged roads.",
      "The weather was fine; it was about the\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",
      "The\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\nthe ravine of Arve.",
      "The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\nOmnipotence and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise.",
      "Still, as I ascended higher,\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",
      "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.",
      "But it was\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.",
      "I passed the bridge of P lissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it.",
      "Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.",
      "This\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.",
      "The\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields.",
      "Immense glaciers approached\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\nmarked the smoke of its passage.",
      "Mont Blanc, the supreme and\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\nand its tremendous _d me_ overlooked the valley.",
      "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney.",
      "Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood.",
      "The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.",
      "Then again the\nkindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection.",
      "Then I spurred on my\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\nmyself or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",
      "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.",
      "Exhaustion succeeded\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.",
      "For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.",
      "The same lulling sounds\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\nthe giver of oblivion.",
      "Chapter 10\n\n\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley.",
      "I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley.",
      "The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands.",
      "These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.",
      "They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it.",
      "In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month.",
      "I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day.",
      "They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds they all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.",
      "Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?",
      "All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought.",
      "The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends.",
      "Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats.",
      "What were rain and storm to me?",
      "My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert.",
      "I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.",
      "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.",
      "The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life.",
      "I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.",
      "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain.",
      "It is a scene terrifically desolate.",
      "In a thousand spots\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\nother trees.",
      "The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker.",
      "The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.",
      "I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me.",
      "Alas!",
      "Why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings.",
      "If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.",
      "We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.",
      "We rise; one wand ring thought pollutes the day.",
      "We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\n     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\n     The path of its departure still is free.",
      "Man s yesterday may ne er be like his morrow;\n     Nought may endure but mutability!",
      "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.",
      "For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.",
      "A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains.",
      "Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",
      "The surface is very\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep.",
      "The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",
      "The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.",
      "From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.",
      "I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.",
      "The sea,\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses.",
      "Their icy and glittering\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.",
      "My heart, which was\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\naway from the joys of life.",
      "As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed.",
      "He bounded over the\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.",
      "I was\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.",
      "I\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)",
      "that it was the wretch whom I had created.",
      "I trembled with rage and\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\nmortal combat.",
      "He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.",
      "But I scarcely\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\ndetestation and contempt.",
      "Devil,  I exclaimed,  do you dare approach me?",
      "And do\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?",
      "Begone, vile insect!",
      "Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!",
      "And,\noh!",
      "That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!",
      "I expected this reception,  said the d mon.",
      "All men hate the\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\nliving things!",
      "Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\none of us.",
      "You purpose to kill me.",
      "How dare you sport thus with life?",
      "Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\nmankind.",
      "If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.",
      "Abhorred monster!",
      "Fiend that thou art!",
      "The tortures of hell are too\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes.",
      "Wretched devil!",
      "You reproach me with\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\nso negligently bestowed.",
      "My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",
      "He easily eluded me and said,\n\n Be calm!",
      "I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head.",
      "Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery?",
      "Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.",
      "Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\njoints more supple.",
      "But I will not be tempted to set myself in\nopposition to thee.",
      "I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\nthe which thou owest me.",
      "Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\nclemency and affection, is most due.",
      "Remember that I am thy creature;\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed.",
      "Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\nalone am irrevocably excluded.",
      "I was benevolent and good; misery made\nme a fiend.",
      "Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.",
      "Begone!",
      "I will not hear you.",
      "There can be no community between you\nand me; we are enemies.",
      "Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\nin which one must fall.",
      "How can I move thee?",
      "Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\ncompassion?",
      "Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?",
      "You, my\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\nwho owe me nothing?",
      "They spurn and hate me.",
      "The desert mountains and\ndreary glaciers are my refuge.",
      "I have wandered here many days; the\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\nonly one which man does not grudge.",
      "These bleak skies I hail, for they\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings.",
      "If the multitude of mankind\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\nmy destruction.",
      "Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?",
      "I will keep\nno terms with my enemies.",
      "I am miserable, and they shall share my\nwretchedness.",
      "Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.",
      "Let your compassion be\nmoved, and do not disdain me.",
      "Listen to my tale; when you have heard\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.",
      "But hear me.",
      "The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.",
      "Listen\nto me, Frankenstein.",
      "You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.",
      "Oh, praise the\neternal justice of man!",
      "Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.",
      "Why do you call to my remembrance,  I rejoined,  circumstances of\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\nauthor?",
      "Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\nlight!",
      "Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!",
      "You have made me wretched beyond expression.",
      "You have left me no power\nto consider whether I am just to you or not.",
      "Begone!",
      "Relieve me from\nthe sight of your detested form.",
      "Thus I relieve thee, my creator,  he said, and placed his hated hands\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence;  thus I take from\nthee a sight which you abhor.",
      "Still thou canst listen to me and grant\nme thy compassion.",
      "By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you.",
      "Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain.",
      "The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide.",
      "On you it rests,\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\nyour own speedy ruin.",
      "As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.",
      "My heart\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale.",
      "I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution.",
      "I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.",
      "For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness.",
      "These motives urged me to comply with\nhis demand.",
      "We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\nrock.",
      "The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\nheart and depressed spirits.",
      "But I consented to listen, and seating\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\nhis tale.",
      "Chapter 11\n\n\n It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.",
      "A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.",
      "By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes.",
      "Darkness then came over me and troubled\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again.",
      "I walked and, I believe,\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",
      "Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",
      "The light\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.",
      "This was the\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",
      "This\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.",
      "I slaked my thirst\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
      "It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",
      "Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight.",
      "I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.",
      "Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\npleasure.",
      "I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees.",
      "[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder.",
      "It moved slowly,\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.",
      "I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",
      "No distinct\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused.",
      "I felt light, and hunger,\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.",
      "Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother.",
      "I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.",
      "I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes.",
      "I began also to observe,\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",
      "Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.",
      "Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.",
      "The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",
      "My\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\nday additional ideas.",
      "My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.",
      "I found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.",
      "One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it.",
      "In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",
      "How strange,\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",
      "I\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood.",
      "I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\nand would not burn.",
      "I was pained at this and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire.",
      "The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried and itself became inflamed.",
      "I reflected on this, and by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\nplentiful supply of fire.",
      "When night came on and brought sleep with\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",
      "I\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\ninto sleep.",
      "It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",
      "I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",
      "I\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished.",
      "When night came again I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",
      "I\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\nthe live embers.",
      "I found that the berries were spoiled by this\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",
      "Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",
      "When\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\nmore easily satisfied.",
      "In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\nto reproduce it.",
      "I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\ntowards the setting sun.",
      "I passed three days in these rambles and at\nlength discovered the open country.",
      "A great fall of snow had taken\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\ndamp substance that covered the ground.",
      "It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",
      "This\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\ncuriosity.",
      "Finding the door open, I entered.",
      "An old man sat in it,\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.",
      "He turned on\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\nhardly appeared capable.",
      "His appearance, different from any I had ever\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.",
      "But I was enchanted\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\nand divine a retreat as Pand monium appeared to the d mons of hell\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire.",
      "I greedily devoured the\nremnants of the shepherd s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.",
      "Then, overcome by\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",
      "It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant s breakfast in a\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\nat sunset I arrived at a village.",
      "How miraculous did this appear!",
      "The\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\nturns.",
      "The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",
      "One\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\nbeheld in the village.",
      "This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\ndared not enter it.",
      "My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",
      "No wood, however,\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",
      "Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\nfrom the barbarity of man.",
      "As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\nremain in the habitation I had found.",
      "It was situated against the back\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\nsty and a clear pool of water.",
      "One part was open, and by that I had\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\nthat was sufficient for me.",
      "Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.",
      "I\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\nmy retreat.",
      "The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\ntolerably warm.",
      "Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination.",
      "It was\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",
      "I ate my breakfast with\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",
      "The\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be.",
      "Yet she was meanly dressed, a\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\nhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad.",
      "I lost\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",
      "As she walked along,\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence.",
      "Uttering a few sounds with\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\ncottage himself.",
      "She followed, and they disappeared.",
      "Presently I saw\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.",
      "On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\nfilled up with wood.",
      "In one of these was a small and almost\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\nbut very bare of furniture.",
      "In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",
      "The\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\nnightingale.",
      "It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\nnever beheld aught beautiful before.",
      "The silver hair and benevolent\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\nmanners of the girl enticed my love.",
      "He played a sweet mournful air\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\nat his feet.",
      "He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.",
      "Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\nload of wood.",
      "The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",
      "She seemed\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire.",
      "She afterwards continued her\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots.",
      "After he had been employed\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\ncottage together.",
      "The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\neat.",
      "The meal was quickly dispatched.",
      "The young woman was again\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\ncreatures.",
      "One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",
      "The\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\nfields.",
      "Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",
      "In the evening\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\nthe morning.",
      "So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\nharmony of the old man s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\nscience of words or letters.",
      "The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.",
      "Chapter 12\n\n\n I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",
      "I thought of the\noccurrences of the day.",
      "What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.",
      "I\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\nmotives which influenced their actions.",
      "The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.",
      "The young woman\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\nafter the first meal.",
      "This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.",
      "The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\nvarious laborious occupations within.",
      "The old man, whom I soon\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\nin contemplation.",
      "Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.",
      "They\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
      "They were not entirely happy.",
      "The young man and his companion often\nwent apart and appeared to weep.",
      "I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\nbut I was deeply affected by it.",
      "If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched.",
      "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
      "They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one another s company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness.",
      "What did their tears imply?",
      "Did they\nreally express pain?",
      "I was at first unable to solve these questions,\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.",
      "A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree.",
      "Their nourishment\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\ncould scarcely procure food to support it.",
      "They often, I believe,\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\nman when they reserved none for themselves.",
      "This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.",
      "I had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",
      "I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours.",
      "I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
      "I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\npile of wood on the outside.",
      "She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",
      "I observed, with pleasure,\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\ncottage and cultivating the garden.",
      "By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.",
      "I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds.",
      "I perceived that the words\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\nminds and countenances of the hearers.",
      "This was indeed a godlike science,\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",
      "But I was baffled in\nevery attempt I made for this purpose.",
      "Their pronunciation was quick, and\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\nmystery of their reference.",
      "By great application, however, and after having\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.",
      "The youth\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\none, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_.",
      "I cannot\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them.",
      "I distinguished several other\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\ndearest, unhappy._\n\n I spent the winter in this manner.",
      "The gentle manners and beauty of\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.",
      "I saw\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends.",
      "The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy.",
      "He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me.",
      "Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.",
      "It was not thus\nwith Felix.",
      "He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends.",
      "But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.",
      "I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",
      "In the midst of poverty\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",
      "Early in\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\nhand.",
      "In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\nyet brought no wood with him.",
      "At other times he worked in the garden,\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\nman and Agatha.",
      "This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\nhe talked.",
      "I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs?",
      "I improved, however,\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",
      "I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool!",
      "At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",
      "Alas!",
      "I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\ndeformity.",
      "As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",
      "From this\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared.",
      "Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",
      "Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\nadvanced.",
      "The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters.",
      "This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
      "My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.",
      "During the morning I\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\nobserving my friends.",
      "When they had retired to rest, if there was any\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage.",
      "When I returned, as often as it\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\noffices that I had seen done by Felix.",
      "I afterwards found that these\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\nspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\nof these terms.",
      "My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.",
      "I thought\n(foolish wretch!)",
      "that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people.",
      "When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\nflitted before me.",
      "I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny.",
      "I formed in my imagination a\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\nme.",
      "I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\nafterwards their love.",
      "These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language.",
      "My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",
      "It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.",
      "The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth.",
      "Men who before this change seemed to have been\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation.",
      "The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\nbegan to bud forth on the trees.",
      "Happy, happy earth!",
      "Fit habitation\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\nunwholesome.",
      "My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.",
      "Chapter 13\n\n\n I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.",
      "I shall relate\nevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\nhave made me what I am.",
      "Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\ncloudless.",
      "It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.",
      "My\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\na thousand sights of beauty.",
      "It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\nfrom labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children\nlistened to him that I observed the countenance of Felix was\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\nthe cause of his son s sorrow.",
      "Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",
      "It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.",
      "The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\nveil.",
      "Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",
      "Her voice was\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends.",
      "On hearing this word,\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",
      "Her\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\na lovely pink.",
      "Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger.",
      "She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",
      "She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled.",
      "He assisted her to dismount, and\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.",
      "Some\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\nstranger knelt at the old man s feet and would have kissed his hand,\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",
      "I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\nby nor herself understood the cottagers.",
      "They made many signs which I\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\nmorning mists.",
      "Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\ndelight welcomed his Arabian.",
      "Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\ncame.",
      "Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.",
      "Presently I\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\nsame instructions to the same end.",
      "The stranger learned about twenty\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.",
      "As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",
      "When they\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said,  Good night\nsweet Safie.",
      "He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\nguest was the subject of their conversation.",
      "I ardently desired to\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\nit utterly impossible.",
      "The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\neyes.",
      "She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.",
      "When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\ndeclined it.",
      "She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",
      "The old\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",
      "The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",
      "Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\nof the words uttered by my protectors.",
      "In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",
      "My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\nthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\nwas spoken.",
      "While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\nit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\nfor wonder and delight.",
      "The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney s _Ruins\nof Empires_.",
      "I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",
      "He had chosen this\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\nEastern authors.",
      "Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\nnations of the earth.",
      "I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\nof the early Romans of their subsequent degenerating of the\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.",
      "I heard\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.",
      "These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.",
      "Was\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\nvicious and base?",
      "He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\ngodlike.",
      "To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.",
      "For a long time I\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\nloathing.",
      "Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.",
      "While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.",
      "I\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",
      "The words induced me to turn towards myself.",
      "I learned that the\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\nunsullied descent united with riches.",
      "A man might be respected with\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!",
      "And what was I?",
      "Of\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.",
      "I was, besides,\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\nof the same nature as man.",
      "I was more agile than they and could\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.",
      "When I looked\naround I saw and heard of none like me.",
      "Was I, then, a monster, a blot\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?",
      "I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\nknowledge.",
      "Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\nknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",
      "Of what a strange nature is knowledge!",
      "It clings to the mind when it\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.",
      "I wished sometimes to\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state\nwhich I feared yet did not understand.",
      "I admired virtue and good\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\nbecoming one among my fellows.",
      "The gentle words of Agatha and the\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.",
      "The mild\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\nFelix were not for me.",
      "Miserable, unhappy wretch!",
      "Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.",
      "I heard of the\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.",
      "But where were my friends and relations?",
      "No father had watched my\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\ndistinguished nothing.",
      "From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\nthen was in height and proportion.",
      "I had never yet seen a being\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.",
      "What was I?",
      "The\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.",
      "I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).",
      "Chapter 14\n\n\n Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.",
      "It was\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.",
      "The name of the old man was De Lacey.",
      "He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.",
      "His son was bred\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction.",
      "A few months before my arrival they had lived in\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",
      "The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.",
      "He was a\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.",
      "He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him.",
      "He was tried and condemned to death.",
      "The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.",
      "Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\ncourt.",
      "He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\nlooked around for the means.",
      "After many fruitless attempts to gain\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\nexecution of the barbarous sentence.",
      "Felix visited the grate at night\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.",
      "The Turk,\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\nby promises of reward and wealth.",
      "Felix rejected his offers with\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.",
      "The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety.",
      "Felix was too delicate to\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.",
      "During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father who understood French.",
      "She thanked him in\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
      "I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.",
      "Before I depart I will\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\nthe substance of them to you.",
      "Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her.",
      "The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced.",
      "She instructed her daughter in\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Muhammad.",
      "This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue.",
      "The prospect of marrying a Christian and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety was enchanting to her.",
      "The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris.",
      "Felix had procured passports in the name of\nhis father, sister, and himself.",
      "He had previously communicated his\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\nan obscure part of Paris.",
      "Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",
      "Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection.",
      "They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
      "The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans.",
      "He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited.",
      "He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.",
      "His plans\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
      "The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.",
      "The\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\nthrown into prison.",
      "The news reached Felix and roused him from his\ndream of pleasure.",
      "His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\nher whom he loved.",
      "This idea was torture to him.",
      "He quickly arranged\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",
      "He did not succeed.",
      "They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",
      "They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them.",
      "Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",
      "Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",
      "He could\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.",
      "The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.",
      "When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country.",
      "The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.",
      "A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter s apartment and told\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",
      "He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",
      "When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency.",
      "A residence in Turkey\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\nto it.",
      "By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\nhe then resided.",
      "She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination.",
      "Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.",
      "She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",
      "She fell, however,\ninto good hands.",
      "The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\nthe cottage of her lover.",
      "Chapter 15\n\n\n Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.",
      "It impressed me deeply.",
      "I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",
      "As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\nwere called forth and displayed.",
      "But in giving an account of the\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",
      "One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\nsome books.",
      "I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.",
      "Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\nof _Plutarch s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_.",
      "The\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.",
      "I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.",
      "They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",
      "In\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",
      "The gentle and\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom.",
      "But I thought Werter himself a\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep.",
      "The disquisitions upon\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.",
      "I did not\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\nunderstanding it.",
      "As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition.",
      "I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\nwas a listener.",
      "I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.",
      "The path of my departure was free,  and there was none to lament my\nannihilation.",
      "My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.",
      "What did\nthis mean?",
      "Who was I?",
      "What was I?",
      "Whence did I come?",
      "What was my\ndestination?",
      "These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.",
      "The volume of _Plutarch s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics.",
      "This book\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.",
      "I\nlearned from Werter s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",
      "Many\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience.",
      "I had a very\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\nand boundless seas.",
      "But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\nlarge assemblages of men.",
      "The cottage of my protectors had been the\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action.",
      "I read of men concerned\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species.",
      "I felt the\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.",
      "Induced by these\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.",
      "The\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\nhave been imbued with different sensations.",
      "But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.",
      "I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history.",
      "It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting.",
      "I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own.",
      "Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\nin every other respect.",
      "He had come forth from the hands of God a\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",
      "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\ngall of envy rose within me.",
      "Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.",
      "Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory.",
      "At first I had\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",
      "It was\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation.",
      "You\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\noccurrences.",
      "You doubtless recollect these papers.",
      "Here they are.",
      "Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible.",
      "I sickened as I read.",
      "Hateful\nday when I received life!",
      "I exclaimed in agony.",
      "Accursed creator!",
      "Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\ndisgust?",
      "God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\nvery resemblance.",
      "Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.",
      "These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.",
      "Could they turn\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\nand friendship?",
      "I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.",
      "I\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",
      "Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\nday s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",
      "Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.",
      "The\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",
      "Felix and Agatha\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\ntheir labours by servants.",
      "They did not appear rich, but they were\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\nmine became every day more tumultuous.",
      "Increase of knowledge only\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.",
      "I\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\nimage and that inconstant shade.",
      "I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\nsmiles of consolation.",
      "But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.",
      "I remembered Adam s\nsupplication to his Creator.",
      "But where was mine?",
      "He had abandoned me,\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",
      "Autumn passed thus.",
      "I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",
      "Yet I did\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat.",
      "But my chief\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\ntowards the cottagers.",
      "Their happiness was not decreased by the\nabsence of summer.",
      "They loved and sympathised with one another; and\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\ncasualties that took place around them.",
      "The more I saw of them, the\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\nlimit of my ambition.",
      "I dared not think that they would turn them from\nme with disdain and horror.",
      "The poor that stopped at their door were\nnever driven away.",
      "I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\nlittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.",
      "The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life.",
      "My attention at this time was solely\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\nprotectors.",
      "I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",
      "I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\nbeheld me.",
      "My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.",
      "One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage.",
      "When his children had departed,\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",
      "At first his\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
      "My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears.",
      "The servants were gone to a\nneighbouring fair.",
      "All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground.",
      "Again I rose, and exerting\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",
      "The fresh air revived\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\ncottage.",
      "I knocked.",
      "Who is there?",
      "said the old man.",
      "Come in.",
      "I entered.",
      "Pardon this intrusion,  said I;  I am\na traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\nwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.",
      "Enter,  said De Lacey,  and I will try in what\nmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\nfrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\nprocure food for you.",
      "Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\nwarmth and rest only that I need.",
      "I sat down, and a silence ensued.",
      "I knew that every minute was\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\nthe interview, when the old man addressed me.",
      "By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\nFrench?",
      "No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\nlanguage only.",
      "I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.",
      "Are they Germans?",
      "No, they are French.",
      "But let us change the subject.",
      "I am an\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\nor friend upon earth.",
      "These amiable people to whom I go have never\nseen me and know little of me.",
      "I am full of fears, for if I fail\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.",
      "Do not despair.",
      "To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\nthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\nfull of brotherly love and charity.",
      "Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\nand if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.",
      "They are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.",
      "I have good\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\nmonster.",
      "That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\nyou undeceive them?",
      "I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors.",
      "I tenderly love these friends; I\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.",
      "Where do these friends reside?",
      "Near this spot.",
      "The old man paused and then continued,  If you will unreservedly\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\nundeceiving them.",
      "I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\nsincere.",
      "I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.",
      "Excellent man!",
      "I thank you and accept your generous offer.",
      "You\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\ncreatures.",
      "Heaven forbid!",
      "Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.",
      "I also am\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.",
      "How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
      "From your lips\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.",
      "May I know the names and residence of those friends?",
      "I paused.",
      "This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.",
      "I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.",
      "At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.",
      "I had not a moment\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried,  Now is the\ntime!",
      "Save and protect me!",
      "You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek.",
      "Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!",
      "Great God!",
      "exclaimed the old man.",
      "Who are you?",
      "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered.",
      "Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me?",
      "Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage.",
      "Felix darted forward, and with\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\nwith a stick.",
      "I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\nthe antelope.",
      "But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\nI refrained.",
      "I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.",
      "Chapter 16\n\n\n Cursed, cursed creator!",
      "Why did I live?",
      "Why, in that instant, did I\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\nbestowed?",
      "I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge.",
      "I could with pleasure have\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\ntheir shrieks and misery.",
      "When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings.",
      "I was like a wild beast that had broken\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness.",
      "Oh!",
      "What a miserable\nnight I passed!",
      "The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness.",
      "All, save I, were at rest\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\nthe ruin.",
      "But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair.",
      "There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies?",
      "No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
      "The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day.",
      "Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.",
      "The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions.",
      "I had certainly acted imprudently.",
      "It was apparent that\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.",
      "I\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\nbeen prepared for my approach.",
      "But I did not believe my errors to be\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\nparty.",
      "These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams.",
      "The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father s feet.",
      "I awoke exhausted, and finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.",
      "When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage.",
      "All there was at peace.",
      "I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\naccustomed hour when the family arose.",
      "That hour passed, the sun\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.",
      "I\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.",
      "The inside\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\nagony of this suspense.",
      "Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors.",
      "Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
      "Do you consider,  said his companion to him,\n that you will be obliged to pay three months  rent and to lose\nthe produce of your garden?",
      "I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\ndetermination.",
      "It is utterly useless,  replied Felix;  we can\nnever again inhabit your cottage.",
      "The life of my father is in the greatest\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.",
      "My wife and\nmy sister will never recover from their horror.",
      "I entreat you not to reason\nwith me any more.",
      "Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\nplace.",
      "Felix trembled violently as he said this.",
      "He and his companion\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted.",
      "I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.",
      "I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair.",
      "My protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world.",
      "For the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death.",
      "When I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me.",
      "But again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.",
      "As\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
      "As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.",
      "I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched.",
      "A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected.",
      "The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
      "As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.",
      "And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
      "I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible.",
      "At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind.",
      "I learned from your papers that you\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\nthan to him who had given me life?",
      "Among the lessons that Felix had\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.",
      "You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\nthis place I resolved to proceed.",
      "But how was I to direct myself?",
      "I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide.",
      "I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair.",
      "From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.",
      "Unfeeling,\nheartless creator!",
      "You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.",
      "But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\nany other being that wore the human form.",
      "My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.",
      "It was\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.",
      "I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\nhuman being.",
      "Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.",
      "Oh,\nearth!",
      "How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!",
      "The\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\nand bitterness.",
      "The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",
      "Snow\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.",
      "A few incidents\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\noften wandered wide from my path.",
      "The agony of my feelings allowed me\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.",
      "I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man.",
      "One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air.",
      "I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me.",
      "Half surprised by the novelty of\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.",
      "Soft tears\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.",
      "I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.",
      "Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\nof a cypress.",
      "I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\nsomeone in sport.",
      "She continued her course along the precipitous sides\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\nrapid stream.",
      "I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.",
      "She\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.",
      "On\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.",
      "I followed speedily, I\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired.",
      "I sank to the ground, and my\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.",
      "This was then the reward of my benevolence!",
      "I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.",
      "The feelings of\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.",
      "Inflamed by\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.",
      "But the\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",
      "For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received.",
      "The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it.",
      "My sufferings were augmented\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction.",
      "My daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge,\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\nendured.",
      "After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.",
      "The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.",
      "But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\nreached the environs of Geneva.",
      "It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you.",
      "I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.",
      "At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy.",
      "Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity.",
      "If, therefore, I could seize him and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.",
      "Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\ntowards me.",
      "As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\nface and said,  Child, what is the meaning of this?",
      "I do not intend to\nhurt you; listen to me.",
      "He struggled violently.",
      "Let me go,  he cried;\n monster!",
      "Ugly wretch!",
      "You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.",
      "You\nare an ogre.",
      "Let me go, or I will tell my papa.",
      "Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.",
      "Hideous monster!",
      "Let me go.",
      "My papa is a syndic he is M.\nFrankenstein he will punish you.",
      "You dare not keep me.",
      "Frankenstein!",
      "you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom I have\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.",
      "The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.",
      "I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed,  I too can create desolation;\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.",
      "As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast.",
      "I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.",
      "In spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me.",
      "For a few moments I\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\nexpressive of disgust and affright.",
      "Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?",
      "I only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.",
      "While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.",
      "A woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health.",
      "Here, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.",
      "And then I bent over\nher and whispered,  Awake, fairest, thy lover is near he who would\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\nbeloved, awake!",
      "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.",
      "Should she\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?",
      "Thus\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.",
      "The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me not I, but\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.",
      "The crime had\nits source in her; be hers the punishment!",
      "Thanks to the lessons of\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\nmischief.",
      "I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\nthe folds of her dress.",
      "She moved again, and I fled.",
      "For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\nits miseries for ever.",
      "At length I wandered towards these mountains,\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\npassion which you alone can gratify.",
      "We may not part until you have\npromised to comply with my requisition.",
      "I am alone and miserable; man\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\nwould not deny herself to me.",
      "My companion must be of the same species\nand have the same defects.",
      "This being you must create.",
      "Chapter 17\n\n\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\nexpectation of a reply.",
      "But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\nproposition.",
      "He continued,\n\n You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.",
      "This you alone\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\nconcede.",
      "The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\nme.",
      "I do refuse it,  I replied;  and no torture shall ever extort a\nconsent from me.",
      "You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\nshall never make me base in my own eyes.",
      "Shall I create another like\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.",
      "Begone!",
      "I\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.",
      "You are in the wrong,  replied the fiend;  and instead\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you.",
      "I am malicious because I\nam miserable.",
      "Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
      "You, my creator,\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\nshould pity man more than he pities me?",
      "You would not call it murder if you\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\nwork of your own hands.",
      "Shall I respect man when he condemns me?",
      "Let him\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.",
      "But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\nunion.",
      "Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.",
      "I will\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\ninextinguishable hatred.",
      "Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\nyour birth.",
      "A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\ninto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\nhe calmed himself and proceeded \n\n I intended to reason.",
      "This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\nnot reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess.",
      "If any being felt\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\nhundredfold; for that one creature s sake I would make peace with the\nwhole kind!",
      "But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.",
      "What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me.",
      "It is true, we shall be\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\nattached to one another.",
      "Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel.",
      "Oh!",
      "My creator, make me\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!",
      "Let me see that I\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\nrequest!",
      "I was moved.",
      "I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.",
      "His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow?",
      "He saw my change of\nfeeling and continued,\n\n If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.",
      "My food is not\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.",
      "My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.",
      "We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman and will ripen our food.",
      "The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty.",
      "Pitiless as you have been towards me,\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.",
      "You propose,  replied I,  to fly from the habitations of\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\nonly companions.",
      "How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile?",
      "You will return and again seek their kindness, and\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.",
      "This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.",
      "How inconstant are your feelings!",
      "But a moment ago you were moved by\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",
      "I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.",
      "My evil passions\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!",
      "My life will flow quietly\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.",
      "His words had a strange effect upon me.",
      "I compassionated him and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.",
      "I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.",
      "You swear,  I said,  to be harmless; but have you not\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\nyou?",
      "May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?",
      "How is this?",
      "I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.",
      "If\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.",
      "My vices\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.",
      "I shall feel\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.",
      "I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\narguments which he had employed.",
      "I thought of the promise of virtues which\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\nmanifested towards him.",
      "His power and threats were not omitted in my\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.",
      "After a\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.",
      "Turning to him, therefore, I said,\n\n I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.",
      "I swear,  he cried,  by the sun, and by the blue sky of\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.",
      "Depart to your\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\nappear.",
      "Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\nmy sentiments.",
      "I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\nsea of ice.",
      "His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed.",
      "I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow.",
      "The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\nof the day had produced.",
      "Night was far advanced when I came to the\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.",
      "The stars\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\nthoughts within me.",
      "I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\nexclaimed,  Oh!",
      "stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.",
      "These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\nhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\nlistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\nway to consume me.",
      "Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva.",
      "Even in my own heart I could\ngive no expression to my sensations they weighed on me with a\nmountain s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.",
      "Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\nfamily.",
      "My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak.",
      "I felt as if I were placed\nunder a ban as if I had no right to claim their sympathies as if\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them.",
      "Yet even thus I\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\nmyself to my most abhorred task.",
      "The prospect of such an occupation\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.",
      "Chapter 18\n\n\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work.",
      "I feared the\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me.",
      "I found that I could not\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\nstudy and laborious disquisition.",
      "I had heard of some discoveries\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\nfather s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\nme.",
      "A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.",
      "My\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine.",
      "At these moments I took\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude.",
      "I passed whole days on the lake\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless.",
      "But the fresh air and\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\nand a more cheerful heart.",
      "It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,\n\n I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.",
      "And yet you are still\nunhappy and still avoid our society.",
      "For some time I was lost in\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.",
      "Reserve on such a\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.",
      "I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued \n\n I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\nstay of my declining years.",
      "You were attached to each other from your\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\ntastes, entirely suited to one another.",
      "But so blind is the experience of\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\nentirely destroyed it.",
      "You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\nwish that she might become your wife.",
      "Nay, you may have met with another\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\nto feel.",
      "My dear father, reassure yourself.",
      "I love my cousin tenderly and\nsincerely.",
      "I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\nwarmest admiration and affection.",
      "My future hopes and prospects are\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.",
      "The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.",
      "If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us.",
      "But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.",
      "Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\nmarriage.",
      "We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",
      "You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed.",
      "Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness.",
      "Interpret my words\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.",
      "I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply.",
      "I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.",
      "Alas!",
      "To me\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay.",
      "I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family!",
      "Could I enter into a festival\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\nground?",
      "I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\nwhich I expected peace.",
      "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking.",
      "The latter method of obtaining\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\nloathsome task in my father s house while in habits of familiar\nintercourse with those I loved.",
      "I knew that a thousand fearful\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\nthrill all connected with me with horror.",
      "I was aware also that I\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\nunearthly occupation.",
      "I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\nemployed.",
      "Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness.",
      "My promise fulfilled,\nthe monster would depart for ever.",
      "Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\nslavery for ever.",
      "These feelings dictated my answer to my father.",
      "I expressed a wish to\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply.",
      "After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.",
      "The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated.",
      "One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.",
      "Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.",
      "This interfered\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection.",
      "Nay, Henry might stand between\nme and the intrusion of my foe.",
      "If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\ncontemplate its progress?",
      "To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.",
      "My father s\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay.",
      "For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\nforget the past in my union with her.",
      "I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation.",
      "During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture.",
      "But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\nwould he not accompany me to England?",
      "This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",
      "I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\nthis might happen.",
      "But through the whole period during which I was the\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.",
      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\ncountry.",
      "My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.",
      "It had\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval and yet a man\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman s\nsedulous attention.",
      "She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\nfarewell.",
      "I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",
      "I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme.",
      "Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.",
      "I could\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\nme whilst they endured.",
      "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\nClerval.",
      "He came.",
      "Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",
      "He\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\nday.",
      "He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\nthe appearances of the sky.",
      "This is what it is to live,  he cried;\n now I enjoy existence!",
      "But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\nyou desponding and sorrowful!",
      "In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine.",
      "And you, my friend, would be far more\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.",
      "I, a\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\nenjoyment.",
      "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",
      "During this\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.",
      "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz.",
      "The course of the Rhine below Mainz\nbecomes much more picturesque.",
      "The river descends rapidly and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",
      "We saw\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\nblack woods, high and inaccessible.",
      "This part of the Rhine, indeed,\npresents a singularly variegated landscape.",
      "In one spot you view\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\nand populous towns occupy the scene.",
      "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\nas we glided down the stream.",
      "Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",
      "I lay at the\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.",
      "And if these\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?",
      "He felt as if he had\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\nman.",
      "I have seen,  he said,  the most beautiful scenes\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",
      "The\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.",
      "Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain.",
      "Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\nour own country.",
      "Clerval!",
      "Beloved friend!",
      "Even now it delights me to record your words and\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.",
      "He was a\nbeing formed in the  very poetry of nature.",
      "His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.",
      "His\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\nin the imagination.",
      "But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\nsatisfy his eager mind.",
      "The scenery of external nature, which others regard\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour: \n\n     The sounding cataract\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\n    Unborrow d from the eye.",
      "[Wordsworth s  Tintern Abbey .]",
      "And where does he now exist?",
      "Is this gentle and lovely being lost\nfor ever?",
      "Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\nlife of its creator; has this mind perished?",
      "Does it now only exist\nin my memory?",
      "No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\nconsoles your unhappy friend.",
      "Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",
      "I will\nproceed with my tale.",
      "Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.",
      "Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.",
      "It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\nthe white cliffs of Britain.",
      "The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\nremembrance of some story.",
      "We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich places which I had heard\nof even in my country.",
      "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul s towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.",
      "Chapter 19\n\n\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city.",
      "Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\ndistinguished natural philosophers.",
      "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",
      "But a blight had\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\nwas so terribly profound.",
      "Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\npeace.",
      "But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart.",
      "I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul with anguish.",
      "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction.",
      "The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement.",
      "He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view.",
      "His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\nEuropean colonization and trade.",
      "In Britain only could he further the\nexecution of his plan.",
      "He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",
      "I tried to conceal this\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection.",
      "I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",
      "I now also\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\non the head.",
      "Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",
      "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",
      "He mentioned the\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\nwhere he resided.",
      "Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",
      "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary.",
      "We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month.",
      "In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\nthis tour about the end of July.",
      "I packed up my chemical instruments and\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",
      "We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",
      "This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer were all novelties to us.",
      "From thence we proceeded to Oxford.",
      "As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before.",
      "It was here that Charles\nI. had collected his forces.",
      "This city had remained faithful to him,\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nParliament and liberty.",
      "The memory of that unfortunate king and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited.",
      "The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",
      "If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",
      "The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.",
      "I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future.",
      "I was formed\nfor peaceful happiness.",
      "During my youthful days discontent never\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits.",
      "But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\nI shall soon cease to be a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",
      "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history.",
      "Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves.",
      "We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell.",
      "For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\nand the remembrancers.",
      "For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\nmiserable self.",
      "We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest.",
      "The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\nnative country.",
      "We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",
      "The latter name\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",
      "From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland.",
      "I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains.",
      "The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.",
      "Here also we\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\nhappiness.",
      "The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\ninferiors.",
      "I could pass my life here,  said he to me;  and among\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.",
      "But he found that a traveller s life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments.",
      "His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
      "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on.",
      "For my own part I was not sorry.",
      "I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the d mon s\ndisappointment.",
      "He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives.",
      "This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.",
      "I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate.",
      "Sometimes I thought that the fiend\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.",
      "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\nhis destroyer.",
      "I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\nconsciousness of which haunted me.",
      "I was guiltless, but I had indeed\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",
      "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being.",
      "Clerval did not like it so well\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.",
      "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur s\nSeat, St. Bernard s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",
      "But I was\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.",
      "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew s, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",
      "But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone.",
      "Do you,  said I,  enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous.",
      "I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.",
      "Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate.",
      "He entreated me to write often.",
      "I had rather be with\nyou,  he said,  in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\nyour absence.",
      "Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\nScotland and finish my work in solitude.",
      "I did not doubt but that the\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.",
      "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.",
      "It was a place\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves.",
      "The soil was barren, scarcely\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\ngave tokens of their miserable fare.",
      "Vegetables and bread, when they\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.",
      "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived.",
      "This I hired.",
      "It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury.",
      "The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges.",
      "I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty.",
      "As it was, I lived ungazed at\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\nof men.",
      "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.",
      "It was a\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene.",
      "I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape.",
      "Its hills\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains.",
      "Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
      "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me.",
      "Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work.",
      "It was, indeed, a filthy process in\nwhich I was engaged.",
      "During my first experiment, a kind of\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings.",
      "But now I went to it in\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",
      "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\ngrew restless and nervous.",
      "Every moment I feared to meet my\npersecutor.",
      "Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\ndreaded to behold.",
      "I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.",
      "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced.",
      "I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.",
      "Chapter 20\n\n\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\nto it.",
      "As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing.",
      "Three years before, I was\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\nremorse.",
      "I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.",
      "He had\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\ncreation.",
      "They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form?",
      "She also might turn\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species.",
      "Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d mon\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\ncondition precarious and full of terror.",
      "Had I right, for my own benefit,\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
      "I had before been moved\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",
      "I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\nthe light of the moon the d mon at the casement.",
      "A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me.",
      "Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.",
      "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery.",
      "I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.",
      "The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",
      "I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment.",
      "I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\nterrible reveries.",
      "Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon.",
      "A few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another.",
      "I felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house.",
      "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly.",
      "I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.",
      "Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",
      "Shutting the door, he\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,\n\n You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend?",
      "Do you dare to break your promise?",
      "I have endured toil and misery;\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills.",
      "I have dwelt many\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.",
      "I have\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\nhopes?",
      "Begone!",
      "I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.",
      "Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension.",
      "Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\nday will be hateful to you.",
      "You are my creator, but I am your master;\nobey!",
      "The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived.",
      "Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice.",
      "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d mon whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness?",
      "Begone!",
      "I am firm, and your\nwords will only exasperate my rage.",
      "The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\nimpotence of anger.",
      "Shall each man,  cried he,  find a\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?",
      "I had\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.",
      "Man!",
      "You may hate, but beware!",
      "Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\never.",
      "Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\nwretchedness?",
      "You can blast my other passions, but revenge\nremains revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!",
      "I may die, but\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\nmisery.",
      "Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.",
      "I will watch with\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.",
      "Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.",
      "Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.",
      "I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\nbeneath words.",
      "Leave me; I am inexorable.",
      "It is well.",
      "I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.",
      "I started forward and exclaimed,  Villain!",
      "Before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.",
      "I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\nprecipitation.",
      "In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\nwaves.",
      "All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.",
      "I burned with rage to\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.",
      "I\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",
      "Why had I not\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife?",
      "But I had suffered him\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.",
      "I shuddered\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.",
      "And then I thought again of his words _I will be with you on\nyour wedding-night._  That, then, was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny.",
      "In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\nextinguish his malice.",
      "The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.",
      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\nthe depths of despair.",
      "I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\nnight s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.",
      "I\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.",
      "If I returned, it was to\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\nd mon whom I had myself created.",
      "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved and miserable in the separation.",
      "When it became noon, and the\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep.",
      "I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",
      "The sleep\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\njoin him.",
      "He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\nIndian enterprise.",
      "He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\nmy society on him as I could spare.",
      "He besought me, therefore, to\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\nsouthwards together.",
      "This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.",
      "The next\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\nof my laboratory.",
      "The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\nmangled the living flesh of a human being.",
      "I paused to collect myself and\nthen entered the chamber.",
      "With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\nchemical apparatus.",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d mon.",
      "I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\nclearly.",
      "The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",
      "I had resolved in\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\nbut I sailed away from them.",
      "I felt as if I was about the commission of a\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\nfellow creatures.",
      "At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot.",
      "The sky became clouded, but\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\nrising.",
      "But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",
      "Clouds hid the\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\nslept soundly.",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably.",
      "The wind was high, and\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",
      "I found\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\nwhich I had embarked.",
      "I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\nwater.",
      "Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.",
      "I\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror.",
      "I had no compass with me\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me.",
      "I might be driven into the\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.",
      "I had already\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\nmy other sufferings.",
      "I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\nsea; it was to be my grave.",
      "Fiend,  I exclaimed,  your\ntask is already fulfilled!",
      "I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\nof Clerval all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\nsanguinary and merciless passions.",
      "This idea plunged me into a reverie so\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\nfree from breakers.",
      "But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\nof life even in the excess of misery!",
      "I constructed another sail with a\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.",
      "It had a\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\nthe traces of cultivation.",
      "I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.",
      "I\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory.",
      "As I was in a state of\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment.",
      "Fortunately I had money with\nme.",
      "As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\nescape.",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot.",
      "They seemed much surprised at my\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm.",
      "As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.",
      "My\ngood friends,  said I,  will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\nthis town and inform me where I am?",
      "You will know that soon enough,  replied a man with a hoarse voice.",
      "Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions.",
      "Why do you answer me so\nroughly?",
      "I replied.",
      "Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.",
      "I do not know,  said the man,  what the custom of the\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease.",
      "Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me.",
      "I inquired the way to the inn, but\nno one replied.",
      "I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said,  Come, sir, you must\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin s to give an account of yourself.",
      "Who is Mr. Kirwin?",
      "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
      "Is not\nthis a free country?",
      "Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.",
      "Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\nfound murdered here last night.",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.",
      "I was innocent;\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town.",
      "I was ready to sink from\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\napprehension or conscious guilt.",
      "Little did I then expect the calamity that\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\nall fear of ignominy or death.",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\nrecollection.",
      "Chapter 21\n\n\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners.",
      "He looked upon me, however,\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o clock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\nfor port.",
      "It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\ntwo miles below.",
      "He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\nand his companions followed him at some distance.",
      "As he was proceeding\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\nlength on the ground.",
      "His companions came up to assist him, and by the\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\nwho was to all appearance dead.",
      "Their first supposition was that it was the\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\nthat the body was not then cold.",
      "They instantly carried it to the cottage\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\nto life.",
      "It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\nyears of age.",
      "He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\nsupport.",
      "The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.",
      "The son confirmed his father s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\nboat in which I had just landed.",
      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\nwas afterwards found.",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\nbody into her house; it was not cold.",
      "They put it into a bed and\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\nquite gone.",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\nof the town of   from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me.",
      "This idea was probably\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\nmurder had been described.",
      "I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\nand several other persons, to the inn.",
      "I could not help being struck by the\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.",
      "How\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
      "I feel yet parched with\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\nagony.",
      "The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\nClerval stretched before me.",
      "I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\nthe body, I exclaimed,  Have my murderous machinations deprived you\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life?",
      "Two I have already destroyed; other\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\nbenefactor \n\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",
      "A fever succeeded to this.",
      "I lay for two months on the point of death; my\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",
      "Sometimes I entreated my\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",
      "Fortunately, as I spoke\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",
      "Why did I not die?",
      "More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\nsink into forgetfulness and rest?",
      "Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",
      "Of what materials was I\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\nme.",
      "She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class.",
      "The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.",
      "Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",
      "Are you better now, sir?",
      "said she.",
      "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice,  I believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.",
      "For that matter,  replied the old woman,  if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!",
      "However, that s none\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.",
      "I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",
      "The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",
      "The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\nsecond.",
      "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\nhangman who would gain his fee?",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness.",
      "He had caused the best room in the prison\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\nhad provided a physician and a nurse.",
      "It is true, he seldom came to\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer.",
      "He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\nintervals.",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death.",
      "I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.",
      "At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.",
      "Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\nmine and addressed me in French,\n\n I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\nmake you more comfortable?",
      "I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.",
      "I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.",
      "But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.",
      "That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals.",
      "Persecuted and tortured as I am and\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?",
      "Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\nstrange chances that have lately occurred.",
      "You were thrown, by some\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\nseized immediately, and charged with murder.",
      "The first sight that was\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\nyour path.",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",
      "I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\nto say,\n\n Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\nand illness.",
      "I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father.",
      "I instantly wrote\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.",
      "This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\nnow to lament?",
      "Your family is perfectly well,  said Mr. Kirwin with\ngentleness;  and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires.",
      "I put my hand before my eyes,\nand cried out in agony,\n\n Oh!",
      "Take him away!",
      "I cannot see him; for God s sake, do not\nlet him enter!",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.",
      "He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\nrather a severe tone,\n\n I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.",
      "My father!",
      "cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure.",
      "Is my father indeed come?",
      "How kind, how\nvery kind!",
      "But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?",
      "My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",
      "He rose and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",
      "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father.",
      "I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n\n Are you then safe and Elizabeth and Ernest?",
      "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\ncheerfulness.",
      "What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\nof the room.",
      "You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\nto pursue you.",
      "And poor Clerval \n\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.",
      "Alas!",
      "Yes, my father,  replied I;  some destiny of the\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.",
      "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity.",
      "Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.",
      "But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.",
      "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate.",
      "The image of Clerval was\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered.",
      "More than once the agitation\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse.",
      "Alas!",
      "Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\nlife?",
      "It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\ndrawing to a close.",
      "Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\nsink to rest.",
      "Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",
      "The season of the assizes approached.",
      "I had already been three months\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\ntown where the court was held.",
      "Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.",
      "I was spared\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death.",
      "The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.",
      "I did not\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful.",
      "The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",
      "Sometimes\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.",
      "He talked\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\nthese words only drew deep groans from me.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair.",
      "At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\ntriumphed over my selfish despair.",
      "It was necessary that I should\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous.",
      "My father still desired to\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck the shadow of a human being.",
      "My\nstrength was gone.",
      "I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\npreyed upon my wasted frame.",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\nmy father thought it best to yield.",
      "We took our passage on board a vessel\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.",
      "It was midnight.",
      "I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\nthe dashing of the waves.",
      "I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva.",
      "The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",
      "I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt.",
      "I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\nwhich he first lived.",
      "I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\nlife.",
      "Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",
      "But sleep did\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\nthousand objects that scared me.",
      "Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend s grasp in my neck and could not free\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.",
      "My father, who was\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\nsusceptible.",
      "Chapter 22\n\n\nThe voyage came to an end.",
      "We landed, and proceeded to Paris.",
      "I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey.",
      "My father s care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",
      "He wished me to\nseek amusement in society.",
      "I abhorred the face of man.",
      "Oh, not\nabhorred!",
      "They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism.",
      "But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse.",
      "I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.",
      "How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",
      "My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair.",
      "Sometimes he thought that I\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",
      "Alas!",
      "My father,  said I,  how little do you know me.",
      "Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\na wretch as I felt pride.",
      "Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this I murdered her.",
      "William, Justine, and Henry they all\ndied by my hands.",
      "My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\nconvalescence.",
      "I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\nconcerning the wretch I had created.",
      "I had a persuasion that I should be\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",
      "But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\nhis breast.",
      "I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",
      "Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\nfrom me.",
      "I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",
      "Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\n My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?",
      "My dear son, I entreat\nyou never to make such an assertion again.",
      "I am not mad,  I cried energetically;  the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",
      "I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.",
      "A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.",
      "The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",
      "He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.",
      "As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",
      "By the utmost\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.",
      "A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\n\n My dear Friend,\n\n It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight.",
      "My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered!",
      "I expect to see you looking even more ill than\nwhen you quitted Geneva.",
      "This winter has been passed most miserably,\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\ncomfort and tranquillity.",
      "Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",
      "I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.",
      "Explanation!",
      "You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?",
      "If\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.",
      "But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",
      "You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\nyour parents ever since our infancy.",
      "We were told this when young, and\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\nplace.",
      "We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",
      "But\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\ncase?",
      "Tell me, dearest Victor.",
      "Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\nhappiness, with simple truth Do you not love another?",
      "You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",
      "But this is false reasoning.",
      "I confess to you, my friend, that I love\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\nfriend and companion.",
      "But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.",
      "Even now\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.",
      "I, who\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.",
      "Ah!",
      "Victor, be assured\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\nmade miserable by this supposition.",
      "Be happy, my friend; and if you\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",
      "Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",
      "My uncle\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\nshall need no other happiness.",
      "Elizabeth Lavenza.",
      "Geneva, May 18th, 17 \n\n\n\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\nthe fiend _I will be with you on your\nwedding-night!_  Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\nd mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.",
      "On that night he\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death.",
      "Well, be it so; a\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.",
      "If he\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man.",
      "Alas!",
      "What freedom?",
      "Such as the\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\npenniless, and alone, but free.",
      "Such would be my liberty except that in my\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",
      "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!",
      "I read and reread her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\nangel s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",
      "Yet I would die to make\nher happy.",
      "If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",
      "My\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",
      "He had vowed\n_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\nafter the enunciation of his threats.",
      "I resolved, therefore, that if my\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\nfather s happiness, my adversary s designs against my life\nshould not retard it a single hour.",
      "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.",
      "My letter was calm and\naffectionate.",
      "I fear, my beloved girl,  I said,  little happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\nyou.",
      "Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\nand my endeavours for contentment.",
      "I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured.",
      "I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",
      "But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",
      "This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.",
      "In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth s letter we returned\nto Geneva.",
      "The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",
      "I saw a\nchange in her also.",
      "She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\nwas.",
      "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.",
      "Memory brought madness\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\ndespondent.",
      "I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",
      "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\nfeelings when sunk in torpor.",
      "She wept with me and for me.",
      "When reason\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation.",
      "Ah!",
      "It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\nguilty there is no peace.",
      "The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.",
      "Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\nElizabeth.",
      "I remained silent.",
      "Have you, then, some other attachment?",
      "None on earth.",
      "I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\ndelight.",
      "Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.",
      "My dear Victor, do not speak thus.",
      "Heavy misfortunes have befallen\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live.",
      "Our circle will be\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.",
      "And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\ndeprived.",
      "Such were the lessons of my father.",
      "But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words  _I shall be with\nyou on your wedding-night_,  I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable.",
      "But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\nthe seal to my fate.",
      "Great God!",
      "If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.",
      "But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.",
      "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",
      "But I concealed my\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\neye of Elizabeth.",
      "She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",
      "Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\nand all wore a smiling appearance.",
      "I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\ndecorations of my tragedy.",
      "Through my father s exertions a part of\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\ngovernment.",
      "A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.",
      "It\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\nnear which it stood.",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\nfiend should openly attack me.",
      "I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",
      "Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
      "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind.",
      "But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\npromised to reveal to her on the following day.",
      "My father was in the\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",
      "After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\nfather s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\nvoyage on the following day.",
      "The day was fair, the wind favourable;\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness.",
      "We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Sal ve, the pleasant banks of Montal gre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",
      "I took the hand of Elizabeth.",
      "You are sorrowful, my love.",
      "Ah!",
      "If\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\none day at least permits me to enjoy.",
      "Be happy, my dear Victor,  replied Elizabeth;  there is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented.",
      "Something whispers to me\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice.",
      "Observe how fast we move\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\ninteresting.",
      "Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\nthe bottom.",
      "What a divine day!",
      "How happy and serene all nature\nappears!",
      "Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\nreflection upon melancholy subjects.",
      "But her temper was fluctuating;\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\nto distraction and reverie.",
      "The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\nlower hills.",
      "The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",
      "The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
      "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\nhay.",
      "The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\nme and cling to me for ever.",
      "Chapter 23\n\n\nIt was eight o clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",
      "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\nin the west.",
      "The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\nthat were beginning to rise.",
      "Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.",
      "I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",
      "I was anxious\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\nof my adversary was extinguished.",
      "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\ntrembling, she asked,  What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?",
      "What is it you fear?",
      "Oh!",
      "Peace, peace, my love,  replied I;  this night, and\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.",
      "I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",
      "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\nmy adversary.",
      "But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream.",
      "It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.",
      "As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",
      "This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.",
      "Great God!",
      "Why did I not then expire!",
      "Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?",
      "She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",
      "Everywhere I\nturn I see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\nby the murderer on its bridal bier.",
      "Could I behold this and live?",
      "Alas!",
      "Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.",
      "For a moment\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.",
      "When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.",
      "I\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",
      "She had been moved from the\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\nsupposed her asleep.",
      "I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",
      "The murderous mark of the fiend s grasp was on her neck, and the\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.",
      "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.",
      "The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.",
      "The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.",
      "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.",
      "I rushed towards\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\nplunged into the lake.",
      "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.",
      "I pointed to\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain.",
      "After passing several hours, we\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\nform conjured up by my fancy.",
      "After having landed, they proceeded to\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\nwoods and vines.",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.",
      "In this state I\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\nI had lost.",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay.",
      "There were women weeping around; I\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\ncause.",
      "I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.",
      "The death\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\nfeet.",
      "This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.",
      "I started\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",
      "However, it was\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",
      "I hired men\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\nmental torment in bodily exercise.",
      "But the overflowing misery I now felt,\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\nexertion.",
      "I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\nto every gloomy idea that arose.",
      "If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",
      "Tears streamed from my eyes.",
      "The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\nthen been observed by Elizabeth.",
      "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\na great and sudden change.",
      "The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.",
      "A fiend had\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\nman.",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event?",
      "Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",
      "Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",
      "My\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\nmy hideous narration.",
      "I arrived at Geneva.",
      "My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore.",
      "I see him now, excellent and venerable old\nman!",
      "His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\ndelight his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",
      "Cursed, cursed\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\nin wretchedness!",
      "He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",
      "What then became of me?",
      "I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",
      "Sometimes,\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\ndungeon.",
      "Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\nprison.",
      "For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",
      "As the\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\ncause the monster whom I had created, the miserable d mon whom I had\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction.",
      "I was possessed by a\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\nrevenge on his cursed head.",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.",
      "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.",
      "Be\nassured, sir,  said he,  no pains or exertions on my part shall\nbe spared to discover the villain.",
      "I thank you,  replied I;  listen, therefore, to the\ndeposition that I have to make.",
      "It is indeed a tale so strange that I\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction.",
      "The story is too connected to\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.",
      "My\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.",
      "I now related\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\non his countenance.",
      "When I had concluded my narration, I said,  This is the being whom I\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\nwhole power.",
      "It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\nfunctions on this occasion.",
      "This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\nauditor.",
      "He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\nreturned.",
      "He, however, answered mildly,  I would willingly afford you\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.",
      "Who can follow an\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\nno man would venture to intrude?",
      "Besides, some months have elapsed since\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.",
      "I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\nand destroyed as a beast of prey.",
      "But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.",
      "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.",
      "You are mistaken,  said he.",
      "I will exert myself, and if\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\npunishment proportionate to his crimes.",
      "But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\nmake up your mind to disappointment.",
      "That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.",
      "My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",
      "My rage\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\nloose upon society, still exists.",
      "You refuse my just demand; I have\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\nhis destruction.",
      "I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",
      "But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness.",
      "He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.",
      "Man,  I cried,  how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\nwisdom!",
      "Cease; you know not what it is you say.",
      "I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.",
      "Chapter 24\n\n\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost.",
      "I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.",
      "My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful.",
      "I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.",
      "And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.",
      "I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.",
      "How I\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death.",
      "But revenge kept me alive; I dared\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.",
      "When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.",
      "But my plan was unsettled,\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue.",
      "As night approached I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed.",
      "I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves.",
      "Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver.",
      "The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\nmourner.",
      "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair.",
      "They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",
      "I knelt on the grass\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed,  By the\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d mon who caused this misery,\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",
      "For this purpose I will\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\neyes for ever.",
      "And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.",
      "Let the cursed\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\ntorments me.",
      "I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",
      "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\nlaugh.",
      "It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",
      "Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance.",
      "The laughter died away, when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper,  I am satisfied, miserable wretch!",
      "You have\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.",
      "I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\neluded my grasp.",
      "Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\nmortal speed.",
      "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.",
      "Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",
      "The\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",
      "I\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track.",
      "Sometimes the peasants, scared by\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\nleft some mark to guide me.",
      "The snows descended on my head, and I saw\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain.",
      "To you first entering\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt and still feel?",
      "Cold, want, and fatigue were the\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",
      "Sometimes,\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.",
      "The\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\ninvoked to aid me.",
      "Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d mon\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\ncountry chiefly collected.",
      "In other places human beings were seldom\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath.",
      "I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy.",
      "O blessed sleep!",
      "Often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",
      "The\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",
      "Deprived of\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",
      "During the day I was\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth s\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",
      "Often, when wearied by\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\nfriends.",
      "What agonising fondness did I feel for them!",
      "How did I cling to\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\npersuade myself that they still lived!",
      "At such moments vengeance, that\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\ndestruction of the d mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\nardent desire of my soul.",
      "What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.",
      "Sometimes, indeed, he\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\nme and instigated my fury.",
      "My reign is not yet\nover these words were legible in one of these\ninscriptions you live, and my power is complete.",
      "Follow me; I\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive.",
      "You will find near this place, if\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.",
      "Come on, my\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.",
      "Scoffing devil!",
      "Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death.",
      "Never will I give up my search\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",
      "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",
      "The peasants were\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\nseek for prey.",
      "The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",
      "The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.",
      "One\ninscription that he left was in these words:  Prepare!",
      "Your toils\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\nhatred.",
      "My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\nof the horizon.",
      "Oh!",
      "How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\nsouth!",
      "Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\nits superior wildness and ruggedness.",
      "The Greeks wept for joy when\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\nrapture the boundary of their toils.",
      "I did not weep, but I knelt down\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary s gibe,\nto meet and grapple with him.",
      "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed.",
      "I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day s journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",
      "With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the seashore.",
      "I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend and gained accurate information.",
      "A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\nhis terrific appearance.",
      "He had carried off their store of winter\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\nice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",
      "On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.",
      "He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",
      "Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",
      "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.",
      "I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\ndeparted from land.",
      "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support.",
      "Immense and\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",
      "But\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.",
      "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\ndespondency and grief from my eyes.",
      "Despair had indeed almost secured\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.",
      "Once, after\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",
      "I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within.",
      "Oh!",
      "With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!",
      "Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the d mon; but still my sight was\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\noppressed me, I wept aloud.",
      "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\nhour s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route.",
      "The sledge was still visible, nor\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",
      "I indeed\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days  journey, I\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\nme.",
      "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\never done before.",
      "A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\nand terrific.",
      "I pressed on, but in vain.",
      "The wind arose; the sea roared;\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\ntremendous and overwhelming sound.",
      "The work was soon finished; in a few\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.",
      "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.",
      "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\nat the sight.",
      "I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\nthe direction of your ship.",
      "I had determined, if you were going southwards,\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\npurpose.",
      "I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\nmy enemy.",
      "But your direction was northwards.",
      "You took me on board when my\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",
      "Oh!",
      "When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d mon, allow\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?",
      "If I do,\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death.",
      "And do I dare to ask of you to\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?",
      "No; I am not so selfish.",
      "Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\nshall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.",
      "He is eloquent\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\ntrust him not.",
      "His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\nand fiend-like malice.",
      "Hear him not; call on the names of William,\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\nthrust your sword into his heart.",
      "I will hover near and direct the\nsteel aright.",
      "Walton, _in continuation._\n\n\nAugust 26th, 17 .",
      "You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\nmine?",
      "Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish.",
      "His fine and lovely eyes\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness.",
      "Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",
      "His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\nhowever earnest and connected.",
      "Such a monster has, then, really existence!",
      "I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.",
      "Sometimes I\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\ncreature s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.",
      "Are you mad, my friend?",
      "said he.",
      "Or whither does your\nsenseless curiosity lead you?",
      "Would you also create for yourself and the\nworld a demoniacal enemy?",
      "Peace, peace!",
      "Learn my miseries and do not seek\nto increase your own.",
      "Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\nwith his enemy.",
      "Since you have preserved my narration,  said\nhe,  I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.",
      "Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\ntale that ever imagination formed.",
      "My thoughts and every feeling of my\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created.",
      "I wish to soothe\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\nevery hope of consolation, to live?",
      "Oh, no!",
      "The only joy that he can\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\ndeath.",
      "Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\nremote world.",
      "This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.",
      "Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and\nmisfortunes.",
      "On every point of general literature he displays\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.",
      "His\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\nwithout tears.",
      "What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!",
      "He seems\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.",
      "When younger,  said he,  I believed myself destined for\nsome great enterprise.",
      "My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.",
      "This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures.",
      "When I reflected on the work I had\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.",
      "But\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust.",
      "All my speculations and hopes\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\nchained in an eternal hell.",
      "My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man.",
      "Even now I cannot\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.",
      "I trod\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\nof their effects.",
      "From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\nambition; but how am I sunk!",
      "Oh!",
      "My friend, if you had known me as I once\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation.",
      "Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.",
      "Must I then lose this admirable being?",
      "I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me.",
      "Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\nvalue and lose him.",
      "I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.",
      "I thank you, Walton,  he said,  for your kind intentions towards so\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?",
      "Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?",
      "Even\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain.",
      "They know our\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.",
      "A sister or a\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\ncontemplated with suspicion.",
      "But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear.",
      "They are dead, and but one\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.",
      "If I\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.",
      "But\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.",
      "My beloved Sister,\n\nSeptember 2d.",
      "I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\nit.",
      "I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel.",
      "The brave fellows whom I\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\nnone to bestow.",
      "There is something terribly appalling in our\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.",
      "Yet it is\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\nthrough me.",
      "If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.",
      "And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?",
      "You will not hear of my\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return.",
      "Years will pass, and\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope.",
      "Oh!",
      "My\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.",
      "But you have a husband\nand lovely children; you may be happy.",
      "Heaven bless you and make you so!",
      "My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.",
      "He\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued.",
      "He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.",
      "Even the sailors feel\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man.",
      "These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.",
      "September 5th.",
      "A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\nforbear recording it.",
      "We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\nof being crushed in their conflict.",
      "The cold is excessive, and many of\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation.",
      "Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.",
      "I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.",
      "This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was roused by half\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.",
      "They\nentered, and their leader addressed me.",
      "He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.",
      "We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\nthis.",
      "They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\ncourse southwards.",
      "This speech troubled me.",
      "I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning if set free.",
      "Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand?",
      "I hesitated before I answered, when\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.",
      "Turning towards the men,\nhe said,\n\n What do you mean?",
      "What do you demand of your captain?",
      "Are you, then,\nso easily turned from your design?",
      "Did you not call this a glorious\nexpedition?",
      "And wherefore was it glorious?",
      "Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\nthese you were to brave and overcome.",
      "For this was it a glorious, for this\nwas it an honourable undertaking.",
      "You were hereafter to be hailed as the\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.",
      "And now,\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\nfiresides.",
      "Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\nyourselves cowards.",
      "Oh!",
      "Be men, or be more than men.",
      "Be steady to your\npurposes and firm as a rock.",
      "This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\nshall not.",
      "Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows.",
      "Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.",
      "He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\nyou wonder that these men were moved?",
      "They looked at one another and were\nunable to reply.",
      "I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\nwould return.",
      "They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\nalmost deprived of life.",
      "How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.",
      "Yet I fear such will be my\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.",
      "September 7th.",
      "The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.",
      "Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\nignorant and disappointed.",
      "It requires more philosophy than I possess\nto bear this injustice with patience.",
      "September 12th.",
      "It is past; I am returning to England.",
      "I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory; I have lost my friend.",
      "But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.",
      "September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.",
      "We were\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.",
      "The ice cracked\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\nfree.",
      "When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\nloud and long-continued.",
      "Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\ncause of the tumult.",
      "They shout,  I said,  because they\nwill soon return to England.",
      "Do you, then, really return?",
      "Alas!",
      "Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.",
      "I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.",
      "Do so, if you will; but I will not.",
      "You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.",
      "I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength.",
      "Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.",
      "It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct.",
      "At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty and was unable to speak.",
      "The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.",
      "In the meantime he\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.",
      "His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.",
      "I sat\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\nsaid,  Alas!",
      "The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.",
      "Think\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary.",
      "During these last days I\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.",
      "In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\nwell-being.",
      "This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\nthat.",
      "My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\nmisery.",
      "Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\ncreate a companion for the first creature.",
      "He showed unparalleled malignity\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end.",
      "Miserable himself that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die.",
      "The task of his destruction was\nmine, but I have failed.",
      "When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.",
      "Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him.",
      "But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death.",
      "I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\nmay still be misled by passion.",
      "That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.",
      "The forms of\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.",
      "Farewell,\nWalton!",
      "Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries.",
      "Yet why do I say this?",
      "I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.",
      "His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sank into silence.",
      "About half an hour afterwards he\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\naway from his lips.",
      "Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit?",
      "What can I say that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow?",
      "All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble.",
      "My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment.",
      "But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.",
      "I am interrupted.",
      "What do these sounds portend?",
      "It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.",
      "Again there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie.",
      "I must arise and examine.",
      "Good night, my sister.",
      "Great God!",
      "what a scene has just taken place!",
      "I am yet dizzy with the\nremembrance of it.",
      "I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.",
      "I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\nfriend.",
      "Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\ndescribe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\nproportions.",
      "As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\napparent texture like that of a mummy.",
      "When he heard the sound of my\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\ntowards the window.",
      "Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness.",
      "I shut my eyes involuntarily and\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.",
      "I called on him to stay.",
      "He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\nevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\nuncontrollable passion.",
      "That is also my victim!",
      "he exclaimed.",
      "In his murder my\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\nclose!",
      "Oh, Frankenstein!",
      "Generous and self-devoted being!",
      "What does it\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me?",
      "I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\nby destroying all thou lovedst.",
      "Alas!",
      "He is cold, he cannot answer\nme.",
      "His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",
      "I\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.",
      "I\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.",
      "The monster\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.",
      "At length I\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.",
      "Your repentance,  I said,  is now superfluous.",
      "If you\nhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.",
      "And do you dream?",
      "said the d mon.",
      "Do you think that I was then\ndead to agony and remorse?",
      "He,  he continued, pointing to the corpse,\n he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.",
      "Oh!",
      "Not the\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\nlingering detail of its execution.",
      "A frightful selfishness hurried me\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.",
      "Think you that the\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears?",
      "My heart was fashioned to be\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.",
      "After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\nand overcome.",
      "I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\nabhorred myself.",
      "But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.",
      "I\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.",
      "I\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\ndisobey.",
      "Yet when she died!",
      "Nay, then I was not miserable.",
      "I had\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\ndespair.",
      "Evil thenceforth became my good.",
      "Urged thus far, I had no\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\nchosen.",
      "The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\npassion.",
      "And now it is ended; there is my last victim!",
      "I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me.",
      "Wretch!",
      "I said.",
      "It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\nhave made.",
      "You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.",
      "Hypocritical fiend!",
      "If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.",
      "It is not pity that you\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\nfrom your power.",
      "Oh, it is not thus not thus,  interrupted the being.",
      "Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\nbe the purport of my actions.",
      "Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.",
      "No sympathy may I ever find.",
      "When I first sought it, it was the love of\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated.",
      "But now that virtue has\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
      "I am\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",
      "Once\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.",
      "Once\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.",
      "I was\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.",
      "But now crime has\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal.",
      "No guilt, no mischief, no\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",
      "When I run over the\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",
      "But it is even so; the\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil.",
      "Yet even that enemy of God and man\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.",
      "You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\ncrimes and his misfortunes.",
      "But in the detail which he gave you of them\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\nwasting in impotent passions.",
      "For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\nnot satisfy my own desires.",
      "They were for ever ardent and craving; still\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",
      "Was there no\ninjustice in this?",
      "Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\nhumankind sinned against me?",
      "Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\nfriend from his door with contumely?",
      "Why do you not execrate the rustic\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child?",
      "Nay, these are virtuous\nand immaculate beings!",
      "I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",
      "Even now my\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.",
      "But it is true that I am a wretch.",
      "I have murdered the lovely and\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.",
      "I have\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\nirremediable ruin.",
      "There he lies, white and cold in death.",
      "You hate me, but\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",
      "I look on the\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",
      "Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.",
      "My work\nis nearly complete.",
      "Neither yours nor any man s death is needed to\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\nbut it requires my own.",
      "Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\nsacrifice.",
      "I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\ncreate such another as I have been.",
      "I shall die.",
      "I shall no longer feel the\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\nunquenched.",
      "He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.",
      "I shall no\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.",
      "Light,\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\nhappiness.",
      "Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.",
      "Polluted by\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\ndeath?",
      "Farewell!",
      "I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\neyes will ever behold.",
      "Farewell, Frankenstein!",
      "If thou wert yet alive\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction.",
      "But it was not so; thou\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\nthat which I feel.",
      "Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.",
      "But soon,  he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm,  I\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.",
      "Soon these burning\nmiseries will be extinct.",
      "I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames.",
      "The light of that conflagration\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.",
      "My spirit\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.",
      "Farewell.",
      "He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\nwhich lay close to the vessel.",
      "He was soon borne away by the waves and\nlost in darkness and distance."
